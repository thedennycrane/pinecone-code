<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In <em>Public Prosecutor v Galing
                        Anak Kujat and another</em> [2010] SGHC 212 (“the Trial
                    Judge’s decision”), Jabing Kho (“the Respondent”),
                    and his co-accused, Galing Anak Kujat (“Gailing”), were convicted
                    of murder under s 300(<em>c</em>) read with s 34 and
                    punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“PC”), and Kan Ting Chiu J (“the Trial Judge”)
                    passed the mandatory death sentence on them accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On appeal, the Court of Appeal in <em>Kho Jabing and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] 3 SLR
                    634 (“the CA (Conviction) Decision”) affirmed the
                    Respondent’s conviction and sentence. This CA (which for ease of reference
                    will be referred to as “CA (Conviction)”), however, allowed
                    Galing’s appeal and his conviction of murder was substituted with a
                    conviction of the offence of robbery with hurt committed in furtherance of a
                    common intention under s 394 read with s 34 of the PC. Galing’s case was
                    then remitted back to the Trial Judge for resentencing and he was eventually
                    sentenced to an imprisonment term of 18 years and 6 months and 19 strokes of the
                    cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act No 32
                    of 2012) (“the PCAA”) was then enacted by Parliament to amend the
                    PC. Pertinently, s 2 of the PCAA provide that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

                        Section 302 of the Penal Code is repealed and the following section
                        substituted therefor:</p>

                            imprisonment for life and shall, if he is not punished with death, also
                            be liable to caning.”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As a result of these amendments, except for an accused person

                        and the court is given the discretion to sentence the accused to life
                        imprisonment and caning instead.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">any other Judge of the High Court… may do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 30 April 2013, the Court of Appeal confirmed
                    that the Respondent was convicted under s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    of the PC and allowed his application for his case to be remitted to the High
                    Court for re-sentencing pursuant to s 4(5)(<em>f</em>) of
                    the PCAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The hearing for re-sentencing came before
                    another High Court judge (as the Trial Judge had by then retired from the Bench)
                    (“the Re-sentencing Judge”), who re-sentenced the Respondent to
                    life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest (<em>ie</em>, 26 February 2008) and 24 strokes of the cane (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Kho Jabing</em> [2014] 1 SLR 973
                    (“the Re-sentencing Judge’s Decision”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Prosecution then appealed against the
                    Re-sentencing Judge’s decision, urging this Court to impose the death
                    sentence upon the Respondent on the ground that this was an extremely vicious
                    attack on the victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At the very heart of this appeal lies a critical
                    legal question – for an offence of murder where the mandatory death
                    penalty does not apply, in what circumstances would the death penalty still be
                    warranted?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       This seemingly simple question belies a great
                    deal of difficulties and complications, along with the severe consequences and
                    implications any answer brings. Given that this is the first case of its kind to
                    reach the Court of Appeal since the amendments to the mandatory death penalty
                    were enacted, previous case law was, at best, marginally helpful. In fact, both
                    the Prosecution and counsel for the Respondent were hard-pressed, very
                    understandably so, to suggest any local authority which might be helpful to
                    us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This appeal therefore requires this Court to
                    set down some guidelines and principles as to how this discretion ought to be
                    exercised. After considering the submissions made by the Prosecution and counsel
                    for the Respondent, we allow the Prosecution’s appeal and impose the death
                    sentence on the Respondent. Our detailed reasons for this decision are set out
                    hereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The discretionary death penalty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     During the appeal, we had raised a number of
                    queries to both the counsel for the Respondent and the Prosecution with the
                    objective of clarifying exactly <em>how</em> the court
                    should come to its decision as to the circumstances when the death penalty, as
                    compared to life imprisonment and caning, would be the more appropriate sentence
                    in a case like this. In sum, the numerous questions can be condensed into two
                    broad questions which accurately capture our concerns:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     What circumstances should the Court
                        take into consideration?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Do the normal sentencing principles
                    apply?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Keeping these two questions in mind,
                        we examine three areas which might be potentially helpful – (1) the
                        parliamentary debates for the amendments to the mandatory death penalty, (2)
                        decisions of foreign jurisdictions, and (3) analogous local case
                        authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Parliamentary debates</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Obviously the first matter which we ought to
                    consider in this regard would be the parliamentary debates concerning the
                    enactment of the PCAA. In the debates during the introduction of the amendments
                    (see Changes to the Application of the Mandatory Death Penalty to Homicide
                    Offences (Statement by Minister for Law), <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (9 July 2012) vol 89), the
                    Minister for Law explained that three factors would be relevant in deciding when
                    the death penalty is appropriate:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In deciding whether and how to apply the death penalty to a particular
                        offence, several factors have to be considered. In particular I will
                        mention, in broad terms, three interconnected factors: (1) the seriousness
                        of the offence, both in terms of the harm that the commission of the offence
                        is likely to cause to the victim and to society, and the personal
                        culpability of the accused; (2) how frequent or widespread an offence is;
                        and (3) deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These three factors must be considered in their totality. For example, the
                        fact that an offence is not widespread or that its incidence is low may not,
                        by itself, be a decisive factor. The overarching aim of the Government is to
                        ensure the safety and security of Singapore, while maintaining a fair and
                        just criminal system.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Intentional killing within the meaning of 300(a) is one of the most
                        serious offences in our books. Put simply, this is a case where the offender
                        intends the death of the victim. It is right to punish such offenders with
                        the most severe penalty. It is right to provide for the most powerful
                        deterrent against such offences. It is right, therefore, that the mandatory
                        death penalty should continue to apply to such intentional killing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In respect of other categories of murder, under section 300(b) to (d),
                        there could be different degrees of intention, and these offences are
                        committed in a variety of situations. Today, that is something considered by
                        the Public Prosecutor when he decides the appropriate charge in each case.
                            <em>The factors he considers include the
                            </em><b><em>precise intention </em></b><em>of the accused, the manner in which the homicide occurred and
                            the deterrent effect a charge may have on others. We want to move
                            towards a framework where the court also has the discretion, to take the
                            </em><b><em>same factors </em></b><em>into account during sentencing.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This change will ensure that our sentencing framework properly balances
                        the various objectives: justice to the victim, justice to society, justice
                        to the accused, and mercy in appropriate cases. … We now have a
                        relatively low incidence of homicides – last year we had 16 recorded
                        homicides, or about 0.3 per 100,000 population. As our society becomes
                        safer, less violent, and more mature, we believe that today’s changes
                        are a right step to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In trying to show how the Re-sentencing Judge
                    had erred, the Prosecution in their submissions for this appeal had analysed
                    these three factors and then “categorized” the circumstances of
                    the case according to these three factors. While the Prosecution should not be
                    faulted for doing so, in our opinion, we find that these factors are best
                    considered <em>in totality</em>, and should serve as
                    guiding considerations rather than distinct factors in deciding whether the
                    death penalty is appropriate. As can be seen, the Minister for Law had explained
                    these three factors in “broad terms”, suggesting that a broad and
                    holistic approach should be taken. At the risk of stating the obvious, the
                    factual matrix and circumstances of each case would be extremely varied, and
                    Parliament could not have intended a formulistic approach in applying these
                    three factors in deciding whether or not the death penalty would be the
                    appropriate sentence for a particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In any event, these three factors, by their
                    nature, do not lend themselves to a formulistic approach – these factors
                    are clearly not “objective” factors which can be
                    “measured” or “fulfilled”. When counsel for the
                    Respondent and the Prosecution were asked whether there were any objective
                    factors which could guide the Court in making its decision, both candidly
                    admitted that apart from suggesting certain objective factors described by the
                    courts of other jurisdictions, they were unable to state any “objective
                    factors” other than what the Minister for Law had stated in the
                    parliamentary debates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     This further reinforces our view that deciding
                    whether or not the death penalty is the appropriate sentence cannot be done in a
                    formulistic manner, unlike, for example, establishing liability for a breach of
                    the duty of care where there are specific elements of the tort which can be
                    established. Therefore, in our opinion, the factors as explained in the
                    parliamentary debates simply point to the general principle that the facts of
                    the case must be considered in their totality in determining the appropriate
                    sentence, and are not meant to be part of a legal test to establish when the
                    death penalty would be appropriate. While there is no doubt that the court
                    should take cognizance of the three factors, they must be considered alongside
                    the whole plethora of circumstances prevailing in that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Foreign decisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Next we examine the decisions from other
                    jurisdictions where a similar discretionary death penalty for murder is also
                    provided. Counsel for the Respondent, both in this appeal and during the
                    re-sentencing hearing below, relied upon a number of decisions from other
                    jurisdictions in submitting that when the court has the discretion to decide
                    whether or not to impose the death penalty, it should only do so in the
                    “worst of the worst” and the “rarest of the rare”
                    cases. In response to these submissions, the Re-sentencing Judge, at [38] of his
                    decision, held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not find it necessary or fruitful to look at decisions in other
                        jurisdictions as to when the death penalty would be appropriate. Each
                        society must decide for itself what type and degree of punishment it wants
                        and needs in the unique context of its values and the level of development
                        on all fronts, including social, cultural and economic ones.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The criminal justice system of a country is
                    the bedrock of a safe and orderly society and is designed to produce order and
                    justice in the relationships between man and man and between man and state. It
                    is at the very heart of a functional and flourishing society, and we cannot
                    emphasize further that it must be built upon the society’s cultural,
                    moral, political and economic norms. This will be especially so for something as
                    controversial and sensitive as the death penalty. On this perspective, we
                    generally agree with the observations of the Re-sentencing Judge as stated
                    above. That said, although decisions from other jurisdictions ought to be viewed
                    with some degree of circumspection, they can, to a certain extent, still provide
                    some guidance in working out our criminal justice system. After all, it is in
                    the collective wisdom of man that perhaps each can find his own illuminating
                    light to guide his path. It will therefore be beneficial to examine a number of
                    decisions from other jurisdictions which have tried to work out a clear and
                    practical approach in meting out the discretionary death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     We start off first with India, from where our
                    Penal Code finds its historical roots. In <em>Bachan Singh v The
                        State Punjab</em> (1980) 2 SCC 684 (“<em>Bachan
                        Singh</em>”), the leading case in India on the discretionary
                    death penalty, the Supreme Court of India held (at [209]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Facts and Figures, albeit incomplete, furnished by the Union of India,
                        show that in the past, courts have inflicted the extreme penalty with
                        extreme infrequency — a fact which attests to the caution and
                        compassion which they have always brought to bear on the exercise of their
                        sentencing discretion in so grave a matter. It is, therefore, imperative to
                        voice the concern that courts, aided by the broad illustrative guidelines
                        indicated by us, will discharge the onerous function with evermore
                        scrupulous care and humane concern, directed along the highroad of
                        legislative policy outlined in Section 354(3) viz. that for persons
                        convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an
                        exception. A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life
                        postulates resistance to taking a life through law’s instrumentality.
                            <em>That ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare
                            cases when the alternative option is unquestionably
                            foreclosed</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The “rarest of rare” principle
                    laid down in <em>Bachan Singh</em> continues to be the
                    guiding principle for the Indian courts applying the discretionary death
                    penalty. It is important however to understand the legislative context in which
                    this principle arose from. Originally, pursuant to s 367(5) of the 1898 Indian
                    Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No V of 1898) (“1898 CCP”), the
                    Courts in India were mandated by statute to state reasons if the death penalty
                    was not passed, whenever the accused was convicted of an offence with the
                    discretionary death penalty. Section 367(5) of the 1898 CCP provided
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death and the
                        Court sentences him to any punishment other than death, the Court shall in
                        its judgment state the reason why sentence of death was not passed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     A different position was however taken when
                    the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure (Act 2 of 1974) (“1973 CCP”)
                    was enacted. Section 354(3) of the 1973 CPC provided that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the conviction is for an offence punishable with death, or, in the
                        alternative, with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years,
                        the judgment shall state the reasons for the sentence awarded, and, in the
                        case of sentence of death, the <em>special reasons</em>
                        for such sentence. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The 1973 CCP therefore effectively reversed
                    the position as it existed under the 1898 CCP – the Indian Court now has
                    the duty to give <em>special reasons</em> if the sentence
                    of death is imposed. Given this legislative change, it is therefore not
                    surprising that the Court in <em>Bachan Singh</em> was
                    ready to find that it was only in the “rarest of rare” cases that
                    the death penalty should be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Shortly after <em>Bachan
                        Singh</em>, the Supreme Court of India fine-tuned its approach as to
                    what would be a “rarest of rare” case. In <em>Machhi Singh v State of Punjab</em> (1983) 3 SCC 470
                        (“<em>Machhi Singh</em>”), the Supreme
                    Court of India considered that five factors could be relevant. Four of them
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The manner of commission of the
                        murder;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        motive for the murder;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     The anti-social or abhorrent nature of the crime;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        magnitude of the crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At [33] to [36], it described the four factors
                    as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I. Manner of Commission of murder</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33.    When the murder is
                            committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting, or
                            dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the
                            community. For instance,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>i</em>) When the house of the victim is set
                            aflame with the end in view to roast him alive in the house.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>ii</em>) When the victim is subjected to
                            inhuman acts of torture or cruelty in order to bring about his or her
                            death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>iii</em>) When the body of the victim is cut
                            into pieces or his body is dismembered in a fiendish manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">II. Motive for commission of murder</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34.    When the murder is committed for a motive which
                            evinces total depravity and meanness. For instance when (<em>a</em>) a hired assassin commits murder for the sake
                            of money or reward (<em>b</em>) a cold-blooded
                            murder is committed with a deliberate design in order to inherit
                            property or to gain control over property of a ward or a person under
                            the control of the murderer or vis-a-vis whom the murderer is in a
                            dominating position or in a position of trust, or (<em>c</em>) a murder is committed in the course for betrayal of
                            the motherland.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">III. Anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35. (<em>a</em>) When murder of a Scheduled Caste or
                        minority community etc., is committed not for personal reasons but in
                        circumstances which arouse social wrath. For instance when such a crime is
                        committed in order to terrorize such persons and frighten them into fleeing
                        from a place or in order to deprive them of, or make them surrender, lands
                        or benefits conferred on them with a view to reverse past in justices [sic]
                        and in order to restore the social balance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) In cases of “bride
                        burning” and what are known as “dowry deaths” or when
                        murder is committed in order to remarry for the sake of extracting dowry
                        once again or to marry another woman on account of infatuation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">IV. Magnitude of crime</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36.    When the crime is enormous in proportion. For
                            instance when multiple murders say of all or almost all the members of a
                            family or a large number of persons of a particular caste, community, or
                            locality, are committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Supreme Court of India also felt that the
                    “personality of victim of murder” would be a relevant factor.
                    Eventually, the Supreme Court of India endorsed a “balance sheet”
                    approach (at [38(<em>iv</em>)]), where:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be
                        drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances has to be accorded
                        full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating
                        and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     By identifying the factors above, it would
                    appear that the Supreme Court of India was placing emphasis on both the crime
                    and the criminal in evaluating the appropriateness of the death penalty. The
                    “balance sheet” approach in determining whether a case was the
                    “rarest of the rare” continued to apply for a period of time. It
                    would later however transpire that there was much practical difficulty in
                    applying this test. We do not propose to go through an extensive review of
                    Indian case law, but suffice it to say that in <em>Sangeet v
                        State of Haryana</em> (2013) 2 SCC 452, the Supreme Court of India
                    discussed a number of cases ever since <em>Bachan
                        Singh</em>, and found that there had been “little or no
                    uniformity in the application of this approach” (referring to the
                    “balance sheet approach” advocated in <em>Machhi
                        Singh</em>). At [77], it conclusively did away with this balance sheet
                    approach, stating that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77.1. This Court has not endorsed the approach of
                            aggravating and mitigating circumstances in <em>Bachan
                                Singh</em>. However, this approach has been adopted in several
                            decisions. This needs a fresh look. In any event, there is little or no
                            uniformity in the application of this approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77.2. Aggravating circumstances relate to the crime
                            while mitigating circumstances relate to the criminal. A balance sheet
                            cannot be drawn up for comparing the two. The considerations for both
                            are distinct and unrelated. The use of the mantra of aggravating and
                            mitigating circumstances needs a review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77.3. In the sentencing process, both the crime and the criminal are
                        equally important. We have, unfortunately, not taken the sentencing process
                        as seriously as it should be with the result that in capital offences, it
                        has become judge-centric sentencing rather than principled
                        sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clearly, while the “rarest of rare” principle
                        endorsed in <em>Bachan Singh</em> continues to be the
                        guiding principle in India, its history has shown that the practical
                        application of such a principle is fraught with
                difficulty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We note that the “rarest of
                    rare” principle is not unique to India. In <em>R v
                        Trimmingham</em> [2009] UKPC 25 (an appeal from the Court of Appeal of
                    St Vincent and the Grenadines), the Privy Council likewise endorsed a similar
                    principle. In observing that the approach a sentencing judge should follow in a
                    case where the imposition of the death sentence is discretionary was relatively
                    well-established by the Caribbean Courts, the Privy Council at [21] held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[i]t can be expressed in two basic principles. The first has been
                        expressed in several different formulations, but they all carry the same
                        message, that the death penalty should be imposed <em>only in
                            cases which on the facts of the offence are the most extreme and
                            exceptional, “the worst of the worst” or “the
                            rarest of the rare”</em>. In considering whether a
                        particular case falls into that category, the judge should of course compare
                        it with other murder cases and not with ordinary civilised behaviour. The
                        second principle is that there must be no reasonable prospect of reform of
                        the offender and that the object of punishment could not be achieved by any
                        means other than the ultimate sentence of death. The character of the
                        offender and any other relevant circumstances are to be taken into account
                        in so far as they may operate in his favour by way of mitigation and are not
                        to weigh in the scales against him. Before it imposes a sentence of death
                        the court must be properly satisfied that these two criteria have been
                        fulfilled. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Given the additional requirement that there must be no
                        reasonable prospect of reform of the offender and no other means by which to
                        achieve the object of punishment, it could even be said that the Caribbean
                        Courts apply a stricter test than the “rarest of the rare”
                        approach in India.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the United States, a similar “rarest
                    of the rare” principle seems to apply. The death penalty is only awarded
                    in the most extreme of circumstances – in <em>Roper v
                        Simmonds</em> 543 US 551 (2005) at 568, the US Supreme Court citing
                    its previous decision in <em>Atkins v Virginia</em> 536 US
                    304 (2002) at 319, held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[c]apital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit
                        “a narrow category of the most serious crimes” and whose
                        extreme culpability makes them “the most deserving of
                        execution.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Furthermore, a non-exhaustive list of factors
                    the US Courts must consider is also statutorily provided for in Title 18,
                    Chapter 228, Section 3592 of the United States Code. These factors include
                    impaired capacity, duress, minor participation, equally culpable defendants,
                    heinous, cruel, or depraved manner of committing offense, pecuniary gain and
                    substantial planning and premeditation, to name a few.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Local case authorities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Finally, we turn to local case authorities. As
                    mentioned above, this is the first case of its kind (brought about by the
                    amendments to the PC – see [3] above) to be decided by us and there are no
                    reported local case authorities <em>directly</em> on point.
                    There is however, a decision based on the offence of gang-robber with murder in
                    the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC (1985)”) which
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Gang-robbery with
                            murder</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>396.</b>  If any one of 5 or more
                        persons who are conjointly committing gang-robbery, commits murder in so

                        death or imprisonment for life, and if he is not sentenced to death, shall
                        also be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Section 396 of the PC (1985) which is
                    similarly worded to s 302(2) of the PC (the provision under consideration in the
                    present case), was interpreted and applied by the Court of Appeal in <em>Panya Martmontree and others v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995]
                    2 SLR(R) 806 (“<em>Panya</em>”). In
                    dismissing the appeal and confirming the sentences of death passed by the High
                    Court, the Court of Appeal at [66] noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the appellants went to the Tampines site to steal valuable equipment,
                        like surveying equipment, as was in fact stolen, armed with lethal weapons
                        they must have intended to cause grievous bodily harm and even death to
                        anyone who stood in their way. This is what they in fact did. <em>Their acts of violence were mercilessly executed and gravely
                            abhorrent in their execution</em>. In our view, <em>these acts of violence were amply sufficient to "outrage the
                            feeling</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>of the community"</em>. Further in our judgment there was
                        no reason to discriminate between them as they were all in it together and
                        it cannot be said with any certainty which of them inflicted the fatal blows
                        and which of them took a passive role. The learned judge had not erred.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We note the strong language used by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Panya</em> to describe the acts of the
                    offenders in its decision to uphold the death penalty. Particularly, the Court
                    of Appeal had used the phrase “outrage the feeling[s] of the
                    community” in evaluating the acts of the offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     This phrase originated from the decision in
                        <em>Sia Ah Kew and others v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1974 – 1976] SLR(R) 54 (“<em>Sia Ah
                    Kew</em>”), which was cited with approval in <em>Panya</em>. <em>Sia Ah Kew</em> was a case
                    involving kidnapping for ransom, an offence under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap
                    101, 1970 Rev Ed) which provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whoever, with intent to hold any person for ransom, abducts or wrongfully
                        restrains or wrongfully confines such person shall be guilty of an offence
                        and shall be punished on conviction with death or imprisonment for life and
                        shall, if he is not sentenced to death, also be liable to caning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Here, the court likewise had the discretion in
                    deciding whether or not to impose the death penalty. The Court of Appeal first
                    noted at [3] that given the wording of the statute, the courts had:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… a very limited discretion with regard to sentence, the discretion
                        being limited to the imposition of one of three sentences, the maximum being
                        death and the minimum being imprisonment for life. The third is imprisonment
                        for life with caning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In deciding when to impose the maximum
                    penalty, that is, the death penalty, the Court of Appeal held at [5]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [i]t is a long and well established principle of sentencing that
                        the Legislature in fixing the maximum penalty for a criminal offence intends
                        it only for the worst cases. <em>However</em>, in the
                        case of the offence of kidnapping for ransom <em>the
                            discretion given to the courts as regards the sentence is, as earlier
                            stated, very limited in scope</em>. In our opinion the maximum
                        sentence prescribed by the Legislature would be appropriate where the manner
                        of the kidnapping or the acts or <em>conduct of the
                            kidnappers are such as to outrage the feelings of the
                            community</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Court of Appeal, after reviewing the facts of the case,
                        eventually held that the circumstances did not point to a case where the
                        maximum sentence of death would be the appropriate sentence to
                        impose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision to impose the death penalty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We will now review the points that we have
                    raised above and set out our views as to their relevance in this
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     First, the three factors alluded to in the
                    relevant parliamentary debates are non-exhaustive and are just guiding
                    considerations which the court should bear in mind when determining whether the
                    death penalty is an appropriate sentence in a specific case. In our opinion, the
                    parliamentary debates do not suggest that the courts should only pay or pay
                    particular credence to these three factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is our judgment that the trite and well
                    established sentencing principle that all the circumstances and factors of the
                    case must be taken into consideration in meting out an appropriate sentence
                    continues to apply, and this is supported by the fact that the Minister for Law
                    had stated the three factors in broad terms and specifically mentioned that they
                    were to be considered in totality. As we see it, these three factors were
                    highlighted because they will very likely surface in any evaluation of a case
                    involving the discretionary death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, the leading principle in other
                    jurisdictions, as the survey above touching on the positions in India, St
                    Vincent and Grenadines, and the United States shows, is that the death penalty
                    should only be imposed for the “rarest of rare” or the
                    “worst of the worst” cases. To follow this principle would mean
                    that it is only in the most extreme of circumstances and the narrowest of cases
                    that the death penalty would be imposed. The practical implication of this
                    principle can be illustrated briefly by a number of cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Manohar Lal alias Mannu
                        &amp; Another v State (NCT) of Delhi</em> (2000) 2 SCC 92, the
                    offenders burned four sons alive in front of their mother. On appeal, the death
                    penalty was set aside because the Supreme Court of India felt that the
                    assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had “blinded” the
                    offenders, leading them to a rampage triggered by a demented psyche. The
                    offenders “had no special or personal animosity towards anyone of the
                    deceased individually” (at [7]). Pertinently, the Supreme Court of India
                    also (at [9]) cited a previous decision, <em>Kishori v State of
                        Delhi</em> [1999] 1 SCC 148, where the facts were analogous and where
                    the death penalty was not imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>Ravindra Trimbak
                        Chouthmal v State of Maharashtra</em> (1996) 4 SCC 148, the victim was
                    murdered, her head severed from her body, and her body cut up into nine pieces
                    and kept in two suitcases which was subsequently disposed of. This was a case of
                    “dowry death”, where the murder was the result of the
                    husband’s family being unhappy with the dowry received from the marriage.
                    The Supreme Court of India overturned the High Court’s decision to impose
                    the death penalty, and at [9] and [10], observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    The present was thus a murder most foul, as pointed
                            out by us in the opening paragraph. The motive was to get another girl
                            for the appellant who could get dowry to satisfy the greed of the
                            father. Dowry-deaths are blood- boiling, as human blood is spilled to
                            satisfy raw-greed, naked greed; a greed which has no limit. Nonetheless,
                            question is whether the extreme penalty was merited in the present
                            case?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    We have given considered thought to the question
                            and we have not been able to place the case in that category which could
                            be regarded as the "rarest of the rare" type. This is so because dowry
                            death has ceased to belong to <em>that</em> species
                            of killing. The increasing number of dowry deaths would bear this. To
                            halt the rising graph, we, at one point, thought to maintain the
                            sentence; but we entertain doubt about the deterrent effect of a death
                            penalty. We, therefore, resist ourselves from upholding the death
                            sentence, much though we would have desired annihilation of a despicable
                            character like the appellant before us. We, therefore character like the
                            appellant before us. We, therefore, commute the sentence of death to one
                            of RI for life imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is clear therefore that the “number” of
                        occurrences of the crime features as a consideration in deciding what is the
                        “rarest of the rare”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In our respectful opinion, we do not find that
                    the “rarest of rare” principle is appropriate for Singapore. To
                    adopt this principle would be to artificially confine and sequester the death
                    penalty to the narrowest of regions and to restrict the imposition of the death
                    penalty based on whether the actions of the offender are “rare” in
                    comparison with other offenders. This should not be the case in our context.
                    Admittedly, the often cited sentencing principle is that the maximum penalty is
                    only intended for the worst form of cases (see for example, <em>Sim Gek Yong v PP</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 at [13], which was cited
                    with approval in the Re-sentencing Judge’s Decision at
                [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     However, the context in which this principle
                    was laid down is different in the sense that in the normal case the sentencing
                    judge has a much wider discretion and a range of penalties from which to choose
                    from. In such a scenario, given that there is a range of penalties reflecting
                    differing degrees of moral culpability, it would make sense that it is only in
                    the worst form of cases that the maximum penalty should be meted out. However,
                    this is not the case with the discretionary death penalty. To quote the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Sia Ah Kew</em> at [5], the
                    “discretion given to the courts as regards the sentence is… very
                    limited in scope”; the court does not have the luxury to choose from a
                    range of penalties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Given the fact that the discretion is confined
                    to only the imposition of either the death sentence or life imprisonment with
                    caning, we do not find that the “rarest of the rare” principle
                    effectively meets the objective of having the discretionary death penalty in our
                    sentencing regime. As explained by the Minister for Law in the parliamentary
                    debates, the objective behind introducing the discretionary death penalty was to
                    balance “the various objectives: justice to the victim, justice to
                    society, justice to the accused, and mercy in appropriate cases”. All
                    these considerations must be taken into account, and we do not think that they
                    would be properly reflected if we should adopt the “rarest of the
                    rare” principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In our judgment, a more appropriate principle
                    to follow would be that laid down by the Court of Appeal in <em>Sia Ah Kew</em>, which is, whether the actions of the offender would
                        <em>outrage the feelings of the community</em>.
                    Undoubtedly, capital punishment is an expression of society’s indignation
                    towards particularly offensive conduct, and the fact that the death penalty
                    continues to be part of our sentencing regime is an expression of
                    society’s belief that certain actions are so grievous an affront to
                    humanity and so abhorrent that the death penalty may, in the face of such
                    circumstances, be the appropriate, if not the only, adequate sentence. It would
                    therefore, in our judgment, be correct to consider the strong feelings of the
                    community in deciding whether or not to impose the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In determining whether the actions of the
                    offender would outrage the feelings of the community, we find that the death
                    penalty would be the appropriate sentence when the offender has acted in a way
                    which exhibits viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life. Viewed in this
                    light, it is the <em>manner</em> in which the offender
                    acted which takes centre stage. For example, in the case of a violent act
                    leading to death, the <em>savagery of the attack</em> would
                    be indicative of the offender’s regard for human life. The number of stabs
                    or blows, the area of the injury, the duration of the attack and the force used
                    would all be pertinent factors to be considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We would observe that the significance of each
                    of these factors would invariably vary, depending on the circumstances of the
                    case. For example, the factors to consider would be extremely different in a
                    case of non-violent acts leading to death, such as where the death was caused by
                    poisoning. It is the offender’s (dis)regard for human life which will be
                    critical. This explains why an offence under s 300(<em>a</em>) of the PC, where the offender had the clear <em>intention</em> to cause death, still carries the mandatory
                    death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Therefore when an offender acts in a way which
                    exhibits a blatant disregard for human life which is just shy of the requisite
                    intention to sustain a charge under s 300(<em>a</em>) of
                    the PC, the imposition of the death penalty would be the appropriate sentence to
                    reflect the moral culpability of such an offender. This approach would also be
                    in accordance with what the Minister for Law had explained as being the
                        <em>seriousness of the offence, personal culpability of the
                        accused</em> and <em>the manner in which the homicide
                        occurred</em> in the parliamentary debates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     That said, the court should still take into
                    consideration all the other circumstances of the case. While the
                    offender’s regard for human life remains at the forefront of the
                    court’s consideration, other facts such as the offender’s age and
                    intelligence continue to be relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Ellarry bin Puling and another</em> [2011] SGHC 214 (“<em>Fabian</em>”), F and E were foreigners on work permits
                    in Singapore. On 22 August 2008, they set out on bicycles to find victims to
                    rob. F was armed with a piece of wood which he had picked up the night before,
                    with the intention of striking his victims with it before robbing them. In the
                    early morning of 23 August 2008, F and E spotted the deceased sitting alone at a
                    bus stop using his phone. F approached the person from behind and hit him on the
                    head three times, before tripping him and kicking him when he was on the ground.
                    The victim was then robbed. The victim later fell into a coma, and eventually
                    succumbed to his injuries. The cause of death was certified to be intracranial
                    haemorrhage and cerebral contusions due to a fractured skull. F was convicted of
                    murder under s 300(<em>c</em>) of the PC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     F’s conviction was upheld on appeal (in
                    Criminal Case Appeal No 15 of 2011) and his case was subsequently sent back for
                    resentencing under the relevant provisions of the PCAA. At the resentencing
                    hearing (Criminal Case No 40 of 2009), the trial judge in that case found that
                    although the attack was vicious, he took into account the fact that the accused
                    was young (18 years old at the time of offence) and had sub-normal intelligence
                    in eventually deciding not to impose the death penalty. This is an example of
                    how the court must continue to take into consideration all the other
                    circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     We summarize our views on the principles
                    guiding this court in determining when it would be appropriate to impose the
                    death penalty as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     The factors alluded to by the
                        Minister for Law in the parliamentary debates are clearly relevant
                        considerations. However, no especial credence should be placed on them. The
                        well-established sentencing principle that all the circumstances and factors
                        of the case must be taken into consideration in meting out an appropriate
                        sentence continues to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     The “rarest of rare” principle is not
                        applicable in our legislative scheme of things. A more appropriate principle
                        to follow would be the one laid down by the Court of Appeal in <em>Sia Ah Kew</em>, which is to discern whether the actions
                        of the offender would <em>outrage the feelings of the
                            community</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     In determining whether the actions of the offender would
                        outrage the feelings of the community and in turn warrant the imposition of
                        the death penalty, the court must consider whether the offender has acted in
                        a way which exhibits a <em>blatant disregard for human
                            life</em>. Thus the <em>manner</em> in which
                        the offender acted would be critical. The factors to be taken into
                        consideration to determine this would vary depending on the circumstances of
                        the case. In the case of a violent act leading to death, the <em>savagery of the attack</em> would be indicative of the
                        offender’s disregard for human life.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_d"></a>(d)     In any event, all the circumstances of the case
                        must be weighed including the motive and intention of the offender at the
                        time he committed the offence. While the offender’s regard for human
                        life remains at the forefront of the court’s consideration, other
                        factors such as the offender’s age and intelligence could well tilt
                        the balance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>With these principles in
                        mind, we now turn to consider the facts of the present
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The manner in which the murder was committed</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decisions below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Central to our inquiry is the manner in which
                    the Respondent had committed the murder. To do this would require revisiting the
                    facts of the case. Keeping in mind the role of an appellate court and that, as
                    far as possible, we should not be disturbing findings of fact, we turn first to
                    the findings of facts concerning the attack as found in the Re-sentencing
                    Judge’s Decision, the CA (Conviction) Decision, and the Trial
                    Judge’s Decision. It is important to note that the Re-sentencing Judge had
                    relied entirely on the Trial Judge’s Decision and the CA (Conviction)
                    Decision where the facts of the case were concerned. At [35] of his decision,
                    the Re-sentencing Judge stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I was not the trial Judge in this case, I relied entirely on Kan
                        J’s judgment… and the Court of Appeal’s judgment…
                        where the findings of fact were concerned. I do not think I should look
                        further into the evidence adduced at the trial and make further conclusions
                        on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>He later concluded at [40(c)] of his decision
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was no clear sequence of events concerning the attack. There was no
                        clear evidence that the convicted person went after the deceased from behind
                        without warning and started hitting him on the head with the piece of wood.
                        There was evidence that a struggle could have taken place first between
                        Galing and the deceased before the convicted person stopped chasing Wu Jun
                        and returned to assault the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Re-sentencing Judge’s conclusion
                    that “there was no clear sequence of events concerning the attack”
                    was therefore his interpretation of the findings made by the CA (Conviction). At
                    [8] to [10] of the CA (Conviction) Decision, the court had observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8 The exact chain of events which occurred during the assault
                        is disputed. Galing stated that Jabing led the way in:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) crossing the road (in order to reach the victims);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) intimating that the appellants (Galing and Jabing) should rob the
                            victims;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) picking up the piece of wood; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) striking the deceased with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further, according to Galing:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) he told Jabing not to rob the victims but was ignored by
                            Jabing;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) he assaulted Wu Jun (after the deceased had already been assaulted
                            by Jabing with the piece of wood) because Wu Jun seemed to be about to
                            attack Jabing;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) he chased Wu Jun for some distance before returning to where
                            Jabing and the deceased were located;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) Wu Jun returned to the scene of the assault, and Jabing chased Wu
                            Jun away a second time before he (Galing) called Jabing back.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9 Jabing, however, stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) it was Galing who first crossed the road to approach the
                            victims;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) Galing had by then already wrapped his belt around his
                            hand;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) Galing was already about to strike the deceased with the belt in
                            his hands by the time Jabing picked up the piece of wood;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) he (Jabing) chased after Wu Jun, who had fled the scene of the
                            assault;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) he (Jabing) gave up the chase and returned to the scene of the
                            assault, where he saw Galing struggling with the deceased; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f) he (Jabing) then struck the deceased with the piece of wood twice,
                            after which he then fled the scene of the assault, but not before
                            noticing Galing hitting the deceased with his belt and having taken the
                            deceased’s mobile phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10 To complicate matters, Wu Jun’s evidence in his statement was
                        that, while walking together with the deceased at the material time, he felt
                        something hard hit him at the back of his head. He ran a few steps forward,
                        turned round, and saw a man with a tanned complexion, wearing a cap, coming
                        towards him in a menacing manner with a clenched fist, whereupon he (Wu Jun)
                        fled the scene. Wu Jun’s evidence was that he could hear the deceased
                        groaning in pain. After running for a while, Wu Jun called for the police on
                        his mobile phone, and subsequently returned to the scene of the assault,
                        where he discovered the deceased lying unconscious and vomiting blood. Wu
                        Jun also noted that the deceased’s mobile phone was missing. At trial,
                        Wu Jun stated that he noticed only one assailant that night, and was unable
                        to say whether he or the deceased was attacked first, how the deceased was
                        attacked or who attacked the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Even though the accounts of the Respondent and
                    Galing are clearly contradictory, neither the CA (Conviction) nor the Trial
                    Judge made findings as to the exact sequence of events. Though unfortunate, this
                    is understandable because at that point in time there was no need for the court
                    to decide conclusively and exactly how the events took place as the charge
                    against the Respondent and Galing was under s 300(<em>c</em>) of the PC. All that was needed for the Prosecution to prove
                    was that the Respondent had intended to inflict the injury which led to the
                    death of the deceased. As the law then stood, whether an accused was found
                    guilty of an offence under s 300(<em>a</em>) or s
                        300(<em>c</em>), the punishment would be the same,
                        <em>ie</em> the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     We also note that the Re-sentencing Judge did
                    not make any findings as to the number of times the Respondent had struck the
                    deceased. There are however a number of observations concerning this in the CA
                    (Conviction) Decision. After considering the statements given to the police by
                    Galing, the CA (Conviction) observed at [25] to [27] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25 … Although Galing later attempted to question the accuracy of
                        these statements in what appears to be a belated attempt to downplay
                        Jabing's culpability… there was little reason to doubt that they had
                        been correctly recorded. Galing's statements, therefore, <em>were evidence that Jabing struck the deceased more than twice, and with
                            considerable violence</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26 The violent assault on the deceased was corroborated by the medical
                        evidence (summarised at [22]-[29] of the [the Trial Judge’s
                        Decision]), which was that the deceased had sustained life-threatening
                        injuries to his head and brain. <em>There was evidence from
                            the forensic pathologist, Dr Teo Eng Swee ("Dr Teo"), that there could
                            have been more than five blows to the deceased's head</em>, and
                        both Dr Teo and Dr Ho Chi Long (the physician who first attended the
                        deceased at the accident and emergency room) were of the opinion that at
                        least some of the injuries required "very severe" or "huge" blunt force from
                        several blows to be inflicted. Dr Teo added that one of the fractures that
                        resulted in the initial fragmentation of the skull required "severe
                        force".</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27 In light of all this evidence, as well as the fact that the severe
                        injuries found on the deceased were concentrated at the region of his head,
                            <em>it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Jabing
                            intended to, and did, inflict multiple head injuries on the
                            deceased</em>, and that such injuries were certainly not
                        accidental or unintentional.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The paragraphs above, read together, clearly
                    show that the CA (Conviction) found that the Respondent had struck the deceased
                    on the head with severe force <em>more than two times</em>.
                    Of course, as earlier explained, neither the CA (Conviction) nor the Trial Judge
                    was required to make a specific finding as to the exact number of times the
                    Respondent had struck the deceased on the head. We also note that the Trial
                    Judge (at [24] to [28] of his decision) had made similar observations as to the
                    medical evidence before him, but did not conclusively state the number of
                    strikes the Respondent had inflicted upon the deceased:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Pathologist Dr Teo Eng Swee
                            (“Dr Teo”) performed the autopsy on the deceased. In
                            his autopsy report he noted that there were fourteen fractures of the
                            skull with three areas of severe haemorrhage, and that the brain was
                            soft and severely oedematous (swollen). Dr Teo certified the cause
                            of death to be severe head injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25     Dr Teo explained that the severe head
                        injury recorded in his autopsy report did not refer to the fractures of the
                        skull. The fractures by themselves were not the fatal injury. The fatal
                        injury was the injury to the brain…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26     Dr Teo was of the opinion that the
                        skull fractures could have been caused by five impacts or more, and that one
                        fracture could have resulted from a blow or a fall on the back of the head,
                        and that the initial fragmentation of the skull required severe force, but
                        when the skull was fractured, the further fractures could be caused by less
                        severe force.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27     The prosecutor showed Dr Teo the belt
                        and buckle that Galing used in the assault, and sought Dr Teo’s
                        assistance to make connections between the buckle and the deceased’s
                        injuries, but Dr Teo was cautious and declined to draw any
                        conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28     When Dr Teo was informed of
                        Galing’s account in his statement that a severed tree branch about two
                        feet long was used by Jabing to strike at the deceased,
                        Dr Teo agreed that such a weapon was capable of causing the injuries
                        that were found on the deceased’s skull.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The specific issue which we must now address
                    is: do the facts discussed above show that the Respondent acted in a way which
                    demonstrated a blatant disregard for human life in committing the murder? As we
                    see it, two points can be made concerning the injuries that were inflicted upon
                    the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The Respondent approached the deceased from behind</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     First, although it is true that the sequence
                    of events is unclear, we find that the Re-sentencing Judge had erred in finding
                    at [40(c)] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [t]here was no clear evidence the [Respondent] went after the
                        deceased from behind without warning and started hitting him on the head

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>While it remains uncertain whether a struggle indeed occurred
                        beforehand between Galing and the deceased, the evidence clearly shows that

                        without warning. In fact, the Respondent himself had admitted to this at
                        various occasions during the trial. The following parts of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Read together, even if it is assumed that
                    there was a struggle between the deceased and Galing, there remains no doubt
                    that the Respondent had admitted to coming from behind and hitting the deceased
                    from the back. In our opinion, the Re-sentencing Judge had therefore erred by
                    finding that there was no clear evidence showing that position. In any case,
                    whether or not there was a struggle beforehand is of little significance to the
                    Respondent’s culpability, given how the injuries were eventually
                    inflicted. First, it must be borne in mind that this alleged struggle was
                    between the deceased and Galing, and not with the Respondent – any claims
                    that the strikes were made “in the heat of the moment” would
                    therefore be unpersuasive. Second, even if some consideration could be given to
                    the fact that the Respondent was returning to “aid” Galing, this
                    might only explain the Respondent’s first strike at best. However, it does
                    little to explain or mitigate the additional strikes the Respondent dealt to the
                    deceased given that <em>after</em> the first strike by the
                    Respondent, the deceased had fallen onto the ground and was not retaliating.
                    After the first blow, there was effectively no more struggle. Why was there a
                    need to rain further blows on the head of the deceased then?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The number of blows</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With this, we turn to our second point, which
                    is the number of times the Respondent had struck the deceased. Throughout the
                    proceedings, the Respondent maintained his position that he had struck the
                    deceased only twice – once when he approached the deceased from the back
                    (regardless of whether or not it was in the midst of a struggle), and once after
                    the deceased had fallen down and turned over to the front. However, as mentioned
                    above (at [56]), the CA (Conviction) found that the Respondent had taken more
                    than two strikes at the deceased. In particular, the CA (Conviction) had
                    considered Galing’s statements to the police, where Galing had mentioned
                    that he:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… saw [the Respondent] hitting the [deceased] <em>several times</em> and his head <em>cracked
                            open</em>. … I really regretted that [the Respondent] hit
                        him <em>so many times</em> until he died …
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>and also (in another statement) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I gave up the chase and turned back towards Jabing who was
                        hitting the other Chinese with the wood in his hands <em>repeatedly</em> … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     For completeness, we note that during the
                    trial, Galing changed his evidence to state that he had only seen Jabing strike
                    the deceased once, and sought to explain that his police statements were
                    recorded inaccurately. However, the Trial Judge was of the opinion that this
                    allegation was unsustainable and found that the police officers had accurately
                    recorded Galing’s statements (see [47] of the Trial Judge’s
                    Decision). This was noted and affirmed by the CA (Conviction) (see [25] of the
                    CA (Conviction) Decision).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As discussed above, the CA (Conviction) also
                    took note of the evidence of the pathologist, Dr Teo Eng Swee (“Dr
                    Teo”), who testified that the skull fractures could have been caused by
                    five impacts or more. Similar observations were made by the Trial Judge.
                    However, during the hearing before us, counsel for the Respondent sought to
                    persuade us that those observations were not conclusive of the number of strikes
                    that the Respondent dealt, as it could not be said for certain that all five
                    impacts (or more) were caused by the Respondent, <em>ie</em>, they could have been caused by other forces, such as a fall.
                    As a result, counsel for the Respondent submitted that the benefit of doubt
                    should be given to the Respondent and it should not be readily assumed that the
                    Respondent had rained <em>multiple strikes</em> upon the
                    deceased’s head as submitted by the Prosecution. Between the two
                    positions, counsel for the Respondent was trying to show that the Respondent had
                    only struck the deceased twice or at the most thrice before running away, while
                    the Prosecution was trying to show that the Respondent had mercilessly dealt
                    blow after blow on the deceased even after he had fallen onto the
                ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In our opinion, the exact number of blows that
                    the Respondent inflicted on the deceased and the manner in which they were
                    carried out while certainly relevant to our inquiry are not necessarily
                    decisive. As the Trial Judge and the CA (Conviction) did not have to (and thus
                    did not) conclusively decide on how many blows the Respondent had inflicted on
                    the deceased’s head in coming to their decisions, and neither did the
                    Re-sentencing Judge do so, we will first turn to the evidence surfaced during
                    the trial itself to better understand and reconstruct what exactly happened on
                    that fateful day (bearing in mind the very important point (see especially below
                    at [77] and [78]) that such reconstruction <em>cannot</em>
                    contradict (and, indeed, must be <em>consistent</em> with)
                    the findings of fact already made by the CA (Conviction)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We start with the observations made by Dr Teo
                    that a “severe force” would be required in order to cause
                    fragmentation of an intact skull. Commenting on the pattern of the fractures as
                    found on the skull of the deceased, Dr Teo identified <em>at
                        least</em> five “separate” groups of fractures which he
                    felt were due to separate impacts. However, he also qualified this by explaining
                    that “once the skull has been fractured, much less severe force is
                    required to cause further fracturing of the skull.” Therefore, Dr Teo
                    said that he could not <em>conclusively</em> rule out the
                    possibility that some fractures might have been caused by either a fall or the
                    belt buckle. He did, however, express the view that the fractures were
                    “unlikely to be due to the belt buckle.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We also note that Dr Teo had highlighted
                    certain “unusual” injuries on the deceased. These unusual injuries
                    were either “paired” or had “some patterning” to
                    them. Dr Teo later explained that the “paired” markings could be
                    attributable to the pattern on the belt buckle, which was the face of the skull
                    having two eyes and a nose which was slightly hooked. Critically, we further
                    note that one of these unusual injuries was on the right eyebrow, which
                    corresponded to one group of fractures on the skull of the deceased which Dr Teo
                    identified (the other injuries with similar markings were found not on the head
                    but on various other areas of the body of the deceased). Galing had also
                    admitted that after he had returned to the scene, he had struck the deceased (at
                    least) once before taking the deceased’s phone and running away.
                    Describing this, Galing mentioned that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At that time the deceased was sitting down and he wanted to get up. And as
                        he was about to get up, I hit him. After hitting him, I wanted to run away
                        but at that time I saw his handphone. When I saw his handphone, I picked up
                        his handphone and ran off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Galing however, asserted that he could not remember exactly
                        where he had struck the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We will now consider whether it is possible to
                    determine the number of blows landed by the Respondent on the deceased’s
                    head. Starting first with the objective medical evidence <em>alone</em>, it could be said that, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, the Respondent had landed at least five blows onto the
                    head of the deceased – thus the five separate groups of fractures
                    mentioned by Dr Teo. What raises doubt as to this <em>prima
                        facie</em> position appear to be two matters. First is the allegation
                    that the fall of the deceased onto the ground after the first blow by the
                    Respondent could be the cause of some fractures. Second is the fact that at some
                    later point Galing hit the deceased using his belt buckle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     On the first matter, it stands to reason that
                    if the fall could cause a group of fractures, it would mean that the first blow
                    by the Respondent onto the deceased’s head must have been of such a
                    tremendous force that it literally cracked the skull and weakened it so much so
                    that just a fall could cause a further set of fractures. Even then, on the
                    Respondent’s own evidence, he went on to deliver a second blow to the
                    deceased’s head. What this means, is that even if we are to give the
                    Respondent the benefit of the doubt and find that certain groups of fractures
                    were attributable to a fall, in line with the severity of his first blow, it
                    must follow that the second blow of the Respondent would also have been of
                    considerable force. There was nothing to indicate that he had suddenly turned
                    merciful as to lessen the force of the subsequent blow. Pausing here for a
                    moment, and assuming that the Respondent had only inflicted two blows, the
                    picture which emerges before us is a person, while his intention was only to rob
                    the deceased, did not care at all whether his severe blows to the deceased would
                    cause him to die. This is even more apparent considering that the Respondent had
                    chosen to hit the deceased in an extremely vulnerable region <em>ie</em> his head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Thereafter, we have the evidence of Galing
                    where he said that he struck the deceased with his belt buckle. It is true that
                    Dr Teo had opined that, once the skull is fractured, a much less severe force is
                    required to cause further fracturing, and therefore, a strike from the belt
                    buckle, after the Respondent had delivered the first severe blow, could very
                    well have caused further fracturing, although he also had some reservations,
                    stating that this would be unlikely (see [64] above). Galing testified that he
                    had struck the deceased only <em>once</em> when he returned
                    to the scene where the deceased and the Respondent were. Assuming that Galing
                    was not involved in a struggle with the Respondent earlier, Galing’s
                    position cannot be true as there were multiple injuries with a pattern (see [65]
                    above) on other parts of the deceased body (not the head) with only one injury
                    with a pattern appearing on the right eyebrow of the Deceased. Taking these into
                    consideration, all it means is that <em>one</em> set of
                    fractures could possibly be attributed to the belt buckle, and even then, we
                    hasten to add that Dr Teo had his reservations as to this possibility (the belt
                    buckle causing a set of fractures). The net result is that, at the very most,
                    one group of fractures would have been caused by the fall, and another group by
                    the belt buckle. That leaves three more group of fractures to account for,
                    leading us to draw the irresistible conclusion that the Respondent had struck
                    the deceased at least three times on the head, which was also the finding of the
                    CA (Conviction) when it held that that the Respondent had struck the deceased on
                    the head more than twice (see [56] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Apart from the medical evidence, the only
                    other evidence which suggests that the Respondent had struck the deceased
                    multiple times are the statements of Galing to the police. As observed above,
                    Galing had changed his evidence during oral testimony at the trial to state that
                    he had only seen the Respondent strike the deceased once (which is even contrary
                    to what the Respondent himself admitted).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We would only note that this claim of Galing
                    that the statements were recorded inaccurately was rejected by <em>both</em> the Trial Judge and the CA (Conviction). The Trial
                    Judge had the opportunity to observe Galing during his oral testimony and to
                    draw his conclusions from that, and there is no reason why this court at this
                    re-sentencing stage should refuse to accept that finding. There are obviously a
                    variety of reasons why Galing could have been motivated to change his story at
                    the trial to help the Respondent, and an exercise in speculation would be
                    futile, bearing in mind that even the Respondent admitted that he had struck the
                    deceased on the head twice. In the light of the totality of the evidence, we are
                    satisfied that the Respondent had struck the deceased head with the tree branch
                    with much force at least three times. We say “at least” because we
                    have borne in mind Dr Teo had opined that it was unlikely that the belt buckle
                    could have caused the fractures. More importantly, we have absolutely no doubt
                    that when the Respondent landed the three blows on the head of the deceased, he
                    did not care at all whether the blows would kill the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Did the Respondent act in a way which showed a blatant disregard for
                human life? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     We have focused thus far on the exact number
                    of blows the Respondent had inflicted on the head of the deceased, although that
                    is not the defining question that needs to be answered. The key question which
                    we must answer is – did the Respondent act in a manner which showed a
                    blatant disregard for human life? While, as we have stated above, that the
                    question as to the number of blows which the Respondent had landed on the head
                    of the deceased is not <em>decisive</em>, it remains very
                    relevant to the key question. The following considerations are critical to our
                    decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, we find that the Respondent
                        had approached the deceased from behind, and struck him without any warning.
                        Whether or not this was prefaced with a struggle, between Galing and the
                        deceased, is of little significance to the Respondent’s culpability.
                        After the first blow was inflicted which caused the Respondent to fall to
                        the ground, there was effectively no more struggle.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, after the deceased fell to the
                        ground after the first blow and then turned around to face upwards, the
                        Respondent struck him once more. It is not disputed that the Respondent was
                        not retaliating. In our judgment, we are of the view that the Respondent
                        continued to hit the deceased at the very least two more times, before
                        leaving the scene. When Galing returned to the scene after chasing Wu Jun he
                        hit the Deceased with his belt buckle.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_c"></a>(c)     In any case, even if the Respondent’s assertion
                        that he had only struck the deceased twice is to be believed and accepted,
                        then the force he exerted in the two blows must have been so great as to
                        cause fracturing of such severity and magnitude, so much so that a fall, or
                        a strike with Galing’s belt buckle, could have caused further
                        fracturing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In our judgment, and consistent with the
                    finding of CA (Conviction), the Respondent had struck the deceased on the head
                    not once, but at least three times altogether. Even if the Respondent did not
                    intend to hit the deceased on his head the first time when the Respondent
                    approached the deceased from the back (we would only add that we cannot see how
                    that could be the case since he approached the deceased stealthily from the back
                    and there was no evidence that the deceased had dodged), we cannot accept that,
                    after the deceased fell and then turned round facing upwards, the Respondent
                    likewise was unaware that he was going to hit the head of the deceased. Given
                    the manner in which the attack was carried out, this was not a case where the
                    Respondent had merely hoped to disable his victim in order to rob him of his
                    belongings. Neither was this a case where the injuries were sustained in the
                    course of a fight or a struggle. This was a case where even after the deceased
                    was no longer retaliating (after the first blow), the Respondent went on to
                    strike the deceased an additional number of times, completely unnecessary given
                    that his initial intention was merely to rob him. In light of the sheer savagery
                    and brutality exhibited by the Respondent, we are completely satisfied that the
                    Respondent exhibited a blatant disregard for human life in the way he attacked
                    the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other circumstances of the case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     At [40(c)] of his decision, the Re-sentencing
                    Judge observed that the Respondent was relatively young, being 24 years of age,
                    at the time of the offence. The Re-sentencing Judge also rightly observed that
                    the Respondent was not as young as the convicted person in <em>Fabian</em> (who was 18 years of age). In our opinion, the
                    Respondent’s age (at 24 and not 18 as the offender in <em>Fabian</em>) is at best a neutral factor, and does little to change
                    the gravity of the case. The Re-sentencing Judge had also observed (at [40(a)]
                    of his decision) that the Respondent’s choice and use of the piece of wood
                    was “opportunistic and improvisational”, citing the CA
                    (Conviction) Decision at [35(b)]. Likewise, we found this to be at best a
                    neutral factor, given the way and manner the attack was eventually carried out.
                    The fact that the choice of weapon happened to be opportunistic pales in
                    comparison with the savage and callous manner in which the Respondent had
                    wielded it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Comments on dissenting judgments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The difference in views between the majority
                    and the minority is a matter of fact and not of law. As a matter of law, there
                    is a concurrence in views on the test that is to be employed in determining when
                    the death penalty should be imposed. It is common ground, however, that the
                    disagreement is one of fact. Particularly, we note that the minority found that
                    there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the
                    Respondent had hit the deceased on the head at least three or more times, or
                    that the Respondent had hit the deceased with such huge force as to cause most
                    of the fractures in the deceased’s skull. Given this insufficiency, the
                    minority was of the opinion that therefore, the threshold of the test (<em>ie</em>, whether the Respondent had acted in a way which
                    exhibits viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life), had not been
                    crossed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In order to reach their conclusion, the
                    minority undertook an extensive review of the evidence that had surfaced during
                    the very first trial. That being so, we emphasise that since this appeal arises
                    from a re-sentencing proceeding pursuant to the PCAA, the first port of call
                    must be the CA (Conviction) Decision. The findings of fact made by that court
                        <em>should not</em> be <em>revisited</em> in the present proceedings. Indeed (and for the
                    avoidance of doubt), all the issues as well as concerns raised by the minority
                    were <em>also</em> raised by counsel during the hearing
                    before the CA (Conviction) <em>and</em> were <em>ruled upon</em> by that court. We wish to highlight that at
                    the hearing before CA (Conviction), Jabing’s counsel had submitted,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the following points:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>(a)     “…there was no way
                        that [Jabing] could have caused the 14 or so fractures which Dr Teo
                        testified about”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>(b)     “For the 14 fractures to happen dispersed over the
                        head of the deceased there must have been several strikes on the
                        deceased’s head and definitely more than
                    two”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_c"></a>(c)     “…there is a strong possibility that Galing did not only use
                        the belt buckle but also the piece of wood which Jabing had discarded when
                        fleeing the scene”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_d"></a>(d)     “…there is a doubt that it was [Jabing] who
                        caused those injuries which resulted in the death of the
                        deceased.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Admittedly, as that
                        court was dealing with the pre-amendment position, there was no reason for
                        it to assess the savagery (or otherwise) of the Respondent’s actions;
                        put simply, it was merely making its findings of <em>fact</em> based on the evidence and submissions raised by the
                        counsel concerned. Clearly, the CA (Conviction) had found that the
                        Respondent had inflicted <em>more than two blows</em>
                        on the head of the deceased. As the law then stood, there was no need for
                        the court to be more specific then. What is also clear is that the court did
                        not accept the Respondent’s counsel suggestion that Galing could also
                        have used the piece of wood discarded by the Respondent to hit the deceased,
                        because the court acquitted Galing of the murder charge and instead
                        convicted him of only the offence of robbery with hurt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     What <em>this</em> court
                    ought to be concerned about in the present proceeding is whether based on
                        <em>those</em> findings of fact, the discretion ought
                    (or ought not) to be exercised in favour of the Respondent under the (amended) s
                    302(2) brought about by the PCAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Viewed in this light, in this proceeding, this
                    court should only <em>supplement</em> the findings of the
                    CA (Conviction) with <em>further</em> findings of fact to
                    the extent – and <em>only</em> to the extent –
                    that the CA (Conviction) had been silent and/or ambiguous on matters that are
                    germane to the resolution of the present appeal. As stated above, the CA
                    (Conviction) had accepted Galing’s statements and found “that
                    Jabing struck the deceased <b><em>more than
                        twice</em></b><em>, and </em><b><em>with
                        considerable violence</em></b>” [emphasis added in italics and bold
                    italics]. We would reiterate that Galing’s attempt to question the
                    accuracy of his statements at trial was rejected by both the Trial Judge and the
                    CA (Conviction). Having scrutinised the evidence, the CA (Conviction) concluded
                    (at [27]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In light of all this evidence, as well as the fact that the severe
                        injuries found on the deceased were concentrated at the region of his head,
                        it is <b><em>clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Jabing
                            intended to, and did</em></b>, <em>inflict</em><b><em>multiple head injuries</em></b><em>on the deceased, and that such injuries were certainly
                            not accidental or unintentional</em>. [emphasis added in italics
                        and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     With the greatest respect, the minority have
                    embarked on <em>a total reconsideration of all the findings of
                        fact</em> made by the CA (Conviction); they have, in effect, <em>not only re-opened as well as questioned those findings but also
                        sought to reverse them</em>. Indeed, if the analysis in these
                    judgments is taken to its logical conclusion, there might be at least a strong
                    case for finding that the Respondent ought <em>not</em> to
                    have even been convicted under s 300(<em>c</em>) in the
                    first place. Even if we were to accept the position that it was unclear as to
                    how many times the Respondent had struck the head of the deceased, what is
                    vitally important to bear in mind is that what we have here was a <em>completely shattered skull</em>. Bearing in mind the fact
                    that the alleged intention of the Respondent and Galing was merely to <em>rob</em> the deceased, what the Respondent did underscores
                    the <em>savagery</em> of the attack which was characterised
                    by <em>needless violence that went well beyond the
                        pale</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Returning to our position, as we have
                    observed, at the very least, the Respondent had chosen to strike the deceased
                    with such immense force at an extremely vulnerable region, so much so that a
                    simple fall or a strike from a buckle could have led to further shattering. To
                    us, this alone, already shows the Respondent’s complete disregard of human
                    life. To say that the fall (after the first blow by the Respondent) and the hit
                    by Jabing on the deceased’s right eyebrow with the use of the buckle could
                    have caused further fractures and thus mitigated the viciousness of the attack
                    is, with respect, a non-plus to us. The evidence is clear – severe force,
                    from more than two blows, had caused the kind of fractures which were found on
                    the head of the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The result of the amendments to the mandatory
                    death penalty regime is that, in certain circumstances, it is the court who is
                    now the final arbiter of whether an offender is deserving of the ultimate
                    penalty. The punishment of death is an unusually severe punishment in its
                    finality and enormity. The irrevocability of this punishment demands that in the
                    exercise of this discretion, the court should be guided by clear and practicable
                    principles in order to prevent any form of capriciousness and
                    arbitrariness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     At the same time, we recognise that the nature
                    of the crime is such that it does not lend itself to a situation where the court
                    could lay down a set of specific objective factors which are determinative. By
                    its very nature, what would constitute a blatant disregard of human life would
                    be very fact-sensitive. The punishment of a crime must be proportionate to the
                    gravity of the crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In our judgment, the punishment of death will
                    be appropriate when the offender had committed the murder in a manner which
                    clearly demonstrates a blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life. In this
                    appeal, the Respondent had struck the deceased in a vulnerable region (the
                    head). We find (as did the CA (Conviction) in dismissing his appeal against
                    conviction) that the Respondent had struck at the deceased’s head at least
                    three times. Although it is impossible to reconstruct exactly what had occurred
                    on that fateful day, given the evidence before us, we are inclined to think that
                    the Respondent had struck the deceased more times than that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     While the possibility of additional injuries
                    being caused by another force cannot be <em>conclusively</em> ruled out (for example, by the belt buckle of
                    Galing or a fall), in our judgment, the medical evidence clearly shows that the
                    fatal blows are attributable to the Respondent. The sheer savagery and brutality
                    displayed by the Respondent shows that during the course of the attack, the
                    Respondent just simply could not care less as to whether the deceased would
                    survive although his intention at the time was only to rob. He did not stop
                    attacking the deceased even after the latter was incapacitated and was no more
                    in a position to respond after the first blow. His actions were utterly
                    vicious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In the result, we find that the Respondent had
                    shown a blatant disregard for human life. Therefore, we allow the
                    Prosecution’s appeal and impose the death penalty on the
                    Respondent.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     At the invitation of Woo Bih Li J, I am
                    delivering my judgment ahead of him. I have had the benefit of reading the
                    judgment of my learned colleagues, Chao Hick Tin JA, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA
                    and Chan Seng Onn J (“the Majority Judgment”). In the paragraphs
                    that follow, I have adopted the nomenclature in the Majority Judgment, save that
                    I refer to the Respondent as “Jabing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The key issue in this appeal is whether the
                    death penalty should be imposed on Jabing under s 302(2) of the PC. I
                    should state at the outset that I respectfully agree with the analysis in the
                    Majority Judgment of the law in relation to the imposition of the death penalty
                    on a charge under s 300(c), and punishable under s 302(2), of the PC. In
                    particular, I agree that the “rarest of rare” principle is not
                    appropriate for Singapore (see [43] above). I agree with the formulation of the
                    test set out in the Majority Judgment at [44] above, <em>ie</em>, it is a question of whether the offender’s acts are
                    “so grievous an affront to humanity and so abhorrent” that the
                    death penalty is the only adequate sentence. I also am further in complete
                    agreement that, in the context of the present case, capital punishment would be
                    appropriate where the offender had “acted in a way which exhibits
                    viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life” (see the Majority
                    Judgment at [45] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     As is usually the case in these matters, the
                    outcome of the appeal hinges on the findings of fact. It is solely in relation
                    to the findings of fact that I must respectfully depart from the Majority
                    Judgment. I now give the reasons for my dissent on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Prior to the enactment of the PCAA, all that
                    the Prosecution was required to prove in a trial on charge under s 300(<em>c</em>) was that the accused had intentionally inflicted the
                    injury on the deceased, which injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of
                    nature to cause death. It was neither necessary for the conviction nor the
                    sentence to prove any details of the acts of the accused beyond this. While
                    evidence of the accused’s intention to inflict the fatal injury would be
                    found in the manner in which he had attacked the deceased, in certain
                    circumstances it is possible for an accused to be convicted without evidence
                    providing a blow-by-blow account of the incident. The fact that such evidence is
                    not before the court is often not due to the fault of the Prosecution. Very
                    often, as was the situation in the present case, there are no witnesses
                    available to give this evidence. If there is evidence to prove all the elements
                    of the offence, the lack of a detailed account of the incident will not stand in
                    the way of a conviction under s 300(<em>c</em>). And once a
                    person is convicted under s 300(<em>c</em>) of the PC,
                    under the previous incarnation of s 302 of the PC, the only punishment that
                    could be imposed was the death penalty. However, with the amendment brought
                    about by the PCAA, the new s 302(2) of the PC gave the court the discretion
                    to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment (with or without caning). As a
                    result of this legislative change, the details of the attack on the deceased by
                    an accused person became crucial on the issue of sentence, even though it was
                    not at the time of the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The problem in this case lies with the fact
                    that we are now trying to reconstruct, from the evidence given under those
                    circumstances, the sequence of events in order to determine the extent of
                    Jabing’s role in causing the death of the deceased. However difficult the
                    task may be, it must be done on the basis of the criminal standard of proof,
                        <em>ie</em>, beyond a reasonable doubt. Where any
                    evidence is ambiguous, the benefit of the doubt must be given to Jabing. Some of
                    these ambiguities could have been resolved had the relevant witnesses been asked
                    questions at the trial from this point of view; but this was not done and we can
                    only look at the evidence at hand and make such findings of fact as we can based
                    on the criminal standard of proof. In my view this court is entitled to revisit
                    any findings of fact made in the CA (Conviction) decision in view of this
                    crucial difference in the nature of the inquiry pointed out in the preceding
                    paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I shall first examine the two key findings of
                    fact in the Majority Judgment upon which the majority of this court concluded
                    that Jabing had acted in blatant disregard for human life. These are (a) Jabing
                    had approached the deceased from behind without warning, and (b) Jabing had
                    struck the deceased in the head at least three times (as stated in [70] of the
                    Majority Judgment) and with such force as to cause most of the extensive
                    fractures found in the deceased’s skull. I intend to show that there is
                    insufficient evidence to find beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had caused
                    most of the skull fractures (either by multiple strikes or two strikes with huge
                    force). Following that, I shall set out the findings of fact which this court
                    can find to be established beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence before the
                    trial court, upon which the sentencing decision should be based. My conclusion
                    is that, based on this set of facts, it cannot be concluded that Jabing had
                    acted in blatant disregard of human life.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First key finding: Whether Jabing approached the deceased from behind
                without warning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     On this first question, in my opinion there is
                    sufficient evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had
                    approached the deceased from behind without warning and hit the deceased in the
                    head. There is clear and consistent evidence from the factual witnesses even
                    though the medical evidence is, at best, neutral on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Factual witnesses </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Jabing </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Jabing’s evidence is that he approached
                    the deceased from behind without warning and struck him in the
                head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     It was recorded in Jabing’s statement
                    dated 4 March 2008 that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like I have stated in my earlier statement, soon after Galing and I
                        crossed the road to the open field, I picked a wood which I found on the
                        ground. When I looked up, I saw a smaller built victim was running away and
                        I started to chase him. By then Galing had started to hit the other male
                        Chinese who is bigger built. I gave up the chase and turned around to help
                        Galing who was by then was struggling with the said male Chinese. <em>I came from behind and used the wood that I was holding on the
                            head of the bigger built male Chinese.</em> ... [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Jabing had also admitted at least three times

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Apart from whether there was a struggle
                    between the deceased and Galing, Jabing’s evidence on this point is
                    consistent with Galing’s evidence in his statements and during the trial.
                    I now turn to consider Galing’s evidence on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Galing </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It was recorded in Galing’s statements
                    that he saw Jabing approach the deceased from behind and hit him with the
                    wood:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... I then asked Jabing what we are going to do. Jabing replied that
                            we robbed the two male Chinese. I told Jabing not to do it. Jabing did
                            not reply and just <em>walked behind the two male
                                Chinese</em>. I then saw Jabing took a piece of wood near a
                            tree. <em>After a few steps, Jabing used the wood to hit
                                on the male Chinese who has a bigger built on his head</em>.

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... The said wood is about 2 feet long. Jabing carried it with his

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     To some extent, the evidence of Jabing and
                    Galing (<em>ie</em>, that Jabing approached the deceased
                    from behind) is consistent with Wu Jun’s account of the attack. Wu
                    Jun’s evidence would suggest that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_a"></a>(a)     Wu Jun was attacked by Galing using
                        the belt buckle from behind. This is based on Wu Jun’s evidence that
                        he was hit once by something hard at the <em>back</em>
                        of his head (near his left ear),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> which he thought was a chain,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and that
                        he saw his assailant with “a clenched <em>fist</em>” [emphasis added] and “raising his
                            <em>hand</em> as if he was going to attack

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_b"></a>(b)     The initial
                        strike to the deceased was by Jabing. This can be inferred from Wu

                        The logical conclusion, given that Jabing and Galing were the only two
                        assailants, was that Jabing was the one who struck the
                    deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_c"></a>(c)     Jabing

                        did not see any other person apart from his assailant (which was identified

                    saw Jabing approach the deceased from behind and hitting him in the head, his
                    account of the attack is consistent with the evidence of Galing and Jabing

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The evidence of Dr Teo Eng Swee (forensic
                    pathologist) and Dr Ho Chi Long (neurosurgeon) would suggest that the deceased
                    might not have suffered a <em>direct</em> blow to the back
                    of his head. Dr Teo’s evidence was that he could not rule out the
                    possibility that fracture (14) at the back of the head might have been caused by
                    a <em>fall</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, Dr Ho took the view
                    that fracture (14) could have been an <em>extension</em> of
                    the fractures on the left side of the skull.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    However, this may not necessarily be
                    inconsistent with the fact that Jabing had approached the deceased from behind
                    without warning. The deceased could well have turned his head to the side when
                    Jabing approached from the back such that Jabing’s initial strike landed
                    on the side instead of the back of the deceased’s head. Indeed, it is not
                    difficult to imagine that the deceased might have heard someone approaching from
                    behind and wanted to turn around to see who it was. It is also possible that the
                    initial strike by Jabing to the deceased’s head did not cause any
                    fractures. It should be noted that Dr Teo could not give evidence of the order
                    in which the injuries were sustained (except that fracture (8) might have
                    occurred after the other fractures).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, the medical
                    evidence neither proves nor dispels the proposition that Jabing approached the
                    deceased from behind without warning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of the evidence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    While the medical evidence does not show
                    that the deceased was struck in the back of the head, it may not necessarily be
                    inconsistent with the fact that Jabing had crept up behind the deceased without
                    warning and attacked him. More importantly, there is clear and consistent
                    evidence from all three key factual witnesses (<em>ie</em>,
                    Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun) that would support a finding beyond reasonable doubt
                    that Jabing had approached the deceased from behind without warning and hit him
                    on the head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second key finding: Whether Jabing hit the deceased on the head at
                least three times or with such huge force as to cause most of the
                fractures</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In my view, there is insufficient evidence
                    to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had hit the deceased on the
                    head at least three times, or that Jabing had hit the deceased with such huge
                    force as to cause most of the fractures in the deceased’s skull. The
                    evidence would, taken at the highest, show that Jabing had hit the deceased in
                    the head twice and caused the skull to fracture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I shall consider firstly, the evidence
                    relating to the number of blows <em>sustained</em> by the
                    deceased, and secondly, the evidence on the number of blows <em>inflicted</em> by Jabing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The number of blows sustained by the deceased </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    For the reasons that follow, I am of the
                    view that the evidence only supports a finding that deceased sustained two blows
                    to the head. This comes primarily from Jabing’s evidence (see [107]
                    below). The medical evidence does not establish beyond reasonable doubt the
                    exact number of strikes that the deceased sustained or if the deceased in fact
                    sustained more than two strikes to the head (see, in particular, [111] and [121]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Factual witnesses </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The evidence of Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun
                    would not support a finding of fact that the deceased sustained more than
                        <em>two</em> strikes to the head:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_a"></a>(a)     Wu Jun’s evidence suggests
                        that the deceased was struck but not necessarily on the head. This is
                        because Wu Jun only <em>heard</em> the deceased
                        groaning in pain shortly after he was assaulted by Galing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_b"></a>(b)     Jabing’s evidence, both in his statements and
                        during the trial, was that he had only hit the deceased <em>twice</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> While it was
                        recorded in Jabing’s statements that he saw Galing hit the deceased
                        with the belt buckle,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> he did
                        not mention the number of times. In one of his statements, Jabing was
                        recorded as having said that he was not sure how many times Galing hit the
                            deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> At trial, Jabing said that he did not see
                        Galing hit the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> On
                        Jabing’s evidence, then, the deceased would have only been hit in the
                        head twice.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_c"></a>(c)     Galing’s evidence suggests that the deceased sustained one or two
                        blows. Galing’s evidence was that he had only hit the deceased
                            <em>once either in the chest or
                            head</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> As for the
                        number of times Jabing hit the deceased, Galing changed his evidence during
                        the trial to say, consistently, that he only saw Jabing hit the deceased
                            <em>once</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Based on the evidence of Jabing, Galing and
                    Wu Jun, the deceased would have sustained only two blows to the
                head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Medical evidence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The key issue is whether the medical
                    evidence supports the finding that the deceased sustained at least five
                        <em>direct</em> strikes to the head. Neither Dr Teo nor
                    Dr Ho could state the exact number of blows sustained by the deceased, but
                    merely concluded that it would take “several blows” or a
                    “huge force”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Firstly, the medical evidence does not
                    support a finding that the skull fractures were caused by <em>five</em> impacts or more.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> A closer look at the Notes of Evidence would
                    show that Dr Teo had identified not only five but a total of <em>eight</em> points of impact:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the laceration above the
                        left eyebrow/forehead region and the fragmentation of the skull suggest
                        blunt force impact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, fractures (5) and (6) indicate an
                        impact on the right side of the skull.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, fractures (2), (3), (4) and (7) could be due to
                        one impact or more.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, fracture (8) could be due to a separate
                            impact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, fracture (1), which is a comminuted
                        fracture of the frontal bone above the right eye, is probably due to another
                            impact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Fracture (12) could have been a
                        continuation of fracture (1) as well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_f"></a>(f)     Sixth, fracture (9), which is a
                        V-shaped fracture, could be due to another impact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_g"></a>(g)     Seventh, fracture (14) could be due to another impact
                        (Dr Teo said he does not exclude that it might be due to a
                            fall).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_h"></a>(h)     Eighth, the fragmentation on the left side of
                        the skull (where the left-sided craniectomy was performed) could be due to
                        one or more impacts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> However, fractures (10), (11), (12)
                        and (13) at the base of the skull could have been “continuations of
                        the fractures” from the part of the skull where the craniectomies
                        were performed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    More importantly, however, Dr Teo ended that
                    discussion with an important caveat that did not appear to have been picked up
                    in any of the previous proceedings:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...based on the injuries, these are the possible impacts, <em>but I cannot say whether it is just one particular blow or
                            multiple blows</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Dr Teo also explained that “[o]ne
                    impact may cause multiple fractures but the impact would have to be of very
                    great force”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> To be fair, Dr Teo did say subsequently
                    during re-examination that, in his view, one blow with a blunt object would not
                    have caused all the fractures present in this case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless,
                    it should be noted that Dr Teo did not go on to say the number of blows that it
                    would have taken to cause the fractures. He certainly did not say specifically
                    that the deceased sustained five <em>direct</em> blows to
                    the head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Secondly, Dr Teo did not have the
                    opportunity to examine the entire skull of the deceased during autopsy as
                        <em>significant</em> parts of it had been removed
                    during the two craniectomies that were performed on the deceased. As a result of
                    the injuries caused to the head which led to cerebral oedema (<em>ie</em>, swelling of the brain), the deceased had to undergo
                    decompressive craniectomy twice. During the trial, Dr Teo’s evidence was
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>

                    that the part of the skull removed during the left-sided craniectomy was in
                    “multiple fragments” and that it would have required “very

<em>That I cannot say for sure but I

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Three observations can be made
                here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    First, Dr Ho’s opinion is that some of
                    the fractures on the back and front of the skull may not have been caused by
                        <em>direct</em> blows, but could have been an extension
                    of the fractures caused by blow(s) to the left side of the deceased skull where
                    the craniectomy was performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Second, Dr Teo considered that the fractures
                    to the deceased’s skull could have been caused by distinct blows, but he
                    arrived at the conclusion without having the opportunity to examine the
                    deceased’s skull in its entirety (see [113] above). Unfortunately, Dr Teo
                    was not asked if he agreed with Dr Ho’s opinion that the other fractures
                    could have been extensions from the fracture to the left side of the skull where
                    the craniectomy was performed. However, Dr Teo does not appear to disagree with
                    the possibility that certain fractures could have been extensions of the
                    fractures to the left side of the skull; in fact, he was of the view that
                    fractures (10), (11), (12) and (13) at the base of the skull (that is, the part
                    which is in contact with the bottom of the brain) could have been
                    “continuations of the fractures” from the part of the skull where
                    the craniectomy was performed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    For completeness, I should add that even
                    though Dr Ho suggested several times during the trial that the fractures would
                    require several blows,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> he could not be certain and eventually
                    acknowledged that he can only say that it was a “huge
                        force”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Like Dr Teo, he could not specify the
                    number of blows that would have been necessary in order to cause such
                    fractures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Third, it cannot be ruled out that some of
                    the fractures could have been caused by <em>indirect</em>
                    force, <em>eg</em>, the deceased falling and knocking his
                    head against the ground. Dr Teo does not rule out the possibility that at least
                    one of the fractures (<em>ie</em>, fracture (14), at the
                    back of the skull) might have been caused by a fall.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Dr Ho also makes the point that the fracture
                    to the right side of the skull (<em>ie</em>, fractures (5)
                    and (6), at the right side of the skull) could possibly have been caused by the
                    deceased knocking himself on the ground:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So would you say if there was any <em>direct force</em> applied to the right side of the
                            skull from what you saw?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now, from what I saw, I cannot be a hundred per
                            cent sure if there’s a direct force or an indirect force, but
                            there’s kind---there’s some kind of force, er, also directed
                            on the right side of the skull because I saw the---that there was also
                            scalp swelling on the right side too. <em>So he was
                                either someone who was hit and then fell down and knocked on the
                                other side or a force going through the right side. That we cannot
                                say for sure</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Even though Dr Ho subsequently testified
                    that it is “impossible just a simple fall can cause that severe
                    injury”, it was an answer in response to counsel’s question whether
                    the injuries suffered by the deceased could have been as a result of “a
                    fall or several falls”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> It should not be
                    understood to mean that Dr Ho is saying that <em>none</em>
                    of the fractures might have been caused by a fall.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of the evidence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    From the analysis above, it is clear that
                    the medical evidence does not support the finding of fact that the deceased
                    sustained at least five <em>direct</em> strikes to the
                    head. There is a possibility that some of the fractures were caused by indirect
                    force like a fall. There is also a possibility that some of the fractures were
                    extensions of the fractures on the left side of the skull. Significantly, Dr
                    Teo’s evidence was based on his assessment of the incomplete skull (due to
                    the craniectomies). In any event, neither Dr Teo nor Dr Ho was able to specify
                    the number of blows that would have been necessary to cause the skull fractures
                    sustained by the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    If it is accepted that there is insufficient
                    evidence to establish that the deceased has <em>sustained</em> more than two blows to the head, then it follows that
                    there cannot be a finding that Jabing had <em>inflicted</em> three or more blows to the deceased’s
                    head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    I now move on to the next point, <em>ie</em>, there is insufficient evidence to establish beyond
                    reasonable doubt that Jabing had inflicted more than two strikes to the
                    deceased’s head.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>*evidence changed during trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    It is apparent that the evidence of Jabing,
                    Galing and Wu Jun, without more, would only show that Jabing had, at best,
                    struck the deceased on his head <em>two</em> times. It
                    should be recalled that Wu Jun had only <em>heard</em> the
                    deceased groaning in pain ([107(a)] above), but this might not have been caused
                    by a blow to the head. Jabing had confessed to having struck the deceased in his
                    head twice and no more.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>
                    The only point of contention lies with Galing’s evidence. As discussed
                    earlier ([107(c)] above), Galing had changed his evidence during trial to say
                    that he only saw Jabing hit the deceased in the head <em>once</em>. The crucial question is whether it is safe to rely on
                    Galing’s statements to support the finding that Jabing had hit the
                    deceased multiple times in the head with the wood.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Weight to be placed on Galing’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    For the reasons that follow, I am of the
                    view that little weight should be placed on Galing’s statements in
                    relation to the number of times Galing saw Jabing hit the deceased in the
                    head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Co-accused’s statements </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    It is commonly accepted that the evidence of
                    a co-accused (like Galing) would have to be treated with caution as he may lie
                    or distort the truth to preserve his own interests. In Chin Tet Yung,
                    “Criminal Procedure Code 2010: Confessions and Statements by Accused
                    Persons Revisited” [2012] 24 SAcLJ 60 at para 53, the learned author
                    stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even if the statements were to be ruled admissible, the weight to be
                        attached to them is another matter. Judges have to give detailed reasons of
                        how they arrived at their findings of fact especially in criminal trials
                        where the accused may face the death sentence. In the case of statements by
                        accused persons, it may be thought that the probative value would be
                        especially high if the statement were truly voluntarily given. However, as
                        case law has repeatedly shown, <em>statements may contain
                            self-serving exculpatory accounts, as well as shifting of blame to
                            accomplices or co-accused.</em> There can be no hard and fast rule
                        about the weight to be attached in such cases – as Woo Bih Li J
                        pointed out in <em>Lee Chez Kee v PP</em> [[2008]
                        3 SLR(R) 447 at [294]] <em>there may be cases where no weight
                            or only minimal weight can be attached to statements where the accused
                            blamed others and exonerated himself</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Galing’s statements consistently and
                    unequivocally stated that he saw Jabing hit the deceased on the head multiple
                        times,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> while at the same time played down his
                    own role by saying that he only hit the deceased once in the “front part
                    of the body”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> It should be noted that Galing later admitted
                    during the trial that he might have hit the deceased once either in the chest
                        <em>or head</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Based on Galing’s statements and his
                    testimony in court alone, there is no way to ascertain if he did see Jabing hit
                    the deceased on the head multiple times. In fact, there is every reason to doubt
                    Galing’s version of facts in those statements given that they are
                    exculpatory in nature as he had every reason to play down his role. Unless it
                    can be shown that Galing’s evidence in court should not be accepted for
                    some reason, there is no basis to prefer Galing’s statements over his
                    testimony in court. This necessitates an examination into Galing’s change
                    of evidence during trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Galing’s volte-face during trial and his
                explanation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In the witness box, Galing retreated from
                    the position he took in the statements and explained at trial repeatedly (at
                    least eight times) and consistently that he only saw Jabing hit the deceased
                        once.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> It
                    should be noted that Galing’s volte-face during the trial is <em>not</em> favourable to him, since it could lead to the
                    inference that he was the one who inflicted the injuries suffered by the
                    deceased. Indeed, Galing had maintained during the trial that he only saw Jabing
                    hit the deceased once, very shortly after the Prosecution had suggested to him
                    that the most of the fractures must have been inflicted by Jabing if he had only
                    hit the deceased once.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> This would have alerted Galing to the
                    fact that his evidence on this point might not be advantageous to his case.
                    Despite this, Galing maintained throughout the trial that he only saw Jabing hit
                    the deceased on the head once.</p>

                            parts that have been read out to you, it is clearly stated by you that
                            you saw Jabing hit the deceased multiple times, multiple strikes. What

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    At first blush, there appears to be an
                    inconsistency – this was picked up by the Trial Judge:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is some---now based on what I can see, uncertainty whether he used
                        the word “continue” because at one level, I seem to hear him
                        and say “I didn’t use the word at all.” At another
                        level, looking at other parts of his evidence is, “I used it because
                        it was suggested to me.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    With the benefit of considering the entirety
                    of Galing’s evidence as set out above, I am of the view that there is no
                    real inconsistency. It seems that what Galing was trying to say was that he told
                    the officer that he saw Jabing hit the deceased once but later (for whatever
                    reason) accepted the officer’s suggestion that he saw Jabing hit the
                    deceased repeatedly, and only the latter was recorded in his
                statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    On this point, it should also be noted that
                    Galing’s counsel had confirmed that Galing would rely on the statements
                    without qualifications for his defence,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> and that the statements
                    were made voluntarily even though some parts may not have been properly
                        recorded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Cross-examination of recording officers and
                interpreter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    As a result of Galing’s change in
                    evidence, the recording officers and interpreter were recalled and
                    cross-examined on this point. Unfortunately, the cross-examination did not
                    reveal much. They merely testified that there was no suggestion made to Galing
                    on the number of times that Jabing had hit the deceased and that the statements
                    were accurately recorded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> Therefore, they do not assist in
                    determining if Galing was telling the truth in the statements or during the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Even if we accept that the statements were
                    properly recorded, it does not necessarily mean that full weight should be given
                    to the contents of the statements. It is possible that Galing told the officers
                    that he saw Jabing hit the deceased multiple times in the head even though that
                    may not be the truth. In fact, Galing would have every reason to lie in the
                    statements in order to exculpate himself, especially if, according to him, the
                    officers had made certain suggestions which were favourable to him.
                    Galing’s explanation for his change in evidence during the trial is not
                    incredible, and it follows that the change in evidence <em>per
                        se</em> is not sufficient basis to prefer Galing’s evidence in
                    the statements to his evidence in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    I move on to consider an alternative basis
                    that might explain why Galing’s evidence in the statements should be
                    preferred over his evidence in court, namely, the possibility of collusion
                    between Jabing and Galing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   No evidence of collusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Both Galing and Jabing had changed their
                    evidence during trial in favour of each other:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_143-p2_a"></a>(a)     Jabing said he did not see Galing
                        hit the deceased, even though it was recorded in his statements that he saw
                        Galing hit the deceased; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_143-p2_b"></a>(b)     Galing said he only saw Jabing hit the deceased once,
                        even though it was recorded in his statements that he saw Jabing hit the
                        deceased repeatedly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    However, there is nothing to suggest that
                    Jabing and Galing could possibly have agreed to change their evidence to help
                    exculpate each other. Indeed, the highly inconsistent versions of fact given by
                    Jabing and Galing, parts of which are detrimental to the other, would suggest
                    that they have not colluded in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Medical evidence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Dr Teo’s evidence on the likely causes
                    of the injuries, understood in light of the fact that Jabing had attacked the
                    deceased first, would suggest that the belt buckle might have caused some of the
                    fractures. This possibility creates a reasonable doubt on whether Jabing might
                    have actually caused most of the fractures sustained by the deceased on the head
                    (either by multiple strikes or two strikes of huge force).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    During the trial, Dr Teo was reluctant to
                    link any particular injury to the weapons used in this case. In relation to the
                    wood, Dr Teo said that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… this sort of object [ie the piece of wood], if used as a weapon
                        is capable of causing a fracture of the skull. <em>But there
                            is nothing---there’s no real specific injury, er, that I would say
                            that would match, er, for example, the surf---the texture---the rough
                            texture of this, er, piece of wood</em>. All---all I can really
                        say is that if this object is used as a weapon, it is capable of causing
                        bruising, abrasions, lacerations and a fracture of the kind that is seen in
                        this---in the deceased. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    When Dr Teo was asked if any of the injuries
                    or abrasions on the deceased’s body can be identified as being caused by
                    the belt buckle, he pointed out, among others, the two abrasions on the right
                    eyebrow of the deceased would appear to match the design of the belt
                        buckle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Nonetheless, this has to be taken in light
                    of the fact that Dr Teo had repeated over <em>eight
                        times</em> that he would caution against over-interpreting these
                        injuries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> Dr Teo
                    explained that this is because “ana sarca” (swelling caused by
                    retained fluid) and the healing process over the six days might have distorted
                    or change the shape and pattern of the injuries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, he
                    acknowledged the possibility that the patterned injuries might be a matter of
                        “coincidence”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> In fact, Dr Teo
                    acknowledged that he is “really speculating” on whether the belt
                    is the cause of the injuries over the right eyebrow/eyelid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    As between the belt buckle and the wood, Dr
                    Teo took the view that the wood was more likely to cause the fractures, but did
                    not rule out the belt buckle as a cause, especially if the skull was already
                        fractured:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The skull fracture, your Honour, would have been

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Significantly, there is some evidence to
                    suggest that Galing started hitting the deceased only <em>after</em> Jabing had hit the deceased. While this suggests that the
                    skull must have been fractured <em>before</em> Galing
                    attacked the deceased, there is very little evidence to show the extent of
                    damage that had been caused by Jabing. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence
                    on the number of times and the manner in which Galing attacked the deceased
                    (except the possible link to the fracture over the right eyebrow). There is no
                    reason to assume that Galing could only attack the deceased with the belt
                    buckle; he could, for instance, have slammed the deceased’s head against
                    the floor or kicked/stepped on the deceased’s head. I should also
                    highlight that Galing had admitted that he was the last person to have attacked
                    the deceased, not Jabing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In my opinion, Dr Teo’s evidence,
                    taken at its highest, would suggest that Jabing had hit the deceased in the head
                    first and caused the deceased’s skull to fracture. He does not say how
                    much damage was attributable to Jabing and Galing respectively. As mentioned
                    earlier ([122] above), the medical evidence also does not rule out the
                    possibility of a fall causing some of the fractures.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of the evidence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In my view, therefore, there is insufficient
                    evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had inflicted more
                    than two strikes to the deceased’s head. Besides the uncertainty as to the
                    number of blows sustained by the deceased ([124] above), there is also no clear
                    evidence, factual or medical, to support the finding that Jabing had hit the
                    deceased on the head at least three times or with such huge force as to cause
                    most of the fractures. The factual evidence (<em>ie</em>,
                    Jabing, Galing and Wu Jun) would, at best, suggest that there were two strikes
                    or more, and the medical evidence would only support a finding that Jabing had
                    hit the deceased first, and caused fractures in the skull (the extent of which
                    is unknown).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Accordingly, the evidence would suggest that
                    Jabing’s involvement is, with respect, less extensive than the finding in
                    the Majority Judgement at [67]–[70]. For convenience, the attribution is

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ancillary point: What happened after Jabing first struck the deceased
                but before Galing began to attack the deceased?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    As discussed earlier, the medical evidence
                    is unable to show the extent to which the injuries were caused by Jabing as
                    opposed to Galing. It would only show that Jabing had hit the deceased first and
                    caused the skull to fracture (to an unknown extent). However, the evidence of
                    Jabing and Galing on the sequence of events (as opposed to the number of
                    strikes) might shed some light on the severity of the injuries inflicted by
                    Jabing and Galing respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The evidence suggests that the deceased had
                    not fallen on his face after being first struck by Jabing, and might have been
                    able to stand up after that. This casts a doubt on whether Jabing had, in fact,
                    struck the deceased multiple times in the head or with such huge force that
                    would have caused most of the skull fractures.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Jabing’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Jabing testified during the trial that after
                    he hit the deceased on the head for the first time, the deceased “fell to
                    the ground”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> and the deceased’s face hit the ground
                        first.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Jabing claimed that the deceased
                    “turned his body around to face upwards” with his hands covering
                    his head and Jabing then hit the deceased “one more
                        time”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> When asked to elaborate,
                    Jabing’s evidence was that he “cannot remember” what the
                    deceased was doing before his second blow and “do not know” if the
                    deceased was bleeding from the head.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    It should also be noted that Jabing gave a
                    slightly different account in his statements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_a"></a>(a)     Statement dated 26 February
                            2008:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… I then swung the wood towards the head of the male Chinese. I
                            am not sure I swung it at the back or the front of his head. Upon being
                            struck by the wood, <em>he fell to the ground facing
                                up</em>. [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_b"></a>(b)     Statement dated
                        4 March 2008:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… I came from behind and used the wood that I was holding on
                            the head of the bigger built male Chinese. I am not sure whether I swung
                            it hard or not since I was drunk. <em>The single blow on
                                the head by me caused the said male Chinese to fall onto the ground

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    This casts doubts on whether the deceased
                    had actually fallen on his face after being struck by Jabing the first
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Galing’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   After Jabing’s first strike</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Galing testified during the trial that he
                    had only saw Jabing hit the deceased once, and it occurred at the start when
                    they first approached the deceased and Wu Jun. Galing also testified during
                    trial that the deceased did not fall face down after Jabing’s initial
                    strike; instead, he repeated at least three times that he saw the deceased
                    “moving forward” or “running forward” after being
                        struck.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> This was largely
                    consistent with his evidence in the statements, where he said that the deceased
                    “ran forward” after being hit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span>
                    Galing’s evidence on this point would suggest, to some extent, that
                    Jabing’s initial strike that was witnessed by Galing may not have been
                    with such huge force.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Before Galing’s first strike</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    After Jabing’s first strike, Galing
                    said he went after Wu Jun but as he could not catch up with Wu Jun, he decided

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Again, this would suggest, to some extent,
                    that Jabing might not have struck the deceased multiple times or that
                    Jabing’s strikes (whether witnessed by Galing or not) may not have been
                    with such huge force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    However, some caution must be exercised when
                    approaching Galing’s evidence on this point. First, Galing’s
                    evidence was slightly inconsistent on whether the deceased actually managed to
                    stand up or was just trying to stand up (contrast [159(a)] and
                    [159(b)]–[159(c)] above). When asked to elaborate, Galing clarified that
                    the deceased was able to stand up but he “was not able to say whether he
                    was standing steadily or not” even though they were only about 3.8 metres
                        apart.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> He also could not explain what the deceased
                    did which led him to think that the deceased wanted to attack him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> Second, one
                    might argue that Galing was trying to reduce his culpability by asserting that
                    the deceased was trying to attack him (such that it appears he acted in
                    retaliation when he hit the deceased). Nevertheless, it is doubtful if this
                    argument carries much weight as Galing could well have denied hitting the
                    deceased in the first place if he actually wanted to exculpate
                himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Medical evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    The medical evidence is more consistent with
                    Galing’s version, that is, the deceased did not fall forward and hit his
                    head, and might have been able to stand up even after Jabing’s
                    attack.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    There is evidence to suggest that the
                    deceased did not fall face down after the first strike. First, as highlighted
                    earlier at [101], Dr Teo and Dr Ho do not rule out the possibility that the
                    fracture at the back of the head might not have been due to a direct blow.
                    Second, and more importantly, Dr Teo took the view that fracture (1) at the
                    forehead region, a comminuted fracture, was unlikely to have been caused by a
                    simple fall.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Further, Dr Teo also rejected the suggestion
                    that the laceration and abrasion on the face might have been due to the deceased
                    falling face down.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> When taken together, it would suggest that
                    the deceased did not fall forward with his face first after being struck by
                    Jabing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    While some blood was found on the kerb near
                    where the deceased was lying, there is no evidence indicating that the deceased
                    had actually hit his forehead on the kerb when Jabing first hit the deceased on
                    the head. Dr Teo’s evidence on this point is pertinent:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">This fracture, your Honour, is comminuted. It is

                            If the forehead did hit the edge of a kerb, er, the edge of the kerb
                            might cause a linear abrasion on the forehead or even a cut or a
                            laceration of the skin. The---the only laceration on the forehead, er,
                            is the one above the left eyebrow. I think that the fracture number 1,
                            which is the comminuted fracture is unlikely to be due to just a simple
                            fall. And because there was described fragmentation to the left side of
                            the frontal bone, the forehead, which had been removed at the
                            craniectomy, I do not think that this fracture is due to just a simple

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    It should also be noted that Jabing’s
                    evidence at trial was that he is “not sure whether [the deceased’s]
                    head hit the kerb”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    For completeness, it should be added that
                    there was no clear explanation for the blood on the kerb. Wu Jun’s
                    evidence was that he found the deceased on the grass patch and not the kerb. The
                    paramedic who first responded also said that the deceased was lying in a supine
                    position with his head on the grass patch and not the kerb. Nonetheless, it does
                    not mean that the deceased must have hit his forehead on the kerb upon
                    Jabing’s first strike simply because there is no alternative explanation
                    based on the available evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Further, Dr Ho’s evidence was that a
                    person who suffered a severe blow to the head may not succumb

                    consistent with Galing’s version that the deceased did not fall after
                    Jabing’s initial strike, and might have been able to stand up even after
                    Jabing’s attack.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of the evidence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Jabing and Galing gave contradicting
                    accounts of what transpired immediately after the deceased was first hit by
                    Jabing. The medical evidence is more consistent with Galing’s account that
                    the deceased did not fall immediately after being struck by Jabing. It is also
                    consistent with Galing’s evidence that the deceased might have been able
                    to stand after Jabing’s attack.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    In my opinion, the fact that the deceased
                    did not fall face first after Jabing’s initial strike, and might have been
                    able to stand up even after Jabing’s attack would cast a reasonable doubt
                    on whether Jabing struck the deceased multiple times on his head and, more
                    importantly, the force he had used. One might argue that the court must be
                    cautious when assessing the weight that should be placed on the fact that the
                    deceased was able to stand up shortly after he was attacked by Jabing, as it may
                    not necessarily be an accurate indicator of the severity of the injuries caused
                    by Jabing. However, it must be noted that Dr Teo’s evidence on this point
                    ([167] above) must be considered in the proper context, that is, Dr Teo was
                    asked a hypothetical question (whether a person would succumb immediately to a
                    huge force to the head) to which he answered that there is a possibility. He was
                    not asked to comment specifically on the likelihood in the present case.
                    Moreover, Dr Teo only said that there was a possibility that a person struck by
                    a huge force at the head might not succumb immediately but “not all
                    cases”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings of fact that can be established beyond reasonable
                doubt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Taking into account the evidence, and
                    bearing in mind the discussions on the two key findings and the ancillary point
                    above, in my judgment, the findings of fact that can be established beyond
                    reasonable doubt are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_a"></a>(a)     Jabing followed the deceased and Wu
                        Jun with the intention of robbing them;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_b"></a>(b)     Jabing picked up a piece of wood when he was
                        approaching the deceased and Wu Jun;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_c"></a>(c)     Jabing and Galing approached the deceased and Wu Jun
                        from behind, and Jabing struck the deceased in the head without
                        warning;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_d"></a>(d)     At
                        around the same time, Galing struck Wu Jun from behind; Wu Jun ran and
                        Galing gave chase;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_e"></a>(e)     After the initial blow by Jabing, the deceased did not fall and hit
                        his forehead but moved forward;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_f"></a>(f)     Jabing hit the deceased again in the head at least once,
                        and the deceased’s skull was fractured;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_g"></a>(g)     Galing did not manage to catch Wu Jun, so he
                        turned back and walked towards the deceased; Jabing walked pass Galing and
                        headed towards the overhead bridge;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_h"></a>(h)     Galing found the deceased in a sitting position, trying
                        to stand up and he hit the deceased once or more; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_i"></a>(i)     Galing took the deceased’s
                        handphone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    While the key findings of fact have been
                    discussed above, it would be crucial to consider, as much as possible, the
                    sequence of events in its totality so as to fully appreciate the nature of the
                    attack on the deceased.</p>

                                he---as he came back where you were in-between the deceased and
                                Galing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Yes, I agree we crossed each other’s
                                path.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    There is, however, some doubt on how far
                    Galing actually went to chase after Wu Jun before turning back. Galing said that
                    he “chased him until the side of the road” (<em>ie</em>, Sims Way),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> but could not give an
                    estimate of the distance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> Earlier, Galing said it
                    was somewhere between the electric substation and Sims Way.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> Wu
                    Jun’s evidence was that Galing appeared to have the intention of chasing
                    him but he does not know if Galing did as he “did not turn around to
                        look”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    There is also some uncertainty as to why
                    Jabing left the deceased and started walking towards the overhead bridge. Jabing
                    never explained in his statements. Neither was Jabing questioned on this during
                    the trial. Galing said that it was because Wu Jun was coming back for him and
                    Jabing wanted to chase him away.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> However, Wu Jun
                    said went back only after he saw that “there was nobody
                        around”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> and Jabing denied seeing Wu Jun coming
                        back.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    On the evidence available, it can only be
                    concluded beyond reasonable doubt that Galing tried to chase after Wu Jun,
                    turned back and walked pass Jabing who was going towards the overhead
                    bridge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Factual finding 8: Galing found the deceased in a sitting position,
                trying to stand up and he hit the deceased once or more</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    This point has been addressed above at
                    [159]–[170].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Factual finding 9: Galing took the deceased’s
                handphone</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    It is undisputed that Galing was the one who
                    took the deceased’s handphone. Galing admitted that he took the
                    deceased’s handphone after hitting him,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> and Jabing said he was told by a friend that
                    Galing had taken a handphone.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    There is some doubt as to whether Galing
                    took the deceased’s handphone from the floor next to the deceased, or from
                    his waist pouch. During the trial, Galing contested the accuracy of his
                    statements (in which he stated that he took the handphone from the waist
                        pouch).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Like the earlier instance involving the
                    number of strikes he saw Jabing hit the deceased, Galing explained that he was
                    influenced by the officer’s suggestion when the statements were
                        recorded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> There is no corroborating evidence
                    apart from Wu Jun’s statement which stated that the deceased would usually
                    put his handphone in his waist pouch.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> It appears that Wu Jun did not say
                    specifically that the deceased kept his handphone in his waist pouch on the day
                    of the incident. In fact, no waist pouch was ever recovered (either from the
                    scene or Galing’s possession), and the waist pouch (if it existed) did not
                    form part of the exhibits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> The evidence of the IO,
                    SSI Zainal Abidin Ismail, was that he was “not aware” of the
                    waistpouch and had only requested to seize the deceased’s
                        clothes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    As such, the limited evidence available
                    would only support a finding that Galing took the deceased’s
                    handphone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    The two key findings that would point
                    towards the conclusion that Jabing had acted in blatant disregard for human life
                    are: first, Jabing approached the deceased from behind and hit him on the head,
                    and second, Jabing hit the deceased repeatedly or with such force as to cause
                    most of the fractures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    As discussed above, there is insufficient
                    evidence to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had caused most of the
                    fractures (either by multiple strikes or by two strikes with huge force). The
                    evidence available would, at best, prove beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had
                    hit the deceased twice and with such force as to cause the skull to fracture.
                    The question is whether this set of facts cross the threshold of the test
                    established at [45] of the Majority Judgment, <em>ie</em>,
                    whether Jabing had “acted in a way which exhibits such viciousness or a
                    blatant disregard for human life”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    The Majority Judgment had concluded that the
                    threshold was crossed based on a finding that Jabing had inflicted at least
                    three or more blows causing extensive fractures to the deceased’s skull. I
                    have attempted to demonstrate that a proper analysis of the evidence discloses
                    reasonable doubt on the validity of that finding and that the evidence could
                    only prove beyond reasonable doubt that Jabing had struck the deceased on the
                    head twice. There is also doubt as to whether those two blows were the cause of
                    most of the extensive injuries found in the skull, as opposed to causing it to
                    fracture and resulting in death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    Based on the evidence that I have shown to
                    be proven beyond reasonable doubt, I am of the view that the threshold is not
                    crossed. Jabing, along with Galing, had intended to rob the deceased and his
                    companion, Wu Jun. Jabing had approached the deceased from behind and struck him
                    with two wicked blows to the head with the intention, at the very minimum, to
                    incapacitate him. But he had stopped after that. It was not a case in which he
                    had repeatedly hit the deceased after he was down, which would justify the
                    conclusion that he had acted with viciousness and blatant disregard for human
                    life. I must therefore, with the greatest of respect, disagree with the decision
                    of the majority of this court to allow the appeal of the Public
                    Prosecutor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Author">
        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    I have had the benefit of reading the
                    judgments of my learned colleagues Chao Hick Tin JA, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA
                    and Chan Seng Onn J (“the Majority Judgment”) and of Lee Seiu Kin
                    J. I adopt the nomenclature in the Majority Judgment but I will refer to the
                    Respondent as “Jabing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    I agree with the principles set out in [44]
                    and [45] of the Majority Judgment as to when it would be appropriate to impose
                    the death penalty for an offence of murder where the conviction is made under s
                        300(<em>c</em>) of the PC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    However, like Lee J, I will respectfully
                    depart from the Majority Judgment on the imposition of the capital punishment. I
                    also agree with Lee J that this court is entitled to revisit any findings of
                    fact made in the CA (Conviction) decision in view of the difference in the
                    nature of the inquiry then and now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    The evidence is clear that Jabing attacked
                    the deceased from behind without warning. However, it is less clear how many
                    times Jabing hit the deceased with a piece of wood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    In so far as the factual non-medical
                    evidence is concerned, the most damaging of such evidence against Jabing was the
                    cautioned statement given by Galing dated 26 February 2008 where he said that,
                    “Jabing was too violent when hitting the Chinese man until he bled
                    profusely. I saw him hitting the Chinese man several times and his head cracked
                    open”. Galing’s cautioned statement was vivid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    I agree that Galing’s cautioned
                    statement had been correctly recorded as was an investigation statement of his
                    in which he said that, “ … I gave up the chase and turned back
                    towards Jabing who was hitting the other Chinese with the wood in his hands
                    repeatedly …”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    On the other hand, it must be remembered
                    that Galing did not repeat the allegation of repeated blows by Jabing with
                    violence when he gave oral testimony at trial. On the contrary, he said Jabing
                    hit the deceased once. It was Jabing himself who said at trial that he hit the
                    deceased twice. In my view, it is unsafe to place too much weight on
                    Galing’s statements which he did not repeat at trial. While these
                    statements might have been accurately recorded and his oral testimony might have
                    been an attempt to help Jabing, the statements might also have been
                    embellishments by Galing if he was initially trying to push the blame for the
                    deceased’s death onto Jabing. I cannot rule out the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    I come now to the medical evidence. Lee J
                    noted (see [110] above) that the forensic pathologist, Dr Teo Eng Swee, had
                    identified eight points of impact which resulted in many fractures. The Majority
                    Judgment said Dr Teo had identified at least five separate groups of fractures
                    which he felt were due to separate impacts. I note that what Dr Teo had said was
                    that the injuries “might be” due to separate impacts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span>
                    Furthermore, as Lee J noted, Dr Teo had also testified that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… these are the possible impacts, but I cannot say whether it is
                        just one particular blow or multiple blows.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Dr Teo also said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To cause a fracture of a intact skull, would require severe force. Once
                        the skull has fractured, the further fractures of the skull could occur with
                        less severe forces ….<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    There was also evidence that Galing himself
                    had hit the deceased with a belt buckle although it is not clear whether he did
                    so only once. As for the use of the belt buckle, Dr Teo said that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I do not think that this belt buckle by itself would be capable
                        of causing fragmented fractures of the skull or---or a severe head injury as
                        in the case of the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    He elaborated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… my opinion is that the---the piece of wood is---would be, er,
                        more likely to cause these fractures. I do not think this belt buckle would
                        be capable of causing these fractures. However, I--I had earlier mentioned
                        that once the skull has been fractured, much less severe force is required
                        to cause further fracturing of the skull. So while I do not definitively
                        rule out the belt buckle, I would state that I think it is unlikely to be
                        due to the belt buckle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    As regards the question whether a fall could
                    be the cause of the fractures, he did not think so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> However,
                    for one of the fractures, ie, fracture (14), he said this might be due to an
                    impact but he was not able to rule out that it was due to a fall.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    Therefore, Dr Teo’s evidence was that
                    there would be at least one hard blow with severe force which fractured the
                    skull. It was likely that that blow was caused by a piece of wood and not the
                    belt buckle. However, once the skull was fractured (whether by one or two or
                    more blows), it was not clear what caused the other fractures. In particular, it
                    was not clear whether the other fractures were caused by Jabing using the piece
                    of wood or Galing using the belt buckle or a combination of the two and perhaps
                    also a fall as well. Furthermore, Dr Teo could not say that there were
                    definitely five separate blows to the deceased’s head. I should mention
                    for clarification that Dr Teo had also explained that the fractures of the
                    deceased’s head were not in themselves the fatal injury. The fatal injury
                    was injury to the brain.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    In my view, the medical evidence does not
                    necessarily corroborate any suggestion that Jabing inflicted more than two blows
                    to the deceased’s head although I agree that Jabing was responsible for
                    fracturing the skull. Therefore, it is unclear just how many blows Jabing had
                    inflicted on the deceased’s head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    For the reasons stated in Lee J’s
                    Judgment, I am of the view that there is also a reasonable doubt whether
                    Jabing’s blows were all inflicted when the deceased was lying on the
                    ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    In the circumstances, and even though
                    Jabing’s blows would have been of considerable force, it is in my view
                    unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted in a way which
                    exhibited a blatant disregard for human life. I would therefore dismiss the
                    Prosecution’s appeal for capital punishment for Jabing.</p>
