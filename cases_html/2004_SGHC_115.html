<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 19 January 2004, I granted to the plaintiffs the relief sought by way of their <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ex parte</i> application for, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">inter alia</i>, a worldwide injunction in the form of the draft order attached to the application (“the injunction”). The first to fourth plaintiffs are institutional investors. They are associated with and managed by Oaktree Capital Management LLC (“Oaktree”). The fifth plaintiff is associated with The Goldman Sachs Group Inc, and is managed by Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC. Filed in support of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ex parte</i> application were four affidavits. Melissa Obegi is the Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel of Oaktree. She affirmed, on 14 January 2004, the principal supporting affidavit. Five volumes of exhibits were appended to her affidavit.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Mr Davinder Singh SC represents the plaintiffs. The defendants may be separated into two groups. The first group of defendants (“the majority defendants”) are: Burhan Uray (“D1”), Joseph Wong Kiia Tai (“D2”), Soejono Varinata (“D3”), H Sudradjat Djajapert Junda (“D4”), Hendrik Burhan (“D5”), Joseph Siswanto (“D6”), PT Daya Guna Samudera Tbk (“D7”), DGS International Finance Company BV (“D8”), WMP Trading Pte Ltd (“D11”), Betty Pai (alias Pai Sha) (“D12”), Borneo Jaya Pte Ltd (“D13”), Natura Holdings Pte Ltd (“D14”) and Handforth Profits Limited (“D15”). They are all represented by Straits Law Practice LLC. The second group of defendants, represented by Raju Velu &amp; Co, are Rosmini bte Sulong (“D9”) and Gary Chan Wei Long (“D10”).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> After the writ of summons and injunction were served, both groups of defendants filed separate applications to set aside the injunction and to strike out the writ of summons and statement of claim under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed). The majority defendants sought, in the alternative, a stay of the proceedings on the basis that Singapore is not an appropriate forum in which to determine the dispute. The applications were filed on 6 and 14 February 2004 respectively. The majority defendants’ application to set aside the order for service out of jurisdiction of the writ of summons was abandoned at the hearing. In support of their respective applications, the defendants filed numerous affidavits totalling 30 in number. The plaintiffs, on their part, filed 11 further affidavits. Mr Chelva Rajah SC was engaged as counsel to argue the applications on behalf of all the defendants.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The applications were first heard on 6 February 2004 in respect of the prayers for extension of time to file a list of assets and the defence. At the conclusion of the resumed hearing on 4 and 5 March 2004, I maintained the injunction, but ordered the plaintiffs to fortify their undertaking as to damages. I also refused to strike out or to stay the proceedings. The plaintiffs were ordered, nonetheless, to furnish security for the defendants’ costs up to the current stage of the proceedings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 9 March 2004, the defendants appealed against my decision. The subject matter of the appeal pertains to my refusal to set aside the injunction, strike out or stay proceedings in respect of which I now publish my reasons.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Brief overview of the plaintiffs’ case</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Broadly, this is a claim brought by the plaintiffs against D1 to D11 in which it is alleged that these defendants, or any two or more of them, conspired to and did defraud the plaintiffs of substantial sums of money by means of fraudulent misrepresentations by D1 to D11, or any two or more of them. The misrepresentations, made from time to time to investors such as the plaintiffs, were principally as to the true financial position of D7. The complaint is that the plaintiffs relied on the false financial information and were induced or otherwise influenced in their decision to purchase in the secondary market, on several occasions between 23 February 1998 and 16 May 2001 (“the relevant period”), bonds in the form of 10% guaranteed notes due 2007 (“the DGS Notes”).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The DGS Notes were issued by D8 sometime on or about 28 May 1997 (“the Offering”). Interest was payable by D8, bi-annually, on 1 June and 1 December each year, commencing 1 December 1997, at the rate of 10% per annum. The payment of the principal and interest under the DGS Notes was guaranteed by D7 under an indenture dated 28 May 1997 (“the Indenture”).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The DGS Notes were deposited in an electronic trading system form and they were actively marketed to institutional investors. The listing of the DGS Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange was designed to facilitate trading in the secondary market. It was, so the arguments run, within the contemplation of D7, D8 and the individuals acting on behalf of D7 that a secondary market in the DGS Notes would be created as a result of the Offering. All investors and potential investors in the secondary market would, in making an investment decision, rely on the financial or other documents released from time to time by D7 for its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) figures, income statements, balance sheets and so on. Moreover, the investors would rely on D7 as guarantor to pay the bi-annual coupon payments on the DGS Notes and the principal sum in the year 2007.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> To the plaintiffs, other representations made in the Offering circular dated 27 May 1997, Information Memorandum and financial information released by D7 at various times were:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> that the proceeds of the Offering of US$250m would be advanced by D8 to D7 to fund certain expansion plans of D7; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> a significant amount of the trade receivables were factored to banks in Indonesia with recourse upon default by the trade debtors.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> D8 and D7 defaulted on the coupon payments in June 2001. The plaintiffs conducted investigations and the fraud was then uncovered. The outcome of the investigations formed the basis of their pleaded case. The misrepresentations, as listed in the plaintiffs’ skeletal submissions, were:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB" style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: both">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The “third parties” continually represented in D7’s financials, from whom significant receivables were due, were actually related parties that were directly or indirectly owned or</span> <span lang="EN-GB">controlled by D1’s family.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The receivables that were supposedly due to D7 from some of these companies were fictitious transactions booked into their accounts to create an appearance of genuine commercial sales.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> D7 entered into factoring agreements with various Indonesian banks, under which the Djajanti Group was obliged to reimburse the banks should the customers of D7 fail to meet their obligations to pay the receivables as and when they became due. In 1998, D7 entered into a credit agreement for discounting trade receivables with PT Bank Mandiri with a facility of US$15m, renewable on 22 April 1999, bearing interest at Bank Indonesia bills discounting rate. Without the genuine trade receivables, the factoring agreements were entered into with the intention of causing D7 to increase its assumed liabilities. This, in turn, affected its ability to pay on the DGS Notes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The proceeds of the Offering were not utilised solely for the expansion of D7’s business operations but were also used for the purposes of funding other businesses of the Djajanti Group, namely funding the illegal logging activities in Liberia. Funds flowed from D14 and an entity known as Lemonade Profit to D7’s accounts. The funds were used to purchase heavy logging equipment for use by Oriental Timber Company (“OTC”). The proceeds of the logging activities were apparently channelled back to D14 and to D15.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Specifically, representations on trade receivables purportedly due from unrelated “third parties” were made and repeated in the financial information released by D7. They included D7’s 1997 annual reports, D7’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1998 and 1998 annual report. By way of illustration, the financial statements in D7’s Information Memorandum prepared in 1996 by D7 for the purposes of the public offering in Indonesia of 100m new shares of par value Rp500 each represented that significant trade receivables were due from unrelated “third parties”. These trade receivables were represented as arm’s length transactions on commercial terms. D7 was said to have falsely represented that:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The Company [D7] sells all of its export products to unrelated trading companies in Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Thailand which sell the products to end customers. All such sales are effected by way of back-to-back letters of credit, which in the past has enabled the Company to minimise the risk of bad debts arising in relation to the majority of its business. The Company typically allows its customers between 30 and 90 days’ credit. These trading companies sell the Company’s products to export customers in China, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Malaysia.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">D6 admitted that he was involved in the issue of the DGS Notes but denies the existence of a conspiracy as alleged or at all.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Besides the representations contained in financial information released by D7, oral representations were made on behalf of D7 at various meetings between agents for D7 and the plaintiffs’ agents. Representations on trade receivables purportedly due from unrelated “third parties” were repeated. It was represented to the plaintiffs that D7’s cash flow position and its EBITDA figures, based on its financial statements, were very good. For instance, D7’s representative in Jakarta, Tri Yantono, the Finance Director of D7, met Vina Sadiathi as agent of the fourth plaintiff, on or about 9 August 1999 to discuss the business operations of D7. In conversation, Tri Yantono, on behalf of D7, represented to Vina Sadiathi that usance letters of credit backed the receivables purportedly due to D7 and the average accounts receivables were around three months. It was also alleged that at all material times, D6 was actively representing the state of business of D7 to various representatives of the plaintiffs.</span></p>

In the Offering letter, D1 was named as the President Commissioner of D7. In D7’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1998, D1 was named as the President Commissioner, President Director and shareholder of D7 as at 26 December 1997.

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The serious allegations made against the defendants were strenuously denied. Mr Rajah started by carrying out an analysis of some of the plaintiffs’ evidence. But in interlocutory applications of this nature where the facts are contested, Mr Rajah rightly conceded that the matters complained of by the plaintiffs are matters for examination at trial. To go into the details here would not assist the court in disposing of the interlocutory applications. There are, with regard to the transactions, matters that will undoubtedly require examination before the court at the trial.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Given the approach of Mr Rajah to the applications before me, there is no need to repeat the defendants’ various responses to the disputed facts. So as not to be misunderstood, I ought to mention that I have noted the defendants’ criticism of the plaintiffs’ case and evidence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In overview submission, the defendants categorically denied any wrongdoing. Their contention was that D7 did not gain from misleading any secondary purchaser. D7 had already received funds from the primary issue. The price of the DGS Notes in the secondary market was of no interest to the majority defendants, as the secondary investors would not pay the defendants. More significantly, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs had not relied on any representations that were made but had gambled on the purchases of the DGS Notes in a falling market and lost with knowledge of the risk involved. In short, the plaintiffs’ losses were nothing more than an investment loss in the distressed debt market.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Order 18 rule 19 of the Rules of Court</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">21<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I shall first deal with the applications to strike out the writ of summons and statement of claim. The defendants asserted that the plaintiffs had not made out the cause of action on the facts as put forward. Three limbs of O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court were relied upon for the defendants’ principal contention. If that sole issue were to be affirmed, the defendants would equally succeed in their application to set aside the injunction since one of the pre-conditions to a grant of the injunction – a good arguable case – would not be satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">22<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> For the purposes of the striking out applications, the court had to assume that the allegations made in the pleaded case would be made good. Mr Rajah argued that even if the alleged primary facts could be made good, the conspiracy claim was bound to fail because the factual situations relied upon for the cause of action fall seriously short of meeting the threshold requirements of the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. I agree that a cause of action pleaded without support of material facts is defective and should be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, or as being frivolous and vexatious or an abuse of court.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">23<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> It is useful to repeat Mr Rajah’s contentions as set out in the defendants’ skeletal submissions.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In this application the Court is asked to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim because 3 essential ingredients of … unlawful act conspiracy are missing. They are:-</span></p>

In respect of OTC and its activities in Liberia, there is a reported bank document showing payment by Borneo Jaya Pte Ltd, on Uray’s order, of USD500,000 to an arms trafficking company. Uray was a defendant in the BMR Proceedings, accused of making fraudulent warranties under a share subscription agreement. As commissioner and/or director of DGS and chairman of the Djajanti Group, the clear and obvious inference is that Uray knew that the statements in the Offering Circular and the DGS accounts relied on by the Plaintiffs (as set out above) were false. Uray obviously meant to mislead the Plaintiffs and participated in the Conspiracy, with the intent to injure the Plaintiffs.</span></p>

Apart from that, he is also the manager of OTC and, together with Uray and Soejono, is associated with TF Enterprise. Joseph Wong knew and/or must have known that the receivables were fictitious and that they would be falsely reflected as genuine transactions in the DGS accounts relied on by the Plaintiffs (as described above) and/or Joseph Wong knew and/or must have known that the Offering was actually dishonestly designed to raise funds not only for the use of DGS but also for other businesses interests of the Djajanti Group, including OTC’s logging activities. Joseph Wong had knowledge of and participated in the Conspriacy with the intent to injure the Plaintiff.</span></p>

He is also an active director of the Djajanti Group of companies and its associated and/or related companies. He was also a defendant in the BMR Proceedings. Given the scale and extent of the fraudulent scheme, Soejono, as director of DGS and the other Djajanti companies, knew and/or must have known of and participated in the Conspiracy, with the intent to injure the Plaintiffs.</span></p>

He clearly has a very close business relationship with Uray. Sudradjat was also a defendant in the BMR Proceedings. He knew and/or must have known that the accounts of DGS, which the Plaintiffs relied on (as described above) were false and the obvious inference is that he had knowledge of and participated in the Conspiracy, with the intention of injuring the Plaintiffs.</span></p>

Further and/or alternatively, given her close business relationship and possibly family ties with Uray, Joseph Wong and Soejono, Rosmini Sulong knew and/or must have had knowledge of and participated in the Conspriacy to injure investors and potential investors of the DGS Guaranteed Notes, which included the Plaintiffs.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">25<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Rajah argued that the plaintiffs would have to plead and show, how and when each of the alleged conspirators subscribed to this intent, either by averring direct facts or by averring to facts which can reasonably support the inference of such an intent and not just some general intent. The pleadings and affidavit evidence before the court did not establish that the defendants were trying to cause damage to the plaintiffs in the sense that a “purpose to harm” was what actuated the defendants in so acting. The fact that the defendants realised that damage to the plaintiffs was an inevitable consequence of their action is plainly insufficient to satisfy this element of the tort. The plaintiffs, therefore, have no plausible basis for their allegation that the conspiracy was aimed at them or intended to injure them.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">26<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Counsel for the defendants relied on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Fatimi Pty Ltd v Bryant</i> <nobr>[2002] NSWSC 750</nobr> where Campbell J, in an analysis of the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means, said at [181]:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In this second sub-species of conspiracy, the policy judgment being made is that if A and B gang up with one of their objectives being to hurt C, and where they intend to achieve that objective by the use of unlawful means, an action for damages should likewise lie. The policy judgment is made that the additional element of agreement to use unlawful means to the effect the harm justifies lowering the bar from a “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">principal purpose to harm</i>” to a “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">purpose (not necessarily principal) to harm</i>” test. However, the “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">purpose to harm</i>” must still be what is actuating the defendants in acting. That the defendants realise that damage to the plaintiff is a likely, or indeed an inevitable, consequence of their action is not enough to satisfy this element of the tort. Rather, damage to the plaintiff must be one of the things which the defendants are trying to achieve.</span></p>

That, he said, is the correct test as opposed to the Australian jurisprudence put forward by the other side. Mr Rajah conceded that the Australian position appears to be somewhat different.

On that note, would the claimant have to plead and prove that the conspirators actually intended to injure the claimant and that such intention could not simply be inferred from the acts complained of?

In many contexts it will be necessary in order to prove intention to ask the court to infer the relevant intention from the primary facts. We can see no reason why there should be a special rule of evidence in this situation. On the contrary, in the case of most conspiracies to injure by tortious means it will be clear from the acts of the conspirators that they must have intended to injure the claimant.

In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Vickery v Taylor</i> (1910) 11 SR (NSW) 119, an agreement to raise the price of a company’s shares by making false statements was held not actionable by the court since there was no intention to injure the plaintiff as a member of the public, even though he suffered foreseeable loss as a consequence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">37<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The conspiracy alleged by the plaintiffs involved, amongst other things, falsification of accounts, fraudulently misrepresenting that D7 had substantial receivables from unrelated third parties including misapplication of company funds. It was pleaded in para 123(a) of the statement of claim that D1 to D11, or any two or more of them, conspired such that their fraudulent misrepresentations were made with the intention that they would be acted upon by investors or potential investors of the DGS Notes, which included the plaintiffs. The conspiracy was aimed at the plaintiffs as investors of the DGS Notes in the secondary market.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">38<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In this case, the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations amounted to unlawful means because they were made fraudulently to induce the plaintiffs to invest in the DGS Notes in circumstances where, but for the fraud, they would have invested the money elsewhere. Seemingly, where there is an intention to do an unlawful act, that on any view will do harm to the claimant, the intention to injure will most probably be inferred. The conspirators’ intention to benefit themselves in the knowledge that loss to the claimant will result from their unlawful act, will be treated also as an intention to harm the claimant. Ultimately, it is a matter of evidence for the court at trial to evaluate, on an objective basis, whether a particular result is substantially certain to follow an act and if the answer is in the affirmative, the defendant may be treated as having intended the result of that act.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The tort of deceit is not alleged against Demirel, notwithstanding that, on the pleaded facts, it would have been open to BGBI to claim that he was a joint tortfeasor in respect of the deceit alleged against his co-conspirators. That omission does not, however, undermine the foundations of the claim against him for unlawful means conspiracy, the essential elements of which seem to have been lost sight of in some of the authorities. That which engages liability is, as I see it, the combination to use unlawful means advertance to the risk of damage to the claimant in consequence of the unlawful conduct and damage to the claimant caused by such conduct. The proposition advanced <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">obiter</i> by Stewart Smith LJ in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV (Now Generale Bank Nederland NV) v Export Credit Guarantee Department</i> [1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 19 at p 32 and adopted and applied by Toulson J in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Yukong Line Ltd of Korea v Rendsburg Investments Corporation of Liberia and others (No 2) .</i>.. <nobr>[1998] 1 WLR 294</nobr> at p 314 … that the unlawful act relied upon must be actionable at the suit of the claimant appears to introduce a requirement which is conceptionally irrelevant.

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">42<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Rajah referred to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Michaels v Taylor Woodrow Developments Ltd</i> <nobr>[2001] Ch 493</nobr>. In that case, the claimant contended that any breach of a statute would constitute unlawful means sufficient to support an action for unlawful means conspiracy. Thus, breaches of a statute, which were not actionable as breaches of statutory duty, were nevertheless actionable if they formed the unlawful means in such a conspiracy. Laddie J disagreed with counsel. He held that not all wrongful or illegal acts would support an action for conspiracy by unlawful means. A major difference between a conspiracy to injure and a conspiracy by unlawful means was that, in the former, activities which were not actionable in their own right could be rendered actionable by virtue of their being performed in concert and where there was a predominant intention to injure. In the latter, the unlawful means had to be actionable in their own right against at least some of the alleged conspirators. Where, as in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Michaels v Taylor Woodrow</i>, the wrongful act consisted of the breach of a statute, it would only support an action for conspiracy by unlawful means <span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">if it was determined that the intention of the legislature was that such causes of action should be available to enforce the provisions of the legislation. That could not be said of the UK Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 under consideration by Laddie J. The unlawful means conspiracy was not made out because conspiracy to commit a breach of a statutory provision was not actionable as the</span> statutory provision itself did not give rise to a private right of civil action for breach of statutory duty.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">43<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Unlike <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Michaels v Taylor Woodrow,</i> the fraudulent misrepresentation, as alleged in this case, is capable of amounting to unlawfulness for the purposes of the tort of conspiracy. Liability for misrepresentation can be made out where the misrepresentation is made to a group to which the claimant belongs so that the claimant is one of those intended to be deceived (see <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited v RH Brown &amp; Company</i> (1972) 126 CLR 337). I have already mentioned that at the time of the Offering, it was in the contemplation of D7 and those behind D7 that a secondary market would be created. So the defendants intended, through the Offering circular, to inform and encourage purchasers in the secondary market, in addition to those investors who relied on the Offering circular, in making a decision to accept the allotment offer.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">44<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I did not regard as fanciful any argument that the facts of this case fall outside the general rule that an offer document is exhausted when the shares are issued. An exception to that rule is where the offer document contains material false statements and is intended to be acted on by a person other than the original allottees of the shares. That person, if deceived and injured, may maintain an action of deceit: see <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Halsbury’s Laws of England,</i> vol 7(1) (4th Ed, 1996 Reissue) at para 335; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Possfund Custodian Trustee Ltd v Diamond</i> [1996] 2 All ER 774; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Andrews v Mockford</i> <nobr>[1896] 1 QB 372</nobr>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong><em>No agreement or combination</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">45<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The defendants’ argument is that the statement of claim did not contain sufficient particulars of the alleged agreement, for instance, what the conspirators agreed to do and when the agreement was reached. Consequently, the defendants are prejudiced in that they will have difficulties meeting the plaintiffs’ case. The defendants must know what evidence ought to be prepared to meet the plaintiffs’ case. Furthermore, justice requires full compliance with the fundamental principle of pleadings that requires the plaintiffs to furnish utmost particulars so that the trial is conducted fairly, openly and, without surprises and, in the result, minimise costs.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">46<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> First, I was not persuaded that the statement of claim was so lacking in particulars of the alleged agreement. Reading para 222 with the earlier paragraphs such as paras 115, 117, 118, 123(a) and 124 of the statement of claim, as a matter of inference, the agreement must have taken place before the Offer document.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">47<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Second, it is self-evident that in conspiracy cases of this type, it would be remarkable for various conspirators to regulate the arrangements as between themselves in a formal manner. The realities were recognised by the English Court of Appeal in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Kuwait Oil Tanker</i> ([29] <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">supra</i>) which stated at [111] that a claimant is never required to show the existence of anything in the nature of an express agreement, whether formal or informal:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">It is sufficient if two or more persons combine with a common intention, or, in other words, that they deliberately combine, albeit tacitly, to achieve a common end.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Therefore, as is often the case, the agreement or combination is to be inferred from the evidence. The Court of Appeal found the following passage from the judgment in the criminal case of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">R v Siracusa</i> (1990) 90 Cr App R 340 at 349 to be of assistance in this regard, notwithstanding that the context was a criminal conspiracy:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">[T]he origins of all conspiracies are concealed and it is usually quite impossible to establish when or where the initial agreement was made, or when or where other conspirators were recruited. The very existence of the agreement can only be inferred from overt acts. Participation in a conspiracy is infinitely variable: it can be active or passive. If the majority shareholder and director of a company consents to the company being used for drug smuggling carried out in the company’s name by a fellow director and minority shareholder, he is guilty of conspiracy. Consent, that is agreement or adherence to the agreement, can be inferred if it is proved that he knew what was going on and the intention to participate in the furtherance of the criminal purpose is also established by his failure to stop the unlawful activity.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">48<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Similarly, Lai J in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Malaysian International Trading Corp Sdn Bhd v Interamerica Asia Pte Ltd</i> ([29] <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">supra</i>) commented at [59]:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Mitco rely on the overwhelming circumstantial evidence. Fraud cases of this type rarely leave behind a documentary trail, unless the conspirators whilst hatching the conspiracy were electronically recorded. But evidence of overt acts and omissions together are available to prove the fact of a conspiratorial combination or agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">49<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> A point taken by the defendants was the plaintiffs’ omission to plead knowledge of the Singapore defendants in respect of the issue of the DGS Notes and of the consequences of their issue. Thus, the overt acts allegedly committed by them could not possibly have been done pursuant to the conspiracy. That argument is unsound. As a matter of law, each party to the conspiracy may join in the execution thereof at any time and they are not required to know what the other conspirators have agreed to do. However, the parties to the conspiracy must be sufficiently aware of the surrounding circumstances and share the same object. A question in this case is how far each of the parties to the conspiracy was aware of the plan and then “joined in the execution” thereof.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">50<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> At first instance in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Kuwait Oil Tanker</i> case, Moore-Bick J put the matter in the following way (in a passage with which the Court of Appeal expressly approved at [133]):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Of course, as in any case of this kind, it is necessary to examine the evidence with care to see whether each defendant was involved in each fraudulent transaction, but once one reaches the conclusion that the defendants combined to steal from their employer by whatever means might present themselves, the question in relation to any particular scheme or enterprise in which one or some of them can be shown to have directly participated is whether that enterprise fell within the overall scope of their common design. If several people agree to enable each other to steal from their employer, lending their support in different ways at different times and taking different shares of the proceeds (or even each retaining for himself what he takes), each of them is a party to the agreement pursuant to which all the thefts take place. In those circumstances there is in my judgment no need for each to be fully aware of the circumstances of each theft in order for him to be liable as a conspirator provided that the theft in question falls within the scope of their agreement.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">His remarks are pertinent to the facts of this case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">51<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Some of the defendants were able to falsify the accounts of D7 by overstating its current assets to the extent that the account balances between D7 and the related third parties showed the latter as owing money to D7. The false accounting entries were mirrored in the respective accounts of D7 and the related third parties for the same period. Given the deliberate and calculated fraudulent accounting entries involving separate entities, there can arguably, at this interlocutory stage, be only one conclusion: that the directors of the Singapore Defaulting Companies were aware of the circumstances and conspired with the directors and senior management of D7 for the purpose of dishonestly portraying D7 as a good investment. The accounts did not give a true and fair view of the state of D7’s financial affairs as at the end of each relevant accounting period. Falsification of the accounts of D7 proceeded smoothly as the directors of the Singapore Defaulting Companies assisted D7 by, in turn, falsifying the accounting records of the Singapore Defaulting Companies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">52<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The plaintiffs rely on the relationships between D1 to D11 and the overt acts, as pleaded, to infer that an agreement with an intention to injure a class of persons, namely, investors and potential investors of D7, existed. The fraudulent misrepresentation was that fictitious receivables were genuine. There is apparently no evidence that fish or other related products were ever sold by D7 to any of the Singapore Defaulting Companies. The result is that the audited accounts did not present a true and fair view of the state of affairs of D7 and the Singapore Defaulting Companies. D11 is a $2 company. There is evidence that D11’s debt to D7 in 1998 was US$3m. Yet, D7 allowed D11 to further increase the debt to US$17m. There is also evidence that D5 signed some documents for the fictitious sale of fish or related products.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">56<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Overall, it cannot be asserted that the plaintiffs’ claim against the individual defendants (save for D12 to D15) is bereft of any possibility of success. They should not be prevented from proceeding with their case even though the potential for the defendants to present a strong defence exists (see <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tokai Maru</i> <nobr>[1998] 3 SLR 105</nobr>). The claim against the defendants involved allegations of conspiracy amongst the defendants. Those allegations could only be properly examined at trial. In the circumstances of the case, it was not appropriate to strike out the statement of claim and action as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, or as being frivolous and vexatious or an abuse of process.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Stay of proceedings</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">57<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> This brings me to the stay application filed on behalf of the majority defendants. Their counsel’s contention is that, assuming there was a conspiracy, whether the means used were unlawful as a matter of fact and law must be determined not in Singapore, but in Indonesia or New York.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">58<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The writ of summons has been served and jurisdiction conferred on the court to adjudicate on the dispute. The majority defendants subsequently abandoned their application to set aside the order for service out of jurisdiction of the writ of summons. If these defendants had continued to contest the jurisdiction of the Singapore court, the burden of proving that Singapore is the appropriate forum falls on the plaintiffs (see <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 253</nobr> at [16]). But they did not. A starting point in such a situation is that these defendants must be taken to have accepted that the Singapore court has jurisdiction and it is appropriate that the proceedings should be brought here. It falls on the majority defendants to show that either Indonesia or New York is the forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">59<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The emphasis of the first-stage test in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd (The Spiliada)</i> <nobr>[1987] AC 460</nobr> is upon “appropriate” rather than “convenient” because this is not simply a matter of practical convenience. The purpose is to identify the forum “with which the action has the most real and substantial connection” (see <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">per</i> Hunter JA in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Adhiguna Meranti</i> [1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 384 at 385). As Waung J pointed out in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Kapitan Shvetsov</i> [1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 199 at 204, what is required of the first-stage test is that the other forum must be distinctly more appropriate and not just marginally more appropriate, although it need not be the most appropriate forum.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">60<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I begin with New York as a more suitable forum. The defendants have identified, in the alternative, New York as the more appropriate forum to bring this case since the DGS Notes are subject to New York law and to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York courts. This proper law clause is contained in the Indenture. I agree with Mr Davinder Singh that the Indenture has no application or relevance to the present cause of action and subject matter of the unlawful means conspiracy claim for damages.

<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(q)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The Offering circular made it clear that execution of any judgments would have to be enforced by fresh proceedings in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">62<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In addition, Mr Rajah pointed out that the witnesses of facts in issue including staff from D7 and officers from D7’s auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, are Indonesians who will have to travel and be accommodated in Singapore. Interpreters may be required for the trial. All these expenses will be costly. Documentary evidence would have to be translated from Bahasa Indonesia to the English language.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">63<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The plaintiffs, on the other hand, pointed to factors connecting the proceedings to Singapore. They referred to D1’s attempts to downplay his links with Singapore. They argued that D1 is a permanent resident of Singapore and has as his address, 18 Margoliouth Road, Singapore. He spends at least two months in a year in Singapore. He controls D13, a company incorporated in Singapore, and various other Singapore companies. The Singapore companies, including the Singapore Defaulting Companies, played a critical role in the conspiracy and many are now in liquidation in Singapore. The conspiracy could not be committed without the Singapore companies. Without the fictitious receivables from the Singapore companies, D7 and the other conspirators could not have represented to the plaintiffs that D7 had assets.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">64<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The plaintiffs’ allegation is that the defendants, or those who were in a position to do so assisted by others, arranged for the true nature of the fictitious sales to be concealed from the plaintiffs and D7’s auditors by a series of sham accounting transactions. This was a fraud that was probably orchestrated from Indonesia and Singapore that impacted on the plaintiffs from another jurisdiction. It cannot be said with any degree of certainty, that significant evidence relevant to the matters in issue will be located in Indonesia as compared to Singapore and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">vice versa</i>. At best, the location of evidence – witnesses of fact and documentary in kind – is a neutral factor. Whether the trial is in Singapore or Indonesia, the documents would have to be translated. This is yet another neutral point. I also did not find the argument as to compellability of witnesses persuasive for the same reason.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">65<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I observed that no evidence of Indonesian law, or Indonesian law being the applicable law of the tort, was before me. There is merit in the argument that the defendants, having not opposed the order for service out of jurisdiction of the writ of summons, have accepted and acknowledged that the claim falls within the ambit of O 11 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court. Several limbs of r 1(1) were relied upon and the relevant sub-rules for the purposes of the stay application are sub-rule (1)(f) and (p). The Singapore court, so having jurisdiction on that basis, is arguably the appropriate court for the trial of the action.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">66<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> It was not asserted that Indonesian law on this topic is different from Singapore law. Therefore, there was no basis for Mr Rajah saying that the defendants in Indonesia would incur significantly higher legal fees as they would have to obtain separate Indonesian law representation and opinion in respect of the legality or otherwise of representations made and acts and omissions in Indonesia.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">67<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> D9 and D10 did not apply to stay the proceedings. Nonetheless, they supported the majority defendants’ stay application. I cannot see how this stance would assist D9 and D10 and the majority defendants in the stay application. The action would continue against D9 and D10 even if a stay of the Singapore action were granted in favour of the majority defendants. As far as D9 and D10 are concerned, Singapore is the appropriate forum and they have filed their respective defences to the action. More importantly, the conspiracy claims against D9 and D10 are inextricably intertwined with the same conspiracy claims against D1 to D8 and D11 as the claims against both groups of defendants are founded on essentially the same misrepresentations. Thus, in the interest of avoiding duplicity of proceedings and the attendant risk of conflicting outcomes in different jurisdictions involving identical and interdependent issues, the desire to resolve the entire dispute in a single trial is a strong factor against a stay of the action. Added to that are other factors like the stage of the proceedings in Singapore against D9 and D10.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">68<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The various proceedings in Indonesia did not involve the same parties and issues that are being litigated here. Case 114 was brought by the plaintiffs in Indonesia for the appointment of public accountants to audit the accounts of D7. In Case 125, D7 sought to set aside the order made in Case 114. Case 406 was brought by the plaintiffs in Indonesia to set aside the sale of some vessels on the ground that the sale was a sham. Save for D3 and D7, the other defendants in that case were different. It is not unreasonable to view all the proceedings in Indonesia as a feature of modern commercial litigation necessary in order to enable the proceeds of fraud to be recovered. They were plainly different from the cause of action and issues that are being litigated in Singapore. There is no <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">lis alibi pendens</i> to speak of.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">69<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The first and fifth plaintiffs brought an action in New York against D7 and D8, in contract, to recover their interest in the DGS Notes. The action was dismissed on 14 April 2003 on the ground that the claimants were not registered holders of the DGS Notes. This New York action was founded on a different cause of action and the parties were not identical. Again, like the Indonesian actions, there is no <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">lis alibi pendens</i> to speak of.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">70<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In my judgment, the defendants have not discharged the burden that Indonesia or New York is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum for the trial of the action than Singapore. The application for a stay failed at this stage. It is thus not necessary to determine if a trial in Indonesia will deprive the plaintiffs of legitimate personal or juridical advantages, and if so, to balance the advantages of litigating in Singapore against the disadvantages of litigating in Indonesia, if Indonesia is the more appropriate forum than Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">71<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> For these reasons, I refused to stay the Singapore action.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Worldwide injunction</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">72<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I now turn to the defendants’ application to discharge the injunction. The attack was put in three ways. First, it is said that the plaintiffs have no good arguable case as the statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action in Singapore. This is no longer a live issue given my refusal to strike out the statement of claim and action. Second, it is argued that there was no risk of dissipation of assets. Third, it is argued that the plaintiffs were guilty of material non-disclosure such that the injunction should be discharged.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">73<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I turn first to the submission that no risk of dissipation was shown by the plaintiffs and all that the plaintiffs were able to muster was a mere possibility or an unsupported fear. It is trite law that an appropriate case of risk of dissipation is made out, evidentially, where there is a good arguable case of fraud, as was the case here, of unlawful means conspiracy (see Steven Gee, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Mareva Injunctions and Anton Piller Relief</i> (4th Ed, 1998) at 198).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">74<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I come to the third ground of Mr Rajah’s attack, that is to say, material non-disclosure. Mr Rajah complained of three specific matters. They were:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> failure to disclose the discharge of the BMR Mareva injunction;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> failure to bring to the court’s attention s 11.6 of the Indenture which would have afforded possible defences to D3, and on the plaintiffs’ pleadings, to D1, D2, D4 and D5; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 0pt 0.5in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> that D12 sold her Sovereign Apartment (see [80] <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">infra</i>) despite the Mareva injunction in the BMR proceedings.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">75<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> By way of explanation, arbitration proceedings were brought against D7’s holding company, BMR, for fraudulent breach of warranties arising out of an equity investment of about US$70m in BMR pursuant to a share subscription agreement entered between the claimants and various parties associated with the Djajanti Group. Many of the defendants in the BMR proceedings are also defendants in these proceedings. They are D1 to D4, D11 and D12. The claimants there obtained, on 25 October 2001, an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ex parte</i> injunction against D1 to D4 including D11 and D12, D13 and D14. The injunction in the BMR proceedings was upheld after an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">inter partes</i> hearing, save for the injunction against D12, D13 and D14 which was discharged on 29 November 2001.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">76<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> I did not think that any of the complaints were material. They were entirely irrelevant to my considerations in granting relief. In the context of this case, where there are multiple allegations of false statements and accounts, the discharge of the BMR injunction is not a factor that would compel me to discharge the Mareva injunction on the ground of non-disclosure.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">77<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> In any event, Mr Davinder Singh had explained that the BMR plaintiffs had given confidential information to the court, which would have subjected them to certain undertakings not to disclose that information. The undertakings would extend to information obtained from a third party as a result of the injunction. Consequently, the plaintiffs had little information then about what was said in the BMR proceedings by the various parties. As can be seen from the plaintiffs’ written submissions, the lists of court documents not caught by the undertakings, as advised by Rodyk &amp; Davidson, the solicitors for the BMR plaintiffs, were limited. None of the court documents identified would have suggested that the Mareva injunction against D12 to D14 had been discharged.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">78<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Mr Rajah raised s 11.6 as a possible defence without further elaboration. Mr Davinder Singh referred to the s 11.6 point as a red herring. He explained that the section prevented registered note holders from suing non-parties on the Indenture. The section would not bind the plaintiffs as they were not registered note holders. Similarly, non-parties could not rely on it. In any event, an exclusion clause like s 11.6 would be unenforceable if fraud was proved.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">79<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> D12 to D15 are joined as defendants to the proceedings as they are alleged to be the nominees of D1 to D11 or any one of them. They may be joined as defendants even though the plaintiffs have no cause of action against them if a good arguable case is shown that the nominee was holding assets belonging to D1 and any of the majority defendants. I was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the plaintiffs have made out the requisite arguable case against D12 to D15.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">80<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> D12 denied that she was the common law wife of D1. She was the registered owner of an apartment, #12-01, The Sovereign, 99 Meyer Road, Singapore 437920 until it was purportedly sold. D1 admitted that he partially funded the purchase of the apartment. The plaintiffs question the sale, as the circumstances of the sale were unusual. D12 sold the apartment shortly after the injunction against D12 in the BMR proceedings was lifted and completion of the sale took place within a week. D12 explained that her buyer had money to complete a quick sale. No explanation was given about the absence of conveyancing searches normally carried out. Those searches would not have been completed within a week. More importantly, the apartment was the address at which D15, a British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) company, operated. D15 operated a bank account in Singapore, which had been used to channel funds from one company to another. D15 is connected to D1 and his family and D12.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">81<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> D1 has admitted that D13 is one of his companies. D13 had made payment on D1’s order. The inference the plaintiffs seek to draw is that the funds of D13 are beneficially the property of D1 and his family.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">82<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> D14 is a BVI company. Substantial amounts of money were transferred from D14 to D7’s US dollar account at the Bank of Central Asia in Indonesia and the funds were used to purchase logging equipment for OTC. D3 is a shareholder and director of OTC which at one time operated significant logging activities in Liberia on behalf of the Djajanti Group. D14 was also involved in channelling funds to D15.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Result</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">83<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Accordingly, I dismissed the applications to strike out or stay the proceedings as well as to discharge the injunction. I ordered costs of the application to discharge the injunction to be in the cause. The plaintiffs were awarded the costs of the applications to strike out and stay the proceedings. Those costs were to be agreed, if not taxed.</span></p>
