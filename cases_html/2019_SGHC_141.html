<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> First affidavit of Ms A filed on 6 December 2017, paragraph 11.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The defendant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Singapore company which I shall call “the Parent Company”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendant lodged its notice of arbitration with the SIAC in October 2015. In it, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff owed it a total of US$36.4m being the sums due to the defendant on 106 unpaid invoices for goods sold and delivered and finance charges accruing on those invoices. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The plaintiff rejected the tribunal’s jurisdiction from the outset of the arbitration. The SIAC constituted the tribunal in April 2016 (in the circumstances which I set out at [249]–[255] below) and left it to the tribunal to determine whether it had jurisdiction. The plaintiff thereupon declined to participate any further in the arbitration. The tribunal held an evidential hearing in May 2017 in the plaintiff’s absence and issued its final award in July 2017. The tribunal’s award addressed both the plaintiff’s objection to jurisdiction as well as the merits of the defendant’s substantive claim against the plaintiff. The tribunal found in favour of the defendant on both aspects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The plaintiff’s primary argument before me is that the award should be set aside under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law because the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to determine the dispute between the parties. Jurisdiction is in issue because the contract in which the arbitration agreement is found is not a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. That original contract is, instead, one between the plaintiff and the Parent Company. The defendant claims both its substantive rights against the plaintiff and its right to resolve that claim by way of arbitration as the result of a series of subsequent assignments and novations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiff’s alternative argument is that the award should be set aside under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law. The plaintiff argues that, even if the tribunal had jurisdiction, the composition of the tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties. The crux of the plaintiff’s argument on this ground is that the tribunal constituted to determine the parties’ dispute comprised a sole arbitrator even though their arbitration agreement stipulates that it should comprise three arbitrators. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I shall deal with the plaintiff’s two grounds in turn. I begin with the issue of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The eight contracts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Determining the plaintiff’s challenge to jurisdiction involves an analysis of the parties’ complicated legal relationship. For present purposes, that relationship is set out in eight related contracts. Some of these contracts are bipartite, some are tripartite and one is between four parties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In brief, as a result of these contracts, at various times: (a) the defendant assumed the Parent Company’s rights and obligations to the plaintiff; (b) a third party (which I shall call “the Factor”) became entitled to receive payment for some of the defendant’s goods; and (c) a Russian corporation (which I shall refer to as the “Russian Corporation”) became obliged to make payment for some of the defendant’s goods. Establishing whether the tribunal has jurisdiction therefore involves tracing the parties’ substantive rights and obligations as well as the procedural right to commence arbitration against the plaintiff through this matrix of eight contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The following table enumerates each of these eight contracts, setting out the name by which I shall refer to it in this judgment, the date of each contract and the parties to each contract:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Agreement</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Date</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Distributor Agreement</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">24 December 2010</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The plaintiff</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Parent Company</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Transition Agreement</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">14 January 2013</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The defendant</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Parent Company</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Assignment and Novation Agreement</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">25 January 2013</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The plaintiff</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The defendant</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Parent Company</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">4</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Participation Agreement</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">2 October 2013</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The defendant</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Factor</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">5</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Gold Plan Agreement</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">15 November 2013</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The plaintiff</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Factor</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">6</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Debt Transfer Agreement</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">On or around 12 December 2014</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The plaintiff</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The defendant</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Russian Corporation</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">7</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Open Debt Agreement</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">On or around December 2014</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The plaintiff</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The defendant</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Factor</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Russian Corporation</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">8</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Buy Back Agreement </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">23 April 2015</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">The defendant</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">The Factor</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I now describe each of these eight contracts in more detail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">1. The Distributor Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In December 2010, the plaintiff and the Parent Company entered the Distributor Agreement.

This paramount question can be divided into the following subsidiary questions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Did the Assignment and Novation Agreement novate to the defendant the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the Parent Company in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Did the Participation Agreement assign to the Factor the arbitration agreement in relation to invoices purchased by the Factor, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Debt B?

The remaining questions concerns the tribunal’s jurisdiction over only certain categories of debt. The plaintiff accepts that, if it fails on the first question, it must succeed in establishing the tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction under each of the remaining questions in order to secure its objective in this application of setting aside the award in full.

This is a fairly lengthy clause which I have already set out in full (see [13] above).

Any award shall not be subject to appeal. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 To recap, the plaintiff argues that the defendant was not and never became a party to the Distributor Agreement. To this end, it submits that the Distributor Agreement expired on 26 December 2012, before the parties entered into the Assignment and Novation Agreement. This means that the Parent Company could not have transferred the arbitration agreement to the defendant under the Assignment and Novation Agreement because the entire Distributor Agreement had ceased to have contractual force before then. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The defendant rejects this and relies on the parties’ conduct to argue that the Distributor Agreement continued to have contractual force after 26 December 2012.

</div> The plaintiff relies on Attachment A to the Distributor Agreement, which defines both the “Term Start” and the “End Date” of the agreement. Notably, the “End Date” is stated to be 26 December 2011.

</div> The plaintiff also points to the clause beneath the defined start and end date of the agreement, which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unless either party notifies the other not less than one (1) month prior to the End Date, this Agreement shall continue after the End Date for a period of one (1) years [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Reading the clauses together, the plaintiff submits that the Distributor Agreement continued for a year after 26 December 2011 and then expired on 26 December 2012. Neither the plaintiff nor the Parent Company gave notice to the other to extend or terminate the Distributor Agreement. On that basis, the plaintiff argues that the Distributor Agreement expired on 26 December 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The defendant adopts a different interpretation of these provisions. The defendant submits that, in the absence of notice, the Distributor Agreement was extended automatically for <span class="font-italic">successive one-year periods</span>, and not just for a single year ending 26 December 2012.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s written submissions, paragraph 313.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The defendant’s case is therefore that the Distributor Agreement remained in force all the way until it gave notice to terminate the agreement on 8 September 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On this point, I accept the plaintiff’s submission and reject the defendant’s. The defendant’s argument that the Distributor Agreement contemplated successive renewals for additional one-year terms indefinitely is quite inconsistent with the parties’ express contractual provisions on the term of the agreement. The clause in Attachment A provides expressly that unless notice is given by either party, the agreement “shall continue after the <span class="font-italic">End Date</span> for a period of one (1) years [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]” [emphasis added]. The parties chose to define “End Date” in the Distributor Agreement expressly as “26 December 2011”. It is significant to me that the Distributor Agreement defines “End Date” as a specific date and not recursively by reference to the end of the current one-year extension effected by notice. That this clause comes just one line after the defined duration of the agreement also serves as an indicator that the reference to “End Date” in the following clause must refer to the fixed date stipulated in the Distributor Agreement. In my view, the Distributor Agreement provided that it would continue to have contractual effect after 26 December 2011 up to 26 December 2012, at which point it would expire unless the parties entered into a separate extension agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The defendant’s alternative argument is that the Distributor Agreement provided that it would continue to apply so long as the plaintiff continued ordering goods from the counterparty to that agreement and the counterparty continued supplying goods in response. For this argument, it relies on cl 24.4 of the agreement. Clause 24.4 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The Parent Company] may, in its sole discretion, authorize Distributor to perform certain activities under the Agreement after its termination or expiration. <span class="font-italic">Any such activities shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I reject this argument also. Clause 24.4, on a plain reading, means only that, if the plaintiff’s counterparty authorises the plaintiff to perform certain specific activities under the Distributor Agreement after it ceases to have contractual force, those specific activities will be governed by the terms of the Distributor Agreement <span class="font-italic">which are relevant</span> to those activities and the plaintiff is therefore obliged to carry out the authorised activities in the <span class="font-italic">manner</span> stipulated in the agreement. Clause 24.4 does not, on its face, provide that all the terms of the Distributor Agreement – comprising both rights and obligations vested in both the plaintiff and the counterparty – continue to have contractual force simply because the plaintiff has been authorised to perform those specific activities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Reading cl 24.4 in the context in which it appears in the Distributor Agreement supports my interpretation of it. Clause 24 of the Distributor Agreement carries the title “Term and Termination”. It sets out the circumstances in which the parties agreed that the Distributor Agreement will cease to have contractual force. Clause 24.1 deals with the duration of the agreement. Clause 24.2 provides that either party may terminate the agreement with three months’ prior notice. Clause 24.3 provides when a party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s breach. Clause 24.4 then appears. By its very phrasing, cl 24.4 is clearly premised on the Distributor Agreement having ceased to have contractual force. In that context, its intent is to permit the Parent Company to authorise the plaintiff to perform any residual activities necessary or desirable in order to bring the parties’ business relationship to an orderly end. Purchase of goods under the Distributor Agreement is not a residual activity but the core purpose of the agreement. The intent of cl 24.4 is not that the Distributor Agreement in its entirety should continue to have full contractual force indefinitely into the future. That would be wholly inconsistent with the premise on which cl 24.4 is based.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Accordingly, cl 24.4 does not form a basis for the defendant to argue that the Distributor Agreement as a whole continued to have contractual force after 26 December 2012. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Survival of cl 25.9</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The defendant’s alternative argument is that, in any event, the arbitration agreement in cl 25.9 survived the expiry of the Distributor Agreement on 26 December 2012. There are two facets to this argument. The defendant bases this argument on both the principle of separability of arbitration agreements

</div>
</div> Therefore, as a consequence of both the principle of separability and the parties’ own contract, cl 25.9 continued to have contractual force after 26 December 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82  The principle of separability means that the invalidity of a contract does not necessarily entail the invalidity of an arbitration agreement which is integrated into that contract. Lord Hoffmann, delivering the judgment of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corp v </span><span class="font-italic">Privalov</span> [2007] 4 All ER 951 said (at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The arbitration agreement must be treated as a ‘distinct agreement’ and can be void or voidable <span class="font-italic">only on the grounds which relate directly to the arbitration clause</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The principle of separability does not, however, mean that an integrated arbitration agreement can never cease to have contractual effect together with the contract into which it is integrated. As Steven Chong J (as he then was) noted in <span class="font-italic">BCY v BCZ</span> [2017] 3 SLR 357 at [61], separability does not insulate the arbitration agreement from the substantive contract for all purposes. The question is whether, in this case, it was the intention of the parties that the expiry of the Distributor Agreement should also bring the arbitration agreement between the parties to an end. The intention of the parties, as always, is to be ascertained objectively from the words interpreted by applying the contextual approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 It is generally presumed that the parties intend a dispute resolution clause to survive the substantive contract ceasing to have contractual force. That is because the fundamental purpose of a dispute resolution clause is to govern the resolution of disputes between the parties arising out of the contract. This was recently affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Nippon Catalyst Pte Ltd v PT Trans-Pacific Petrochemical </span><span class="font-italic">Indotama and another </span>[2018] SGHC 126 at [36], where Audrey Lim JC (as she then was) quoted with approval this statement of principle from Gary Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration, Vol I</span> (Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) at pp 888–889:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the parties’ intention will presumptively be that they do not intend to terminate their arbitration agreement, or to permit unilateral termination of that agreement, but rather to leave the arbitration agreement in place to resolve whatever disputes that may subsequently come to light concerning the past performance of their contract or the termination of that contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As a practical matter, commercial parties virtually never intend to terminate an arbitration agreement that they have concluded; they instead intend to terminate their underlying contract while leaving their agreed dispute resolution mechanism in place for any disputes that may in the future emerge from their contract while it was in effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This is not, of course, a legal presumption in the technical sense of the word. It simply reflects the fact that contractual disputes frequently manifest themselves only after the substantive contract has ceased to have contractual force between the parties. Indeed, it is very often that the parties’ dispute is precisely about whether the contract has in fact ceased to have contractual force.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 There are, in this case, no circumstances from which it can be suggested that the plaintiff and the Parent Company, as the parties to the Distributor Agreement, intended their arbitration agreement to cease to have contractual effect on 26 December 2012, when the Distributor Agreement expired. Indeed, that would be a wholly uncommercial interpretation to put upon cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement for the reasons I have already given. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Further, cl 25.3 of the Distributor Agreement is in fact express indication that the plaintiff and the Parent Company intended their arbitration agreement in cl 25.9 to survive the expiry of the contract. By including cl 25.3, the parties expressly agreed that certain clauses of the Distributor Agreement would continue to bind the parties even after the Distributor Agreement as a whole had ceased to have contractual effect. I agree with the defendant’s submission that the reference in cl 25.3 to terms “which by their nature” survive the termination of the contract captures an arbitration agreement such as cl 25.9. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Accordingly, I find that the arbitration agreement continued to have contractual force as between the plaintiff and the Parent Company when the Distributor Agreement expired on 26 December 2012. But I also find, for the reasons which follow, that the Distributor Agreement, or a substantive contract on terms identical to it, continued to have contractual force after the Distributor Agreement expired on 26 December 2012.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Implied contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The defendant submits that an implied contract on the same terms as the Distributor Agreement arose after 26 December 2012.

</div> a decision of the Outer House of the Scottish Court of Session, concerned a franchise agreement which commenced on 1 August 2003 and expired after a five-year term on 1 August 2008. The parties nevertheless continued as though the agreement had not expired, with the plaintiff providing its services to the defendant and invoicing the defendant for payment as before. Lord Glennie held that a reasonable detached observer, looking at the conduct of the parties after the agreement expired, would infer that the parties were continuing to do business, as far as possible, on the same terms as before. Insofar as the original contract provided for a fixed expiry date, however, Lord Glennie held that the observer would not conclude that the implied contract was to be for a further fixed period of five years but that it would continue only until one party terminated it upon reasonable notice to the other (at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 <span class="font-italic">SJD Group</span> was considered and approved by Males J, albeit in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, in the English High Court in the case of <span class="font-italic">PSG Franchising v Lydia Darby Ltd</span> [2012] EWHC 3707 (QB).

</div> the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendant’s employer, Andar Transport, for the latter to provide delivery services. The agreement was for a term of three years from 4 April 1990. It expired on 4 April 1993 without the plaintiff renewing the agreement. Nonetheless, the defendant on behalf of Andar continued to carry out weekly deliveries for the plaintiff and invoiced it accordingly. The Victorian Court of Appeal found the inference that the parties had proceeded as though they were bound by a single agreement on the same terms as the expired agreement to be a more compelling inference than the inference that they had entered into a series of individual implied agreements covering each subsequent delivery (at [61]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> The question whether an implied or tacit agreement to continue dealing on the same terms save that the agreement should be terminable on reasonable notice is to be inferred is, … an evidentiary or factual question. On the facts we have set out earlier we consider such an inference should be drawn here. The evidence … warrants the finding that <span class="font-italic">after 3 April 1993 the parties proceeded as though still governed by the terms of the original agreement (save that, since it had already expired, either could terminate the substitute arrangement on reasonable notice)</span>, rather than a finding that they impliedly agreed merely that Andar should collect and deliver the laundry and that Brambles should pay it a reasonable sum for that or a finding that the parties made a series of individual implied agreements … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiff attempts to distinguish these three cases on the grounds that in all those cases, it was the <span class="font-italic">original parties</span> to the agreement who continued to act as if the agreement remained in force after its expiry.

Tan Lee Meng J dismissed the plaintiff’s claim, noting that material terms of the alleged contract had not been agreed. The plaintiff’s scope of duties and remuneration also could not be implied from any previous course of dealing between the parties because there were insufficient dealings between them (at [14] and [18]). The plaintiff appears to be arguing, based on this case, that because there were no prior dealings between itself and the defendant, there is no basis to find that an implied contract arose on the terms of the Distributor Agreement – a contract to which the defendant was not even a party before it expired.

Similarly, the conduct of the plaintiff and the defendant after entering into the Assignment and Novation Agreement puts it beyond doubt that they considered themselves to be bound by a contract on the terms set out in the Distributor Agreement on and after 25 January 2013. The inference is even more compelling than that in <span class="font-italic">Bramble v Wail</span> because there was more than conduct in this case to evidence the parties’ intention. They not only carried on with the sale and purchase of goods and invoicing as normal, they expressly affirmed in words that they considered the Distributor Agreement to continue to bind them at various points in 2013 and 2014. I therefore find that there was an implied contract on identical terms as the Distributor Agreement that arose between the plaintiff and the Parent Company parties after 26 December 2012, which was then novated to the defendant on 25 January 2013 and which continued thereafter until the defendant terminate it by notice in September 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 A final point to consider is whether an arbitration agreement contained in an implied contract satisfies the requirement of being “in writing” under s 2A(3) of the IAA. Section 2A(4) of the IAA, however, states that an arbitration agreement is “in writing <span class="font-italic">if its content is recorded in any form</span>, whether or not the arbitration agreement or contract has been concluded orally, <span class="font-italic">by conduct</span> or by other means” [emphasis added]. In <span class="font-italic">AQZ v ARA</span> [2015] 2 SLR 972 at [119]–[120], Judith Prakash J (as she then was) held that the arbitration agreement in an oral contract satisfied the statutory requirement of writing because it was on terms identical to an arbitration agreement contained in an earlier written contract between the parties. The arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and defendant is, in all but the most formal or technical of senses, cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The defendant is therefore entitled to rely on the arbitration agreement in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement to found the tribunal’s jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Finally, the defendant relies on the same facts set out at [96]–[99] above to argue that the plaintiff represented to the defendant by conduct that the Distributor Agreement continued to have contractual force after 26 December 2012. The plaintiff is therefore estopped from asserting that the Distributor Agreement expired on 26 December 2012, and in particular, is estopped from denying the existence of the arbitration agreement.

Ang J went on to opine, at [71]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I find that it is more conceptually consistent for a recital in an agreement not by deed to be similarly capable of giving rise to an estoppel by convention, where the proposition in the recital was contemplated by the parties and intended to be an agreement between them. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 With respect, the reasoning at [71] of <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings</span> is not entirely clear. If the basis of estoppel by convention is that parties have acted on an assumed state of affairs that is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a legally binding term within their contract, then there would be no need for the requirement that the proposition in the recital was “intended to be an agreement” between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Nevertheless, nothing turns on the precise difference between contractual estoppel and estoppel by convention in this case. It makes no difference in the present case whether the statements confirming the continuation of the Distributor Agreement in the preamble to the Assignment and Novation Agreement and in the Debt Transfer Agreement are interpreted as being legally binding terms which both parties are precluded as a matter of contract from denying or as an <span class="font-italic">extrinsic</span> state of affairs which the defendant acted upon. Either characterisation leads to the conclusion that the plaintiff is estopped from denying that the Distributor Agreement’s terms continued to bind it after 26 December 2012. The defendant supplied goods to the plaintiff in 2013 and 2014 on the basis that the parties continued to be bound by the terms set out in the Distributor Agreement. The plaintiff accepted those goods. It would be unconscionable for the plaintiff to assert now, in a claim by the defendant on unpaid invoices for those goods, that such reliance was mistaken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Accordingly, I accept the defendant’s alternative argument that the plaintiff is estopped from denying the existence of the Distributor Agreement, and from denying that it is bound by the arbitration agreement contained in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Notice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Finally, the plaintiff argues that cl 1 of the Assignment and Novation Agreement itself mandates that notice must be given by the Parent Company to the plaintiff and defendant before the novation will be effective. Such notice, the plaintiff contends, was not given.

I say that because it expressly transferred both the Parent Company’s rights as well as its obligations to the defendant. That is no doubt the reason why it was drawn up and executed as a tripartite agreement. There is no general requirement for notice to be given to an obligor before an obligee whose rights arise by reason of a novation may take action to enforce those rights alone and in its own name. The issue of notice arises here only because of the express terms of cl 1 of the Assignment and Novation Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The defendant’s case is that the Parent Company did give the notice required by cl 1 of the Assignment and Novation Agreement.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We are writing further to our communication dated November 1, 2012, which announced the transition of certain operations from [the Parent Company] to [the defendant].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In accordance with the Assignment and Novation Agreement included in that communication, we are now able to confirm that the transition will occur on 14 January 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The attachment itself is titled: “on 14 Jan 2013 [the defendant] starts operations.pdf”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The chief difficulty with the defendant’s submission is that the 14 December 2012 email, and the alleged effective date of novation of 14 January 2013, came before the three parties executed the Assignment and Novation Agreement on 25 January 2013. This raises the question whether, as a matter of construction of the Assignment and Novation Agreement, the 14 December 2012 email is capable of being the contractual notice required by cl 1 of that agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Clause 1 does not require notice to be issued only after cl 1 acquires contractual effect.  The language of cl 1 is neutral on this point: “<span class="font-italic">as notified</span> by [the Parent Company] to [the plaintiff] and [the defendant] not less than thirty (30) days prior to such date”. I accept the defendant’s submission that the words “as notified” do not unequivocally suggest that notice is an event for the future (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> “as <span class="font-italic">will be </span>notified”). Nothing much can be discerned from it, and it does not preclude the possibility of a notice in the past (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> “as <span class="font-italic">already </span>notified”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Indeed, it is significant to me that the only legal significance of the notice is to fix the Effective Date. Clause 1 of the Assignment and Novation Agreement does not impose an obligation on the Parent Company to give notice. In other words, if the Parent Company never gave notice, it would not be in breach of the agreement.  All that would happen in that case is that the novation which the defendant had agreed to would simply not become effective.  That suggests to me that what is important is that the plaintiff should know the Effective Date, regardless of how and more importantly when that happens.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The factual circumstances make it clear that the notice being issued before the Assignment and Novation Agreement is of little contractual significance. These circumstances reveal how the parties would have seen the 14 December 2012 email and its attachment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The earliest indication to the Parent Company’s partners, including the plaintiff, of the impending novation came with an email on 19 November 2012 from the Parent Company.

</div> It was not explained why the plaintiff’s Assignment and Novation Agreement was executed only on 25 January 2013. I am prepared to infer that the intention of the Parent Company and the defendant was similarly to execute this agreement by 30 November 2012. The plaintiff would have been aware of the Parent Company’s and the defendant’s intention, as two of its officers were copied on the email. In light of this, all parties must be taken to have understood the 14 December 2012 email as the notice required under cl 1, even if there were reasons that prevented particular counterparties from executing the novation agreement with the Parent Company and the defendant before 30 November 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Accordingly, I find that the Parent Company did give notice of the Effective Date to the plaintiff by the email of 14 December 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I now deal with the issue of jurisdiction in relation to the three specific categories of debts.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The more difficult issue is where the right to arbitrate a dispute in relation to a particular debt resides after the defendant assigns that debt to the Factor. The plaintiff relies primarily on two English cases to advance its proposition that an assignment of a contractual right divests the assignor completely of any right to arbitrate a dispute in relation to that right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In <span class="font-italic">NBP Developments Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and anor v Buildko &amp; Sons Ltd</span> (1993) 66 BLR 120 (“<span class="font-italic">NBP Developments</span>”), the main contractor of a building development commenced an arbitration against its employer. Midway through the arbitration, the main contractor effected an absolute assignment of its rights against the employer to a third party. The third party informed the employer that it intended to pursue the arbitration, but took no further steps to join itself as a party to the arbitration. After the arbitration had been inactive for three years, the employer applied for a final injunction restraining the main contractor (who was still the sole claimant named in the arbitration) from continuing with the arbitration. The question which arose was whether the main contractor was entitled to pursue the arbitration even after the absolute assignment. The court held that the effect of the absolute assignment was that the main contractor no longer retained any right to arbitrate. The assignee had succeeded to the rights of the main contractor in the arbitration from the date of the assignment (at 131). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The next case on which the plaintiff relies is <span class="font-italic">Montedipe</span><span class="font-italic"> SpA v JTP-RO Jugotanker</span> <span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">The Jordan Nicolov)</span> [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 11 (“<span class="font-italic">The Jordan </span><span class="font-italic">Nicolov</span>”). In that case, a charterer referred a claim against a ship owner to arbitration. The ship owner put the charterer’s continued title to pursue the claim in issue by adducing evidence that the charterer had, after commencing the arbitration, assigned the claim to its insurer. The charterer failed to adduce any evidence to prove that it continued to have title to the claim. The tribunal upheld that the charterer’s claim on the merits of the dispute, but declined to make an award to that effect because the charterer had failed to discharge its burden of proving title to the claim. The charterer applied to the English High Court for an order remitting the award so that the tribunal could enter an award, based on its favourable findings of fact on the merits, in favour of <span class="font-italic">both </span>the charterer and the insurer. Hobhouse J declined to remit the award to allow the insurer to intervene. The tribunal’s award had to be in in favour of <span class="font-italic">either</span> the charterer (the assignor) <span class="font-italic">or</span> the insurer (the assignee) but could not be in favour of <span class="font-italic">both</span>. But the charterer had, by its failure to adduce evidence of title, left the tribunal in a position where it could not conclude which it should be. Hobhouse J stated (at 20):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… An award, or judgment, must correspond to a proved cause of action. It cannot be right to give an award or judgment to a person who has no cause of action against the respondent/defendant. … A joint award cannot be right since on any view there is no joint right in the plaintiffs – <span class="font-italic">only one or the other can be entitled to an award</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The defendant disagrees that the cases cited stand for the proposition advanced by the plaintiff.

</div> On the defendant’s case, while the effect of an assignment is to deprive an assignor of a substantive right (such as the right to a debt) and to convey it exclusively to the assignee, it does not follow that the assignment also deprives the assignor of the right to arbitrate a dispute over that right and passes it exclusively to the assignee.

</div> The defendant also bases this argument on its interpretation of the separability presumption: that because the arbitration agreement exists as a contract separate from the underlying contract into which it is integrated, an original party to an arbitration agreement is deprived of the right to arbitrate only if there is a clear expression of intent to achieve that result.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I reject the defendant’s submission. The right to arbitrate a dispute over a contractual right which has been assigned cannot be vested <span class="font-italic">simultaneously</span> in both the assignor and the assignee. The defendant cites no authority for this submission. The nature of an assignment is that it “extinguishes the legal cause of action of the assignor against the party liable so that the assignor cannot thereafter himself ask for an award against the party liable” (<span class="font-italic">The Jordan </span><span class="font-italic">Nicolov</span> at 15). Hobhouse J was very clear that as between the assignor and assignee, “<span class="font-italic">only one or the other</span> can be entitled to an award” [emphasis added]. Although <span class="font-italic">NBP Developments</span> was concerned, strictly speaking, only with the right of an assignor to <span class="font-italic">continue </span>an arbitration that was commenced before the assignment, Fox-Andrews J also noted that the assignor “had no right to sue in their own name”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The more subtle aspect of this argument is that an assignor of an arbitration agreement remains a <span class="font-italic">party</span> to the arbitration agreement and therefore the ground under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) is not satisfied. Although in <span class="font-italic">Rals</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> (at [52]–[53]), I held that an assignee of rights under a contract does not become a party to the contract (or to an arbitration agreement integrated into that contract) in the contractual sense, the question under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law is not only whether the parties have an arbitration agreement between them but must include the question of whether the defendant has standing to invoke the arbitration agreement in respect of a particular substantive right. By assigning to the Factor the right to receive payment under Debt B, the defendant also gave up the annexed right to arbitrate a dispute in relation to Debt B.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 As a final point, the defendant distinguishes the cases cited by the plaintiff on the basis that the defendant assigned only <span class="font-italic">one</span> of its rights under the Distributor Agreement to the Factor, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the right to receive payment under the purchased invoices. The defendant retained all of the other substantive rights which it had under the Distributor Agreement, to which the right to arbitrate under the integrated arbitration agreement still attached. As such, the defendant argues, there is still <span class="font-italic">an</span> arbitration agreement in existence between the parties.

</div>
</div> The defendant acknowledges that it would not have the right to commence an arbitration in relation to Debt B, but contends that this is an issue regarding the scope of the arbitration agreement to which both the plaintiff and the defendant are parties rather than its existence. It is therefore not a basis for setting aside the award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 There is some merit to this argument. The Distributor Agreement governs the overarching business relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. As a result, it confers rights on the defendant which are wholly unrelated to its right to payment under an invoice which it issues to the plaintiff within that overarching business relationship. These unrelated rights include, among others, a right to review the plaintiff’s records for compliance with the Distributor Agreement (cl 4); a right to require protection of its confidential information (cl 8); and a right to adjust prices or terminate the Distributor Agreement for non-payment by the plaintiff (cl 13). It cannot have been the parties’ intention that these rights should be assigned to the Factor together with the invoices. Those rights are relevant only to the defendant as against the plaintiff, in their capacity as supplier and distributor respectively, within the framework of the Distributor Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The parties obviously continued to be parties to the arbitration agreement in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement in relation to these unrelated substantive rights. The argument then that their arbitration agreement does not include the right to arbitrate disputes in relation to Debt B is indeed a question of scope. Unintuitive as this result may be, Singapore’s law of arbitration has clearly taken the position that the ground for setting aside under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Model Law deals with the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of an arbitration agreement while questions of <span class="font-italic">scope</span> are dealt with under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) (see <span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV</span> [2014] 1 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">Astro</span>”) at [152]–[158]; <span class="font-italic">Kingdom of Lesotho v </span><span class="font-italic">Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd and ors</span> [2019] 3 SLR 12 at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The plaintiff does not base the present application on the tribunal’s <span class="font-italic">excess</span> of jurisdiction under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii).

</div> For this reason alone, the defendant’s assignment of Debt B to the Factor should not affect the existence of an arbitration agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff within the meaning of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i). That is sufficient, in itself, to defeat the plaintiff’s application to set aside the award in relation to claims over Debt B on this ground.

The plaintiff’s case is that the defendant and the Factor, by entering into the Buy Back Agreement, merely set up an arrangement under which the defendant paid the plaintiff’s unpaid debt to the Factor in advance, thereby relieving the Factor of the credit risk. In consideration of that, the Factor undertook to continue to collect payments referable to that debt directly from the plaintiff and to remit them to the defendant, as and when collected.

That clause expressly obliged the defendant to repurchase unpaid invoices from the Factor.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 At the outset, there is a complication with the defendant’s argument. Clause 4.3.1 is not a general obligation for the defendant to repurchase unpaid debt from the Factor. Instead, cl 4.3.1 on its face provides that the defendant’s repurchase obligation arises only in the two specific situations set out in the clause: (a) if the cause of non-payment is a breach of the defendant’s representations and warranties; and (b) if the distributor disputes the debt and fails to pay it within 180 days. There is no suggestion by the defendant that it repurchased the debt under the Buy Back Agreement because either situation (a) or (b) had arisen. To that extent, the repurchase in this case was voluntary rather than obligatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I nevertheless accept the defendant’s submission and reject the plaintiff’s on the effect of the Buy Back Agreement. The legal effect of the Buy Back Agreement on the repurchased debt is a question of construing it as a contract. It is well-accepted that our courts apply the contextual approach to contractual construction (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 at [72]). In applying the contextual approach, extrinsic evidence of the circumstances leading to the execution of the Buy Back Agreement is admissible if the evidence is relevant, obvious and reasonably available to both parties (see <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span><span class="font-italic">(Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [125], [128]–[129]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The evidence shows that by the end of 2014, the Factor was trying to withdraw entirely from operations in Russia.

</div> A few days before entering into the Buy Back Agreement in April 2015, the Factor emailed the defendant a draft of the Buy Back Agreement together with a list of the invoices that made up the plaintiff’s unpaid debt of US$28.48m referred to in Recital (B) of the Buy Back Agreement.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In this context and from the perspective of the defendant and the Factor, the contractual purpose of the Buy Back Agreement was to give effect to the Factor’s complete withdrawal from operations in Russia. Although the Buy Back Agreement was entered into voluntarily rather than pursuant to an obligation under cl 4.3.1 of the Participation Agreement, the Factor’s decision to terminate its Russian business indicates to me an intention to sever entirely any legal link between the Factor and the defendant’s distributors. That could be achieved only by a repurchase of the debt in the true sense of the word, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> a legal assignment of the debt under which the Factor drops out completely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I therefore do not accept the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant’s payment to the Factor under the Buy Back Agreement was simply to transfer the credit risk associated with the unpaid debt from the Factor to the defendant, while leaving the Factor the owner of the debt. This would not have made any commercial sense when the Factor’s intention was to withdraw from Russian operations entirely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 That cl 3 of the Buy Back Agreement states that the Factor “will continue to collect payments (if any) from or on behalf of” the plaintiff is not, in my view, inconsistent with a legal assignment of the debt back to the defendant. The key word in cl 3 is “<span class="font-italic">collect</span>”. By its plain meaning, that word refers simply to the physical act of collecting money. That is reinforced by the words “if any” which follow. If the parties’ intention was that the Factor was to collect payments to which it had a continuing legal entitlement, the words “if any” would not appear there. Those words make clear that the purpose of cl 3 is to cater for a contingency: the contingency that the defendant’s distributors would continue to make payment to the Factor. Clause 3 is not inconsistent with the intention which I have found to convey ownership of the unpaid debt back to the defendant. That conveyance must, of necessity, have carried with it the associated right to commence arbitration in relation to that debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Accordingly, on a contextual construction of the Buy Back Agreement and taking into account the circumstances surrounding its execution, I find that it did have the effect of assigning the unpaid debt and the associated right to commence arbitration in respect of that debt back to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Form of assignment</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The plaintiff argues that it was not given notice of the assignment, as required for the assignment to be effective as a legal assignment by s 4(8) of the CLA. The plaintiff’s case is that, in the absence of notice, the defendant was merely an equitable assignee of the debts at best. And as an equitable assignee, the defendant had no right to commence arbitration in relation to the debt in its sole name, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> without the involvement of the Factor as its assignor.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I deal first with the contention that the assignment back to the defendant was not a legal assignment because of the failure to give notice of assignment. Section 4(8) of the CLA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any absolute assignment by writing under the hand of the assignor, not purporting to be by way of charge only, of any debt or other legal chose in action <span class="font-italic">of which express notice in writing has been given to the debtor, trustee or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or claim such debt or chose in action</span>, shall be and be deemed to have been effectual in law, subject to all equities which would have been entitled to priority over the right of the assignee under the law as it existed before 23rd July 1909, to pass and transfer the legal right to such debt or chose in action, from the date of such notice, and all legal and other remedies for the same, and the power to give a good discharge for the same, without the concurrence of the assignor. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The tribunal found that the defendant did give notice of assignment, at two points. It reasoned, at para 8.37 of the award:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It also seems plain that [the plaintiff] had notice of the repurchase, from … communication between [the plaintiff] and [the defendant] in June 2015 …, and subsequently as a result of the submissions made during this arbitration. If there was any doubt on the part of [the plaintiff] about the assignment, it has had the opportunity during the arbitration to contact [the Factor], to make inquiries; but it has not done so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The defendant relies on the same reasoning as the tribunal: notice of assignment was given to the plaintiff first in communications in June 2015 and second in the submissions in the arbitration. The defendant also relies on a letter from the Factor to the plaintiff dated 5 May 2017.

Directly below these words, the letter sets out a table of all invoices, and their amounts, that were outstanding from the plaintiff to the defendant as of 15 June 2015. The invoices date from 6 September 2014 until 23 April 2015.

</div> the court considered a letter which omitted to give the date of the assignment and which wrongly stated that notice of assignment had already been given. The court held that the letter was nevertheless a valid notice of assignment within the meaning of the English equivalent of s 4(8) of the CLA.

</div> Andrew Ang J held that statements of account sent by an assignee to a debtor setting out the assigned debts was valid notice of assignment under s 4(8) of the CLA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The defendant submitted that the statements of account issued between 15 January 2004 and 24 June 2004 did not constitute written notice since they made no mention of the purported assignment but merely reflected a progressive decrease in the quantum of the debt against payments received … This submission cannot stand in the face of the language of each [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] the statement of account, which clearly asserted a right by the issuer to repayment of the debt from the defendant or the actual buyer. <span class="font-italic">Each statement of account was an implicit record of the fact of assignment and plainly indicated to the defendant that by virtue of the assignment the plaintiff was entitled to receive the money</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 The statement of principle in <span class="font-italic">Lanxess</span> is directly applicable in the present case. It is immaterial that the email of 18 June 2015 and the Acknowledgement of Debt Letter contain no reference to the fact that the invoices listed in the letter have been assigned by the Factor back to the defendant. The email and the letter are an implicit record of the fact of assignment. It is sufficient for the letter to inform the plaintiff that the debts, identified by invoice numbers, were now owed to the defendant and ought to be paid to the defendant. There is no need for the notice to use the word “assignment”. There is no magic in the word.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The plaintiff’s last point of objection is that its representatives did not sign the Acknowledgement of Debt Letter. In an email to the defendant on 19 June 2015, the plaintiff replied that it needed to “compare all invoices and amounts” and asked for further details “[b]efore signing a balance”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 This argument is misconceived. Notice of assignment is a unilateral act. It does not require the debtor’s consent or acknowledgement to be valid. It matters not that the notice is framed as a letter from the debtor to the assignee. It need merely convey to the debtor the identity of the debtor’s new creditor in respect of the debt in question. The defendant gave this notice to the plaintiff on 18 June 2015. “If the debtor ignores such notice, he does so at his peril”: <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve</span> at [94]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In any event, the further details sought by the plaintiff on 19 June 2015 email pertained to compensation for previous year’s losses and other rebates. The plaintiff raised no question about the ownership of the debt.  I find that the plaintiff had notice, at the latest by 18 June 2015 and by reason of the email of that date and its attachment, that it was to make payment of this debt to the defendant and not to the Factor. The plaintiff’s refusal to sign the Acknowledgment of Debt Letter does not detract from this finding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In light of my finding above, it is not necessary to consider whether the submissions in the arbitration, or the Factor’s letter of 5 May 2017, constitute valid notice of assignment. It is also not necessary to decide whether the rule that an equitable assignee must join the assignor in a claim is one that goes to the equitable assignee’s <span class="font-italic">right</span> to arbitrate, or is merely a matter of procedure. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Points specific to Debt 1B</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The plaintiff singles out invoices C3 to C6, which are part of Debt 1B, for special treatment. The plaintiff advances two additional reasons for arguing that the defendant had no cause of action in respect of these four debts when it commenced arbitration on 1 October 2015. First, the plaintiff contends that these debts had already been extinguished before October 2015.

It is apparent that the sole arbitrator appreciated this point as well. He therefore addressed the question of whether these debts had already been paid in his analysis of the plaintiff’s jurisdictional objections.

Ultimately, the credit notes are a matter between the defendant and the Factor. The defendant’s evidence is that the credit notes were not financed, and were meant only for good accounting practice to effect a withdrawal of those invoices from the offer to the Factor. These are all matters within the defendant’s knowledge alone.

</div> The plaintiff’s argument is misconceived. That case stands for the proposition only that <span class="font-italic">if</span> the defendant is found not to have been the true owner of the debts as at the time arbitration was commenced in October 2015, the arbitration must be considered a nullity. But that submission puts the cart before the horse.

In <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> Jarguh Sawit</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 829, the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between the assignment of an <span class="font-italic">accrued</span> chose in action and the assignment of other rights attached to property, such as the right to sue for <span class="font-italic">future</span> infringement. The Court made clear that an assignee may amend its pleadings to assert a cause of action that was already in existence when it filed the writ, but which was assigned to the plaintiff only after it filed the writ. As the Court noted, the vesting of such rights in the assignee has <span class="font-italic">retrospective</span> effect (at [63]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The Factor’s assignment back to the defendant of invoices C3 to C6 in December 2015 was for debts which the plaintiff already owed, first to the defendant and then to the Factor, before October 2015. The cause of action for a failure to pay these debts had already accrued as at the date the arbitration was commenced, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> October 2015.

</div> Woo JC cites Kim Lewison, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 1997) (“<span class="font-italic">Lewison</span><span class="font-italic"> (2nd ed)</span>”) at pp 245–246 (at [24]) as authority for the following principle:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a clause in a contract is followed by a later clause which destroys the effect of the first clause, the later clause is to be rejected as repugnant and the earlier clause prevails. <span class="font-italic">If, however, the later clause can be read as qualifying rather than destroying the effect of the earlier clause, then the two are to be read together, and effect given to both</span>. … Provisions are inconsistent if they cannot sensibly be read together. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The defendant submits, on the other hand, that it is cl 3 which captures the essence of the parties’ intent in entering into the Open Debt Agreement. It will be noted that cl 3 transfers to the Russian Corporation the plaintiff’s obligation under the Distributor Agreement <span class="font-italic">to pay the</span><span class="font-italic"> Open Debt</span>. That is the effect of the words “such obligations” in cl 3, which refers back to cl 1 and the connection established there between the transferred obligations and the Open Debt. The extinction of the plaintiff’s obligations under the Distributor Agreement effected by cl 4, on the other hand, is unqualified. Clause 4 provides on its face that <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the plaintiff’s obligations under the Distributor Agreement will be extinguished, not just its obligation to pay the Open Debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 The defendant submits that this unqualified reading of cl 4 cannot have been the parties’ intention. Even assuming that the obligation to pay the Open Debt was transferred to the Russian Corporation immediately, thereby releasing the plaintiff immediately from its obligation to pay the Open Debt, the plaintiff owed other debts under the Distributor Agreement directly to the defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> Debt 1A. Clause 4 on its face would have the effect of releasing the plaintiff from liability to pay those debts too. But it could not have been the intent of the parties to use the Debt Transfer agreement to release the plaintiff from even its obligation to pay Debt 1A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 The defendant submits, further, that it would be uncommercial for the defendant to agree to release the plaintiff immediately from its obligation to pay the Open Debt upon a third party’s mere promise to pay, as cll 1 and 4 appear to do, without retaining for itself some right of recourse against the plaintiff if that payment did not take place. That intent, the defendant submits, is captured in cl 3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 I begin by pointing out that the narrow principle of construction cited in <span class="font-italic">Lewison</span><span class="font-italic"> (2nd ed)</span> (at [200] above) is expressly stated, in later editions of the author’s work, to be <span class="font-italic">secondary</span> to the broader principle that a contract must be construed as a coherent whole and every part of it given effect to where possible (see Kim Lewison, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Lewison</span><span class="font-italic"> (6th ed)</span>”) at p 522). The court’s duty, when faced with apparently inconsistent contractual terms, is to “do its best to reconcile them if that can conscientiously and fairly be done” (<span class="font-italic">Soci</span><span class="font-italic">été Générale, London Branch v Geys</span> [2013] 1 All ER 1061 at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 In other words, this principle of construction does not assist the plaintiff unless the later clauses of the Debt Transfer Agreement “destroy the effect” of the earlier clauses. In my view, applying the contextual approach to the construction of contracts, cll 1 to 4 of the agreement can be read together in a way consistent with the intentions of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 The circumstances in which the parties entered into the Debt Transfer Agreement are relevant. The defendant’s evidence in the arbitration is that from September 2014, the plaintiff began facing severe cash flow issues. From late September to October 2014, the plaintiff, the defendant, and the Factor were in constant correspondence about the plaintiff’s unpaid debts.

</div> I accept the defendant’s account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Seen in this context, cl 1 is relatively uncontroversial. It provides that the plaintiff transfers its obligation to pay the Open Debt to the Russian Corporation effective 10 December 2014. Both parties accept that cl 1 means what it says.

The defendant accepts this because this confirmation was necessary for the bank to accept rubles from the Russian Corporation and convert them into US dollars. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Clause 2 is also uncontroversial.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Clause 7 of the Open Debt Agreement preserves – even more clearly than cl 3 of the Debt Transfer Agreement – the plaintiff’s obligation to pay the Open Debt if the Russian Corporation fails to do so. The only difference between cl 7 of the Open Debt Agreement and cl 3 of the Debt Transfer Agreement is that in the former, the parties make clear that the Russian Corporation is to pay <span class="font-italic">the Factor</span>, as a result of the Factor’s purchase of the Open Debt from the defendant. The obligation of either the Russian Corporation or the plaintiff to pay the Open Debt is otherwise the same. From this, it appears that the parties did intend for cl 3 of the Debt Transfer Agreement to be an important part of their commercial arrangement, which explains why it is mirrored in cl 7 of the later agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 How can cl 4 of the Debt Transfer Agreement be reconciled with cl 3? In my view, it is possible to do so if cl 4 is read to mean that the plaintiff’s obligation to pay the Open Debt is extinguished with immediate effect and transferred to the Russian Corporation <span class="font-italic">until the time stipulated for the Russian Corporation to pay the Open Debt under cl 2 of the Debt Transfer Agreement expires</span>. The plaintiff’s obligation to pay the Open Debt would then revive if the Russian Corporation fails to fulfil its obligation under cl 2. I accept the defendant’s submission that cl 3 represents the essence of the parties’ intention. In my view, the only sensible way to read cll 3 and 4 together is to read cl 3 as qualifying or modifying the effect of cl 4 in this way, though not destroying it entirely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The construction which I have put upon cl 4 is admittedly not one which it bears on its face. Clause 4 provides, without qualification, that “<span class="font-italic">all</span> such rights, duties and obligations” shall be extinguished “<span class="font-italic">on and after</span>” the Effective Date of 10 December 2014. This provides on its face that the obligation to pay the Open Debt ceases to exist on and after 10 December 2014, with no possibility of revival 90 days thereafter. Although the incongruity in wording is unfortunate, I do not consider this to be fatal to the interpretation of cl 4 that I have adopted (at [211]). It is not unprecedented for the court, upon a true construction of the contract in context, to read down words that are unqualified on their face in order to uphold the parties’ commercial intent (see <span class="font-italic">Lewison</span><span class="font-italic"> (6th ed)</span> at pp 531–532). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 The Debt Transfer Agreement on its proper construction was not intended to extinguish permanently and for all purposes the plaintiff’s obligation to pay the Open Debt. If the Russian Corporation failed to pay the Open Debt, as it did in part, the plaintiff agreed that its obligation to pay the Open Debt which remained outstanding at that time would revive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 The plaintiff is therefore the correct respondent in respect of Debt 2B. The tribunal had jurisdiction over this portion of the defendant’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Debt 1A</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 I come now to the final category of debt: Debt 1A. This is the portion of the defendant’s claim in the arbitration which the plaintiff was always obliged to pay to the defendant directly. Debt 1A encompasses debit notes C86 to C93 and C96 to C106. None of these debit notes are endorsed with the Caution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 The plaintiff raises a number of jurisdictional objections with respect to Debt 1A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 First, in relation to all the debit notes comprised in Debt 1A, the plaintiff argues these are not proper commercial invoices and were simply debit notes “unilaterally raised” by the defendant to the plaintiff.

As explained above (at [184]), the defendant issued credit notes to cancel invoices C194 to C205, which were rejected for purchase by the Factor.

Instead, Steyn J held that the governing law and jurisdiction clause referred, not to disputes over the parties’ substantive rights and obligations, but to the arbitration itself, such that the English courts had supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration (at 130). While acknowledging that this interpretation resulted in some infelicity of language with the jurisdiction clause, Steyn J was of the view that the incongruity is preferable to treating the arbitration clause as <span class="font-italic">pro non </span><span class="font-italic">scripto</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> as if it had never been written.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 The <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach to the construction of jurisdiction and arbitration clauses which appear in the same contract has been applied in later cases.

</div> which appears to be the only local case so far on this issue, the arbitration agreement provided for disputes to be resolved by ICC arbitration. Another clause in the same contract provided that the governing law of the contract would be Singapore law, and that the parties agreed “for the exclusive benefit of the others” that the Singapore courts would have jurisdiction over any disputes arising from the contract. The assistant registrar, undertaking an extensive review of the authorities in the field including those I have cited above, applied the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach and gave effect to both clauses (at [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Upon a careful consideration on the suitability and applicability of the case law reviewed thus far, I am inclined to apply the technique of construction in <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> … locally and find that the cll 15 [the arbitration agreement] and 22.2 [the jurisdiction agreement] can be reconciled by reading cl 22.2 as a submission to the Singapore court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 To summarise the approach taken, Robert Merkin QC, in his treatise <span class="font-italic">Arbitration Law</span> (Informa, Service Issue No 82, 2019) (at para 5.13) notes:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the courts will, where possible, give effect to both clauses so far as possible rather than to say that one overrides the other. Applied to the present context, the approach adopted by the courts is to say that giving effect to the arbitration clause does not deprive the jurisdiction clause of all meaning, in that it remains applicable to enforcement of any award, whereas giving effect to the jurisdiction clause would negative the arbitration clause. The outcome, therefore, is that the courts will generally give priority to the obligation to arbitrate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 I adopt the reasoning and the approach in these cases. If the parties have included both an arbitration agreement in cl 25.9 and a jurisdiction clause in cl 25.8, and in the absence of any allegation that either clause is vitiated in some way, I must proceed on the basis that the parties intended for both clauses to have <span class="font-italic">some</span> contractual effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 As the authorities acknowledge, the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach to construing arbitration and jurisdiction clauses together is not perfect. In particular, in this case, the parties agreed in cl 25.8 that “[t]he jurisdiction and venue for any legal action … <span class="font-italic">arising out of or connected with this Agreement, or the Services and Products furnished hereunder</span>” shall be the Singapore courts. On the face of it, this clause envisages that substantive disputes surrounding the Distributor Agreement, and not only matters of curial review of an arbitration under cl 25.9, will be determined by the Singapore courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 Nonetheless, a dispute over the parties’ substantive rights and obligations arising out of or connected with the Distributor Agreement cannot obviously be the subject of <span class="font-italic">both</span> litigation and arbitration. The only practical – thought not entirely satisfactory – solution is to adopt the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach and hold that the parties intended to resolve substantive disputes in arbitration under cl 25.9 and to resolve disputes arising out of any such arbitration in the Singapore courts in the exercise of their supervisory jurisdiction under cl 25.8. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 This approach is consistent with the underlying trend in Singapore arbitration jurisprudence that a clear intent to arbitrate disputes manifested in an international commercial contract should, as far as possible, be upheld. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 Accordingly, I dismiss these final two points which the plaintiff has raised on jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Alternative ground: composition of the tribunal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 The plaintiff also seeks to set aside the award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law, on the basis that the composition of the tribunal was not in accordance with the parties’ agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 The crux of the plaintiff’s argument is that the appointment of a sole arbitrator is inconsistent with the parties’ agreement in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement to have disputes determined by a three-member tribunal.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On 22 September 2016, the plaintiff reiterated both its earlier challenges and took the position that “the intent of the agreed nomination procedure is not being followed in this arbitration.” The plaintiff asked that the SIAC to “put a stop to the current arbitration and <span class="font-italic">… let the plaintiff nominate and appoint a co-arbitrator</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 In the same letter, the plaintiff sets out four legal bases for its request. First, Article 11(5) of the Model Law obliges the SIAC to “have due regard to … such considerations as are likely to secure an independent and impartial arbitrator”. Second, Article 18 of the Model Law requires that “parties shall be treated with equality”.  Third, the plaintiff pointed out to the SIAC that it should allow the plaintiff to nominate its arbitrator out of time because the 30-day period for one party to exercise its right to appoint an arbitrator under cl 25.9 is not of the essence. For this proposition, the plaintiff relied on five cases decided by the US federal courts. Finally, the plaintiff made the point that the appointment of a sole arbitrator was inconsistent with the parties’ intention manifested in their arbitration agreement to have their disputes heard by a three-member tribunal. The plaintiff’s position was that the SIAC should have the plaintiff’s challenges determined by a three-member tribunal and that it would participate in the arbitration to vindicate its challenges as a preliminary point.

The award cannot be set aside on an alleged defect in the tribunal’s constitution when the tribunal was constituted precisely in accordance with the parties’ agreed default procedure and when recourse to that default procedure was necessitated by the plaintiff’s own refusal or failure to nominate an arbitrator.

</div> the parties’ arbitration agreement provided for the tribunal to comprise three arbitrators. But it also provided that “[s]hould one of the parties neglect or refuse to appoint an Arbitrator within twenty-one days after receipt of request from the other party, the single Arbitrator appointed shall have the right to decide alone”. The respondent did not nominate an arbitrator within the stipulated three-week period. The claimant applied to the federal court under s 4 of the Arbitration Act 9 USC (US) (1925) (“USAA”) to compel the respondent to submit to arbitration by a tribunal constituted only by the claimant’s nominee. The court held that in the absence of <span class="font-italic">unreasonable</span> refusal by the respondent to appoint an arbitrator, the parties’ agreement for a three-member tribunal should continue to bind the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 The plaintiff relies on <span class="font-italic">Utility Oil Corporation</span> to argue that the parties’ express provision in their arbitration agreement for a three-member tribunal should be upheld in this case because the plaintiff did not refuse unreasonably to appoint an arbitrator but was delayed by the SIAC’s own failure to acknowledge the plaintiff’s informal challenge to the defendant’s nominee’s appointment on grounds of a potential conflict of interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 I reject the plaintiff’s submission. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Re Utility Oil Corporation</span>, and the line of US cases which follow it is of no relevance to an application to set aside an award under Article 34 of the Model Law. These US cases concerned an application for an order to compel a respondent to arbitrate a dispute under s 4 of the USAA. That is, in effect, an application for relief <span class="font-italic">in the nature of specific performance</span> of the arbitration agreement. The courts considering those applications were therefore required under the rules of equity to try and reach a “fair and equitable interpretation” of the agreement (<span class="font-italic">Re Utility Oil Corporation</span> at 680–681). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 An application to set aside an award under any of the grounds set out in Art 34 of the Model Law is of a wholly different nature to an application under s 4 of the USAA. An applicant who seeks relief under Article 34 is not asking the court to grant relief in the nature of specific performance of the arbitration agreement. If the criteria underlying one of the grounds for setting aside an award which are set out in Article 34 are established, the application succeeds. Otherwise, the application fails. Whatever may be the position of a court hearing an application under s 4 of the USAA, there is no scope for a court hearing an application under Article 34 of the Model Law to try and reach a “fair and equitable interpretation” of the parties’ arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 There is also no principle of general application which justifies construing an arbitration agreement in “a fair and equitable” manner in order to determine whether a ground for setting aside an arbitration award under Article 34 has been established. An arbitration agreement is to be construed like any other contract: by applying a contextual interpretation to the words chosen by the parties to ascertain objectively what the parties intended. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 Further, in <span class="font-italic">Triulzi</span><span class="font-italic"> Cesare SRL v Xinyi Group (Glass) Co Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 114 (“<span class="font-italic">Triulzi</span><span class="font-italic"> Cesare</span>”), Belinda Ang J held that a departure from the parties’ agreed procedure is not a ground for setting aside an award if the departure was the result of the applicant’s own conduct, failures or strategic choices (at [51]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the other hand, Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law is <span class="font-italic">not</span> engaged if the non-observance of either an agreed procedure (Art 19(1)) or the minimum procedural requirements of Art 18 is <span class="font-italic">not</span> due to circumstances attributable to the arbitral tribunal but <span class="font-weight-bold">is derived from the applicant’s own doing</span>. A helpful commentary that stresses the same point is made in respect of the purpose of Art 18 in the <span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL 2012 Digest of Case Law on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration</span> (United Nations, 2012) (“the 2012 Digest”) at p 98, para 7:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The purpose of article 18 is to protect a party from egregious and injudicious conduct by an arbitral tribunal, and it is <span class="font-weight-bold">not intended to protect a party from its own failures or strategic choices</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 The plaintiff’s formal challenge to jurisdiction of the tribunal and its informal challenge to the defendant’s nominee on grounds of a lack of independence are not valid contractual reasons for its failure to exercise its right to nominate an arbitrator within the thirty-day period stipulated in cl 25.9. This is a case in which the plaintiff was well aware of the thirty-day period and of the consequences of refusing or failing to nominate an arbitrator within that period. At the very latest, the plaintiff became aware of this when it received the SIAC’s letter of 12 October 2015. This is also a case where the plaintiff refused or failed to nominate an arbitrator as a deliberate strategic choice. The plaintiff <span class="font-italic">declined</span> to nominate an arbitrator by its email of 9 December 2015. That was its only correspondence after the plaintiff nominated its arbitrator. The plaintiff’s main complaints from October 2015 until September 2016 were about the tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction and the defendant’s nominee’s apparent lack of independence from the defendant (at [251]–[258] above), not about being allowed to appoint an arbitrator out of time. The first time it asked to be allowed to nominate an arbitrator out of time was  22 September 2016. This was a good ten months after the deadline for the plaintiff to nominate an arbitrator had expired on 20 November 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 Having made a strategic choice not to exercise its right to nominate an arbitrator and having made a strategic choice to abstain from the contractually-stipulated appointment process, the plaintiff cannot now turn around and say that the SIAC or the tribunal should nevertheless have constituted a three-member tribunal. The tribunal was constituted precisely in accordance with the parties’ agreement set out in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement. It was constituted in this way because of the plaintiff’s own deliberate strategic choices. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 In the circumstances, the provision in cl 25.9 on the consequences of one party’s failure to appoint an arbitrator within the thirty-day period must have effect in accordance with its plain meaning. The composition of the tribunal does not depart from the procedure agreed to by the parties. The plaintiff’s attempt to set aside the award under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 I will add, as a final point, that the defendant argued that even if there was any breach of the parties’ agreement on the composition of the tribunal, the court should exercise its discretion not to set aside the award because there was no prejudice, citing <span class="font-italic">AQZ v ARA</span> ([101] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). I have some reservations about whether such discretion is as wide as the defendant submits. In <span class="font-italic">Triulzi</span><span class="font-italic"> Cesare</span>, Ang J engaged in a comprehensive survey of the authorities surrounding the court’s discretion to set aside an award, and concluded (at [64]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> Understood in the context of a general discretion, my view is that prejudice is a factor or element relevant to, <span class="font-italic">rather than</span> a legal requirement for the application of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law. In other words, prejudice is merely a relevant factor that the supervising court considers in deciding whether the breach in question is serious and, thus, whether or not to exercise its discretionary power to set aside the award for the breach. As the Hong Kong Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Grand Pacific</span> at [105]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… How a court may exercise its discretion in any particular case will <span class="font-weight-bold">depend on the view it takes of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the seriousness of the breach</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold">Some breaches may be so egregious that an award would be set aside </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">although the result could not be different</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It can be gleaned from this passage that the Hong Kong Court of Appeal recognises that there may be certain instances where the court will nonetheless set aside an award despite the absence of prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 I endorse, with respect, the reasoning in these paragraphs. That the plaintiff may not have suffered prejudice from having a sole arbitrator determine the defendant’s claim is relevant, but not determinative. Given the importance of party autonomy in arbitration, it would seem that an actual departure from the parties’ agreement on the constitution of the tribunal will be taken seriously unless it is clearly of a technical or trifling nature. Nonetheless, as I have found that there was no departure from the agreed procedure in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement, these observations are <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 For all the reasons I have set out above, I have dismissed the plaintiff’s application with costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Khoo Boo Teck Randolph and Liu Chenghan, Aloysius (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Toh Chen Han, Chan Yong Neng and Rakesh Nelson (MPillay) for the defendant.<br/></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
