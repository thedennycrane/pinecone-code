<p align="justify">1.    The appellant was convicted at the High Court of the charge

that he, on 20 March 2000, did traffic in a controlled drug at Block 39, Chai Chee Ave, #03-265 (the

flat) by having 78.04 grams of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, an

offence under s 5(1)(a), read with s 5(2), of the Misuse of Drugs Act (the Act) and punishable under

s 33. He was sentenced to suffer death. His appeal came up before us on 19 March 2001 and it was

dismissed. We now give our reasons.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The facts</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">2.    On 20 March 2000, at about 12.55pm, officers from the

Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) raided the flat. Present in the flat were the owner of the flat, one

Mr Syed Omar bin Syed Kassim, the appellant, his wife, Rosminah bte Ali, and their son. The

appellant and his family were permitted by Syed Omar to stay there. The flat was a small one-room

unit.</p>
<p align="justify">3.    Following a search of the flat, the officers found a grey

plastic box under the bed. In it were three plastic bags containing a total of 175 sachets of

granular substance which were later analysed to contain a net weight of 78.04 grams of diamorphine.

Those 175 sachets of granular substance formed the subject matter of the charge brought against the

appellant. The appellant and his wife was accordingly placed under arrest.</p>
<p align="justify">4.    A white plastic bag, wherein there were packets of

envelopes, was found on the top of a cupboard. Another packet of envelopes was also found on the

dining table.</p>
<p align="justify">5.    The appellant was asked by one of the CNB officers, Cpl

Khairy, in Malay, what were in the grey plastic box. He answered that they were heroin. His

statement was reduced into writing and no objection was taken by the appellant as to its

admissibility in evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">6.    On the ground floor of the block, beneath the flat, the

officers found a small black plastic case containing a straw of powdery substance, two syringes and

a piece of silver foil. The appellant admitted that those things were his, having thrown them out

from the flat.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Voire dire</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">7.    On 24 March 2000, the appellant gave a cautioned statement

to the Investigation Officer (IO), Inspector Saherly. Later several other statements under s 121 of

the Criminal Procedure Code were also given to the IO. The prosecution sought to admit the cautioned

statement, and the first of the other statements, which was recorded on 27 March 2000. The appellant

contended that both these statements were not voluntarily given. Accordingly, a <i>voire dire</i>

was held.</p>
<p align="justify">8.    In relation to the two statements, what the appellant

alleged was that the IO threatened to also charge his wife. He was thus coerced into making the

statements. He said to protect his wife, the statements were made.</p>
<p align="justify">9.    It is important to note that in the cautioned statement, the

appellant did not admit that the drugs were his. Furthermore, earlier on 21 March, the appellant

already knew that his wife was jointly charged with him for trafficking. Why was there a need to

make such a threat? In re-examination, he said he gave the statements to get her released. There was

a shift in position here.</p>
<p align="justify">10.    With regard to the 27 March 2000 statement, the appellant

also alleged that it was not accurate in that the IO failed to record several answers he gave.

Furthermore, some of his answers were not correctly interpreted into English. However, these

allegations were not put to the IO or the interpreter who was present during the recording. Moreove,

the interpreter told the court that when the completed statement was read back to the appellant, he

had nothing to add. The appellant also said that before the statement was taken, the IO told him

again to cooperate and admit that the drugs were his. However, the fact remained that the appellant

never admitted that the drugs were his.</p>
<p align="justify">11.    The trial judge, having carefully considered the evidence

tendered in the <i>voire dire,</i> came to the conclusion that the appellant had not raised a

reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of the two statements. He was satisfied that the statements

were made voluntarily without any threat or inducement. This was his reasoning:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">At the end of the <i>voir dire</i> I reviewed the evidence. I found it hard to

  accept that the inspector had threatened to charge the accuseds wife if he did not co-operate.

  The accused and counsel alleged that the inspector said that he will or shall charge the wife. It

  did not make sense for the inspector to issue such a threat to the accused when the accused knew

  that his wife had already been charged.</p>
<p align="justify">I also did not accept the accuseds assertion that he yielded to the threat.

  His evidence was that the inspector wanted him to admit the drugs were his. However, he agreed

  with the prosecutor that he did not admit ownership of the drugs in either statement.</p>
<p align="justify">I did not believe that the inspector had made the threats alleged, or that the

  accused had offered his co-operation and made the statements because of any threats. The accused

  had not raised a reasonable doubt on the voluntariness of the two statements. I therefore ruled

  that the two statements were voluntary and admissible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The statements</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">12.    In his cautioned statement, the appellant said </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I do not intend to traffic the drugs. I only helped my friend to keep the drug.

  He would call me the next day to collect the drugs and pay me some commission. My wife has no

  knowledge of the drugs. I plead for leniency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">13.    In his statement of 27 March 2000, the appellant stated:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> I am currently staying at a rented flat  with my wife and my adopted son

   The owner, Syed Omar stays together with us.</p>
<p align="justify">On 20.3.2000 at about 12.55pm, I was arrested in my house. At that time, I was

  having a meal with the owner, my wife and son. There was a knock on the door and the owner, opened

  the door. A group of men identifying themselves as CNB officers then entered the house. I then

  threw out a black plastic container out of the kitchen window. Inside the container, are two

  syringes and a straw of heroin. The straw of heroin is for consumption together with my wife. The

  group of men then handcuffed us and made a search in the house and us. They found a syringe in my

  pouch. The syringe is also used by me. They then found heroin under the bed, in a grey plastic

  container.</p>
<p align="justify">There are a total of 175 sachet of heroin in the grey container in three

  different plastic bags. The first two plastic contains 58 sachet while the third one contains 59

  sachets. There is also one weighing machine in the container. In the grey container, there is also

  some empty plastic sachets. The things recovered were given to me by a friend called M. His

  contact number is 98754115.</p>
<p align="justify">On 19.3.2000, at about 9.00pm, M came to the house. Nobody was around at that

  time. He brought along with him a white plastic bag saying that it contains heroin. I did not know

  how much heroin is there. He had asked me to keep it for him for the night. He told me to wait for

  his call the next day to arrange for the heroin to be either collected by him or sent by me. He

  then took out another plastic bag from the white one to show me the heroin. I then took the white

  plastic bag with some brown envelopes inside it and placed it on top of the cupboard. From the

  plastic bag, he took out three different plastic bags. He told me that two of them contained 58

  sachet of heroin each and the third contains 59 sachet. I then took the three plastic bags and

  placed them in the grey plastic container. He then took out the weighing machine and some empty

  plastic sachet and I also kept them in the grey plastic container. After we had kept the drugs, we

  sat down and talked for a while. M said that he would collect the drugs tomorrow and give me a

  commission. He did not state how much commission I would get. After a while my wife and son came

  home. The owner also came home soon after. M then left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Appellants wifes evidence</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">14.    The appellants wife, Rosminah, who was called by the

prosecution, told the court that she found the grey box along the corridor of her flat three or four

days before the raid by the CNB officers. She took it home, washed it and left it under the bed,

intending to use it to store her sons clothings.</p>
<p align="justify">15.    A day before the raid, M, also known as Emran bin Tahir,

came to see the appellant. Rosminah heard Emran offering the appellant a job. The appellant and

Emran then left the flat to buy a handphone. They came back later with the appellant carrying a

white plastic bag, which was the bag found by the CNB officers on top of the cupboard.</p>
<p align="justify">16.    That night at about 2.00 to 3.00 am, as she had

difficulties sleeping, Rosminah got out of bed and wanted to store her sons clothings in the grey

box. She opened the grey box and saw a number of plastic bags therein and in one of the plastic bags

she saw yellow substances which she recognised to be drugs. She woke up the appellant and asked him

to whom did the things in the grey box belong. She also asked him to return the things to the owner.

The appellant appeared to be in fear and used his handphone to call someone.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Appellants evidence</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">17.    The appellant admitted that he and his wife were drug

addicts and they would consume about one sachet of heroin a day. His defence was that he had

unwittingly come into possession of the drugs. His story was this. He knew Emran from 1989, when

both of them were inmates at the Selarang Drug Rehabilitation Centre. On 17 March 2000 he met Emran

at the Bedok Interchange. Emran sold to him a sachet of the drugs at $180/-, with payment to be made

the next day. On 18 March 2001, the appellant paid Emran for the sachet he took the previous day and

also took another sachet of drugs from Emran on credit. The appellant and Emran continued their

dealing on this basis on 19 March 2001. However, on this day, Emran, on learning that the appellant

was unemployed, offered the latter a job without telling the latter what the job entailed. As Emran

was then a contract worker, the appellant assumed that the job offer would be a cleaning job.</p>
<p align="justify">18.    In the afternoon of that same day, Emran came to the

appellants flat to discuss about the job he had for the appellant. Emran also suggested that the

appellant obtained for himself a handphone for easy communication. Emran offered to pay for it

first. Together, they left for Bedok Interchange where the appellant made the purchase. They then

came back to the flat where Emran bid his goodbye to the appellant without entering the flat.</p>
<p align="justify">19.    Later in the evening, Emran telephoned the appellant to say

that he was coming to the appellants flat. It was around 9.00  10.00pm when Emran arrived,

carrying a big plastic bag. Emran left the plastic bag with the appellant, indicating that he had to

attend to something urgent and would return to collect the bag later. Ten minutes later the

appellant received a call from Emran telling him that the bag contained three bundles of 58, 58 and

59 sachets of drugs, besides a weighing machine. The appellant checked the bag and became

frightened. He asked Emran to take the bag away. Emran agreed. But by midnight when Emran failed to

turn up to take away the bag, he had thoughts of, inter alia, throwing them away or calling the

police. However, he could not bring himself to taking any of these steps. Instead, he poured the

stuff which was in the plastic bag into the grey box, which he then placed underneath his bed.</p>
<p align="justify">20.    Sometime in the middle of the night his wife woke him up to

ask about the stuff in the grey box. At her insistence, he tried unsuccessfully to contact Emran as

the latters handphone was switched off. It was only at 11.00am to 12.00 noon on 20 March 2001

that Emran called the appellant to say that he was coming to collect the drugs from the appellant

and would pay the latter a commission.</p>
<p align="justify">21.    The appellant did not challenge Cpl Khairys evidence

that he found seven packets of envelopes in a carrier bag at the top of the cupboard and another

packet of envelopes on the dining table. The appellant said that the carrier bag and the envelopes

were left with him by Emran after they returned from buying the handphone on 19 March 2000. As

regards the packet of envelopes on the dining table, he said it was placed there by a Chinese

officer who took it out from the carrier bag. However, he could not identify who this officer was.

Neither was this fact put to Cpl Khairy or any of the CNB officers who testified at the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">22.    The primary defence raised by the appellant was that in the

evening of 19 March 2000, when he took over the plastic bag from Emran for safekeeping, he did not

know it contained drugs. It was only when Emran rang him 10 minutes later and told him what was in

it, that he knew of the contents in the bag. He explained that what he said in his statements should

be viewed in that light. He was keeping the bag for a friend not knowing what it contained. The

statement of 27 March 2000 was also not accurate as the IO did not fully record what he said.</p>
<p align="justify">23.    Emran was subpoened by the defence to testify. While

acknowledging that he met the appellant at the Bedok Interchange on 17 March 2000 and visiting the

appellants flat on 19 March 2000, he denied offering the appellant a job or buying the latter a

handphone. He also denied having, on 19 March 2000, handed over to the appellant a bag containing

drugs for safekeeping.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Finding below</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">24.    The trial judge did not accept the appellants claim that

he did not know the bag contained heroin when he took possession of it. Without deciding whether the

drugs belonged to the appellant, the judge held that the appellant was certainly in possession of

it, and even if the drugs did not belong to him, he had kept them for the owner, intending

thereafter to return the drugs to the owner, and that was sufficient to constitute the offence

charged. The trial judge did not believe the appellants assertion that he wanted to throw the

drugs away when he knew what they were. He held that the appellant had possession of the drugs for

the purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Appeal</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">25.    Before the scheduled hearing of the appeal, counsel for the

appellant informed this Court that he would not be making any written submission as he was not able

to advance any credible argument to challenge the findings of the court below. On the day of the

hearing of the appeal, counsel reiterated that view. However, we noted that in the Petition of

Appeal filed on behalf of the appellant, it was stated that the trial judge had erred in his finding

as he failed to consider:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1. That the appellant had no knowledge as to the contents of the plastic bag

  when he received it from "Emran".</p>
<p align="justify">2. That the appellant upon realising that the plastic bag contained drugs

  instantly formed an intention to return the same to "Emran".</p>
<p align="justify">3. That the appellant had reason to believe that Emran would collect the drugs

  immediately upon being told to collect the same.</p>
<p align="justify">4. That the appellant was not in a state of mind to rationalise and alert the

  Police instead of waiting for "Emran" to collect the drugs as he was also in a state of

  panic and in fear that "Emran" would harm him if the drugs were not returned to him.</p>
<p align="justify">5. That the appellant had any mens-rea to facilitate "Emran" to

  traffic in the drugs or any knowledge that "Emran" would be trafficking in the drugs

  upon receipt of the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">26.    All these points revolved round the assertion that at the

time the appellant received the bag, he did not know that they contained drugs and, upon being

notified subsequently by Emran of the same, he panicked and had thought of throwing them away. These

very points were carefully considered by the trial judge who could not accept the appellants

assertion that he did not know that the bag contained heroin when he took possession of it. This was

how the trial judge analysed the situation:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In his cautioned statement, he admitted knowledge of the drugs from the time he

  came in possession of them. In the investigation statement he elaborated on the circumstances of

  his possession. In the trial-within-a-trial, he claimed that he did not make the statements

  voluntarily. After the statements were admitted in evidence, he claimed that they did not reflect

  what he had said. He alleged that parts of what he said were not recorded, but that was denied by

  the inspector and the interpreter. He also alleged that substantial portions were put by the

  inspector to which he acquiesced, but this was not put to the inspector or the interpreter.</p>
<p align="justify">The accuseds account of the events in his defence raised many questions. He

  said Emran offered him a job, but he did not know what work he was required to do. He said he

  thought it was a cleaning job although he knew that Emran was a drug trafficker selling heroin in

  sachets.</p>
<p align="justify">I did not believe that the accused had wanted the drugs removed from the flat.

  If he had that intention, he would not separate the drugs from the bag they came in. There was no

  reason for him to take them out of the bag and hide them in the grey box under the bed. He would

  not throw the bag away, as he said he may have done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">27.    We were unable to see any merit in the grounds set forth in

the Petition of Appeal. The crux of the appellants contentions related to the question of mens

rea, namely, knowledge as to the things in the bag. The appellant himself was a drug addict. He was

aware that Emran was a drug trafficker, as the latter had supplied drugs to him. It defied belief

that he did not even ask Emran or look into the bag to see what was inside, unless he already knew

what was in it by prior arrangement with Emran. This, together with what the appellant had said in

his cautioned statement, as well as in the statement of 27 March 2001, established overwhelmingly

that he knew what was in the bag and the trial judge was amply justified to have rejected his plea

of ignorance and the story he tried to spin. There was no basis at all for us to disturb the

findings of the trial judge. Accordingly, we affirmed the conviction recorded by the court below and

dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">28.    In passing, we would add that even assuming the appellant

really did not know the bag contained drugs when he received it, and only knew of it ten minutes

later when notified by Emran, the fact that he kept it by putting them in the grey box constituted

possession of the drugs on his part even though he intended to return them to Emran the next day. By

virtue of s 17 of the Act, that possession was presumed to be for the purpose of trafficking. The

fact that the appellant intended to return the drugs to the person to whom they belonged would not

render the act of possession any less a possession for the purpose of trafficking: see <i>Lee Yuan

Kwang &amp; Ors v Public Prosecutor</i> <nobr>[1995] 2 SLR 349</nobr> and <i>Lee Lye Hoe v Public Prosecutor</i>
