That happens to be my bad luck, or a convenient position that the respondent has taken, that 19 September is the date that they put all their weight on because there is no data available for the 19th, but what we do have, sir, is data available for 7.49am on 20 September, and it is just impossible, given the location of the ship on 20 September at 7.49am, that it could have been loaded in Dammam the day before. And with your permission, sir, I just ask my colleague to do a very short demonstration by going on to a website called searoutes.com and putting data which is from all the documents that are on record. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So what we’re doing, sir, is that this is D-29, page 879. This is basically the coordinates for the ship at different points of time. I’m asking my colleague to copy/paste the coordinates, the latitude and the longitude for the first available time on 20 September 2013, ie at 7.49 am. We take those coordinates, we got on to this website called searoutes.com. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Now, here we are putting Dammam, the port in Saudi Arabia, and below that we are putting the coordinates which my colleague just copied/pasted from there. Now, for the speed of the ship we have put 15 knots, which is the highest speed that the ship has had throughout its route. Most of the time the ship's speed was substantially less, 10, 12, 11 knots, but against myself I'm assuming that the speed of the ship for this journey would have been 15 knots. Now, if you just do this calculation, here is the route that the ship would have had to take from Dammam to the point at which it was near Chabahar on the 20th morning. You can see that the distance is 1,261 kilometres, which would take 45 hours at the minimum to complete. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Therefore, it's impossible that the loading could have happened on the 19th and the ship could have been where it was on 20th morning. What makes it even more implausible that this could have happened is the fact that subsequently the data shows that the ship moves from Chabahar westwards. It's just implausible that the ship would be loaded in Dammam on the 19th, make its way to Chabahar the following day and then again go back westwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 [DBL] argued that this submission was accepted by the Tribunal and relied on in respect of the Tribunal’s finding that the Goods were not loaded in the KSA (see below at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 [DBL] further argued that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Searoutes Website was precisely a “demonstrative exhibit” covered by the Hearing Protocol, and in bringing it up only during oral closing submissions, [DBM] was in breach of the Hearing Protocol, taking [DBL] by surprise;

Thus, it is only in exceptional cases that a court will find that the threshold for a breach of natural justice has been crossed: <span class="font-italic">China Machine</span> at [87], citing <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Second, and similarly in line with the policy of minimal curial intervention in international arbitrations, the court should be cautious not to allow a party to use fairness as a licence to effectively mount an appeal against the tribunal’s decision. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>cautioned (at [65(f)]) that “[i]t must always be borne in mind that it is <span class="font-italic">not the function of the court to assiduously comb an arbitral award microscopically</span> in attempting to determine if there was any blame or fault in the arbitral process; rather, <span class="font-italic">an award should be read generously</span> such that only meaningful breaches of the rules of natural justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately remedied” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Third, the breach of the rules of natural justice must, at the very least, have changed the tribunal’s decision in some meaningful way: <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee</span> at [91]. The applicant must show actual prejudice: see s 24(b) of the IAA and <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [86]. If the same result could or would ultimately have been attained, or if it can be shown that the complainant could not have presented any substantive evidence or submissions regardless, “the bare fact that the arbitrator might have inadvertently denied one or both parties some technical aspect of a fair hearing would almost invariably be insufficient to set aside the award”: <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>at [91].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>clarified (at [51]) that <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee </span>“should not be understood as requiring the applicant for relief to demonstrate affirmatively that a different outcome would have ensued but for the breach of natural justice”. The material inquiry is whether the breach could <span class="font-italic">reasonably </span>have made a difference to the arbitrator, not whether it would <span class="font-italic">necessarily </span>have done so: <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure </span>at [54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Fourth, the fact that an arbitrator did not discuss his reasoning or state his conclusion in respect of certain issues, does not necessarily mean that he did not apply his mind to parties’ arguments on the said issues. In <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy</span><span class="font-italic"> Connected Pte Ltd</span> [2010] 1 SLR 733 (“<span class="font-italic">SEF</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>”), the court held (at [60]) that “[n]atural justice requires that the parties should be heard; it does not require that they be given responses on all submissions made”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">TMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM</span>”), the court held (at [91]) that a situation where a tribunal, after applying its mind, fails to comprehend the submissions of a party, or comprehends them erroneously, and comes to a decision which is inexplicable, falls short of a breach of the rules of natural justice. In this vein, the court cautioned (at [90]) against being too fixated with the explicability of a decision, as otherwise “[t]he general principle that errors of law do not found a basis for challenging an award would … be denuded of any significant meaning”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The evidential threshold for the court to find that an arbitrator had failed to apply his mind to an issue is therefore high. In <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, the court held (at [46]) that the inference that an arbitrator had failed to consider an important pleaded issue, if such inference is to be drawn, “must be shown to be clear and virtually inescapable”. Accordingly, the court held (also at [46]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If the facts are also consistent with the arbitrator simply having misunderstood the aggrieved party’s case, or having been mistaken as to the law, or having chosen not to deal with a point pleaded by the aggrieved party because he thought it unnecessary … then the inference that the arbitrator did not apply his mind at all to the dispute before him (or to an important aspect of that dispute) and so acted in breach of natural justice should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be drawn. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Finally, a party will not be allowed to hedge its position by complaining only after receiving an adverse award that its hopes for a fair trial had been prejudiced by the acts of the tribunal: <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [168]. This requires the complaining party to indicate to the tribunal that it intends to take up the objection at a later point in the proceedings: <span class="font-italic">China Machine </span>at [170].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 With these principles in mind, I turn to my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Searoutes Demonstration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 [DBL] argued that the Tribunal relied heavily on the Searoutes Demonstration in concluding that the Vessel was not loaded at Dammam Port, KSA on 19 September 2013.

As noted above at [74], [DBL] did not pursue the point in its oral closing submissions despite it taking place immediately after [DBM]’s oral closing submissions, which was when the Searoutes Demonstration took place.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I rejected this submission. It was evident from the Award that the Tribunal had clearly considered [DBL]’s defence of limitation and found in favour of [DBM]’s response that the Acknowledgments had extended the Limitation Period. What [DBL] was essentially complaining about was the Tribunal’s failure to explain <span class="font-italic">why</span> the Acknowledgments satisfied s 29 of the English Limitation Act. But all the Tribunal is required to do is to deal with the essential issues in the Award, and not with every argument canvassed under each of the essential issues: see <span class="font-italic">AKN</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46] and <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>at [60]. Put another way, on the face of the Award, it was not a “clear and virtually inescapable” inference that the Tribunal had failed to consider [DBL]’s argument that the requirements of the English Limitation Act had not been met: <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 [DBL] relied on the cases of <span class="font-italic">Front Row</span>, <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, and <span class="font-italic">BRS</span><span class="font-italic"> v BRQ and another and another appeal </span>[2021] 1 SLR 390 (“<span class="font-italic">BRS</span>”) to support its argument that the Tribunal’s failure to consider these arguments constituted a failure to consider material arguments or submissions and was therefore a breach of natural justice. However, the factual matrices in these three cases, which led the courts in them to find that there was a breach of natural justice, were very different. In this regard, the Court of Appeal’s holding in <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [47] is pertinent: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [There is] an important distinction between, on the one hand, an arbitral tribunal’s decision to reject an argument (whether implicitly or otherwise, whether rightly or wrongly, and whether or not as a result of its failure to comprehend the argument and so to appreciate its merits), and, on the other hand, the arbitral tribunal’s failure to even consider that argument. Only the latter amounts to a breach of natural justice; the former is an error of law, not a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In <span class="font-italic">Front Row</span>, <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, and <span class="font-italic">BRS</span>, the latter limb described in <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>was operative – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the tribunals failed to even consider the relevant arguments. <span class="font-italic">Front Row </span>provides the clearest example – the court there held (at [45]) that the arbitrator “had <span class="font-italic">explicitly stated</span>, at paras 55 and 56 of the Award, that he was <span class="font-italic">disregarding</span> the issue concerning Daimler’s obligation to organise, brand and promote the Asian Cup Series”. Hence, the court concluded that the tribunal’s failure to consider this important argument constituted a breach of natural justice: <span class="font-italic">Front Row </span>at [46].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The same is true of <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>. There, the tribunal found an important issue in the dispute to be inconsequential as the tribunal mistakenly believed that the parties pursuing the issue had conceded it. Hence, the tribunal failed to consider the merits of the parties’ submissions in relation to that issue: <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [98]–[102]. However, the court found that the parties had in fact never conceded the issue (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [101]), and hence the court’s failure to consider the merits of their submissions constituted a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Finally, in <span class="font-italic">BRS</span>, the parties <span class="font-italic">agreed</span> that the tribunal had failed to consider, whether explicitly or implicitly, the claimants’ evidence and submissions in respect of an important issue in the dispute: <span class="font-italic">BRS </span>at [102] and [106]. The court found that this undisputed omission on the tribunal’s part amounted to a breach of natural justice: <span class="font-italic">BRS </span>at [106].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In these three cases, it was abundantly clear that the tribunals failed to consider the relevant submissions, whether implicitly or explicitly. However, in the present case, the Award made clear that the Tribunal did consider [DBL]’s limitation defence but rejected it in favour of [DBM]’s arguments. While that was not definitive proof that the Tribunal did consider [DBL]’s specific arguments relating to s 29 of the English Limitation Act, it certainly did not lead to a “clear and virtually inescapable” inference that the Tribunal had failed to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 A useful parallel may be drawn between the present case and <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span>. The court in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span> found (at [60]), after reviewing the adjudication determination, that the adjudicator did consider the submissions of the parties, their responses, and other material placed before him. Although he did not explicitly state his reasoning and conclusions as to two of the four main issues in the dispute, it did not mean that he did not consider the related submissions. Rather, the court found that “[i]t may have been an accidental omission on his part to indicate expressly why he was rejecting the submissions since [he] took care to explain the reasons for his other determinations and even indicated matters on which he was not making a determination … [or] he may have found the points so unconvincing that he thought it was not necessary to explicitly state his findings”: <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>at [60]. Hence, no breach of natural justice was found.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In contrast to the adjudicator in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span>, the Tribunal did state its conclusion as to the limitation issue. Hence, there was a stronger argument that the Tribunal did consider [DBL]’s arguments in relation to s 29 of the English Limitation Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In so far as [DBL] was complaining that the Tribunal did not correctly understand or apply the requirements under s 29 of the English Limitation Act, that was a complaint with respect to an error of law, which was beyond this review: <span class="font-italic">BLB </span>at [68].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The enforceability of the Bond</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 [DBL] argued before the Tribunal that the Bond was unenforceable under English law as:

Taking [DBM]’s argument to its logical conclusion, it would mean that a tribunal which allows a party’s claim or defence must necessarily have agreed with all its arguments or dismissed those of its adversary. That clearly goes too far. There must be some indication, on the face of the documents and the tribunal’s award, that the tribunal had considered the critical issues and arguments: see <span class="font-italic">TMM </span>at [90] and <span class="font-italic">AQU v AQV </span>[2015] SGHC 26 at [33]. It will often be a matter of inference rather than explicit indication that the tribunal failed to consider an important issue: <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [46]. However, in the present case, there was neither an explicit nor implicit indication in the Award that the Tribunal had considered the issue of the enforceability of the Bond.

Under both heads of claim, the granted remedy would have been the return of the New Outstanding Amount. This was evident from the Award, in which the Tribunal essentially held that the “damages” for breach of the Sales Contract were equivalent to the New Outstanding Amount:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41. … I am accordingly satisfied that there was a clear breach of the express terms of the Contract which entitled [DBM] to <span class="font-italic">terminate the Contract and claim damages</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46.  [DBL] are liable for breaching the Contract and should pay to [DBM] the sum of US$4,683,418.97 [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the New Outstanding Amount] being the balance of the purchase price not previously repaid.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Thus, even if the Tribunal had accepted [DBL]’s argument that the Bond was unenforceable, and had considered only the Sales Contract <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>it would have reasonably arrived at the same result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In this regard, the entire basis of [DBL]’s argument that it suffered prejudice was incorrect. [DBL] argued that the Tribunal “took the view that [DBM]’s entitlement to terminate the Sales Contract and obtain a refund of the Purchase Price <span class="font-italic">arose by reason of the bond</span>”, pointing to the fact that only the Bond “expressly provided for such a refund”.
