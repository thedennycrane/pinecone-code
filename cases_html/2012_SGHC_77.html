<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal from the district court raises the
                    issue as to when time for an appeal starts to run - the date when the District
                    Court makes the order or the date when the District Judge (“DJ”)
                    refuses to hear further arguments. This is the sole issue on appeal. There is no
                    alternative prayer to extend time if the notice of appeal is held to be filed
                    out of time. This has not been a live issue in the High Court for some time now
                    and I am surprised to hear from the Appellant that it continues to raise its
                    head ever so often in the Subordinate Courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts and the Decision Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       DJ Wong Shen Kai made his orders on ancillary
                    matters (“the Order”) on 18 October 2011, which included,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, an order that the sum of $38,850
                    be deducted from the Appellant’s share of the net proceeds of sale of the
                    matrimonial flat to account for the Appellant’s debts which were
                    discharged by the Respondent. Three days later, on 21 October 2011, the
                    Appellant’s solicitors wrote to the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts to
                    request for further arguments. This letter however was not copied to the
                    Respondent’s solicitors as it should have been under the Subordinate
                    Courts Practice Directions. The DJ certified on 27 October 2011 that he
                    required no further arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant’s notice of appeal was filed
                    on 8 November 2011. If time for filing of the notice of appeal started to
                    run from the time the Order was made, the Appellant’s time to file a
                    notice of appeal would have expired on 1 November 2011. The
                    Appellant’s notice of appeal would accordingly be out of time by 7 days.
                    But if time were to run from the time the Judge certified that he would not hear
                    further arguments, then the notice of appeal would have been filed within time
                    as the last day to do so would be 10 November 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent, (the plaintiff below), filed
                    Summons in Chambers No. 19133 of 2011/H, (“Summons 19133”), to
                    strike out the Appellant’s notice of appeal. DJ Edgar Foo, (“DJ
                    Foo”), who heard this summons, granted the striking out of the notice of
                    appeal on the basis that the provision for an extension of time to appeal
                    pending a request for further arguments only applied to appeals in the High
                    Court and not in the Subordinate Courts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant now seeks an order that DJ Foo
                    erred in law by holding that the appeal was filed out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Filing of further arguments in the Subordinate Courts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Appellant argues that O 55C of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”), which governs appeals from interlocutory orders,
                    judgments or decisions made in chambers (“interlocutory orders”)
                    in the Subordinate Courts, is silent on the matter of further argument and what
                    a request for further arguments does to the time within which a notice of appeal
                    must be filed. Because it is silent, it is argued that there is a lacuna. The
                    Appellant therefore contends that s 28B Supreme Court of Judicature Act,
                    (Cap.322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) governing extension of time
                    to appeal pending a request for further arguments, should be used as a
                    supplement to O 55C to provide a mechanism which deals with a request for
                    further arguments and appeal timelines. There should be uniformity for such
                    appeals, be they from the Subordinate Court to a High Court judge or from the
                    High Court to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subordinate Court Act (SCA) vis-a-vis the SCJA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Having considered the matter, I regretfully
                    cannot agree with the Appellant’s submission. There are two different
                    regimes governing appeals from interlocutory orders made by a judge in chambers
                    for the Subordinate Court and the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There is no statutory provision for the filing
                    of further arguments in the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap.321, 2007 Rev Ed)
                    (“SCA”). A failure to apply for further arguments on interlocutory
                    orders given in the Subordinate Courts has never operated as a bar to an appeal,
                    which lies to a judge of the High Court in chambers. In contrast, in the High
                    Court, the former s 34(1)(c) SCJA specifically barred an appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal from an interlocutory order of a High Court judge where the parties
                    failed to make an application for further arguments. The repealed s 34(1)(c)
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Matters that are non-appealable or
                            appealable only with leave</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>34.</b> —(1) No appeal shall be
                        brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>.</b>..</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) subject to any other provision in this section, where a
                        Judge makes an interlocutory order in chambers unless the Judge has
                        certified, on application within 7 days after the making of the order
                        by any party for further argument in court, that he requires no further
                        argument;</p>
<p>This was interpreted in <em>Jumabhoy Asad v Aw Cheok Huat
                        Mick and others</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 99
                        at [6] to mean the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By this provision, it is clear that there can be <em>no
                            appeal</em> against an interlocutory order made by a judge in
                        chambers <em>unless</em> the aggrieved party shall,
                        within 7 days thereof, make an application to the judge to hear further
                        arguments and the judge has certified that he requires no further
                        argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Contrary to the Respondent’s submissions,
                    the new s 28B SCJA was not simply intended to replace the former
                    s 34(1)(c). One of the main reasons for S 34(1)(c)’s repeal, by
                    amendments to the SCJA in 2011 (“the 2011 SCJA Amendments”), was
                    to remove the harshness of preventing an appeal for parties who failed to apply
                    for further arguments. Senior Minister of State for Law, Associate Professor Ho
                    Peng Kee explained the implications of this replacement in the Parliamentary
                    Debate on the Second Reading of the SCJA (Amendment) Bill on 18 October
                    2010:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Currently, a litigant <em>must</em> first apply to
                        the High Court to make “Further Arguments” before he can file
                        an appeal to the Court of Appeal. Failure to do so within the stipulated
                        time frame could prevent the litigant from subsequently filing an appeal to
                        the Court of Appeal. This amendment <em>removes the technical
                            requirement by making the need to file such “Further
                            Arguments” voluntary</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Other reasons included the tight timelines that could be caused by a
                    late reply from the judge as to whether he wished to hear further arguments and
                    the practical difficulties in distinguishing interlocutory and final orders. In
                    any case neither the SCA nor the SCJA contain provisions in relation to the
                    mechanism or procedure for filing further arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     O 55C r 1 provides the procedure for
                    appeals from interlocutory orders of a DJ or Magistrate in chambers. As pointed
                    out by the Appellant, it is silent on the procedure or time lines when a party
                    asks for further arguments thereon. However, the Practice Direction in the
                    Subordinate Courts, at para. 122 in Part XII, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1"><b>122.   </b>
<b>Requests
                            for further arguments before the Judge or

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    All
                            requests for further arguments shall be by way of letter and
                            should:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    state the party making the
                            request;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    identify the Judge or Registrar who heard the
                                matter in question;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    specify when the order concerned was
                                made;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    state the provision of law under which the
                                request is made;</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(f)    include a copy of each of the authorities
                                cited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    A copy of the request should be furnished to all
                            parties concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    All requests should be addressed to the
                            Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">O 55C r 1(4) provides that unless the Court otherwise
                    orders, the notice of appeal must be filed within 14 days of the judgment, order
                    or decision appealed against. O 55C r 1(5) provides that except so far
                    as a Court may otherwise direct, an appeal under this Rule shall not operate as
                    a stay of proceedings in which the appeal is brought. The Practice Direction
                    makes no mention of the time within which the appeal must be filed if a request
                    is made for further argument. This must mean time is not extended when such a
                    request is made because O 55C r 1(4) still takes effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the High Court, the mechanism or procedure
                    laid down when an application for further argument is made is found in O 56
                    r 2. O 56 r 4 specifically provides that O 56 shall only apply to
                    proceedings in the Supreme Court. Prior to the 2011 Amendments to the SCJA, the
                    former O 56 r 2(1) provided that an application to a judge for further
                    argument shall be made in accordance with practice directions for the time being
                    issued by the Registrar. These Supreme Court Practice Directions, at para.
                    71(1)-(4), were identical to those prevailing in the Subordinate Courts referred
                    to above, save that there was one extra sub-paragraph which dispensed with the
                    need to comply with para. 71(1)(e) and (f) if the request for further
                    argument was merely to comply with s 34(1)(c) SCJA. After the 2011
                    Amendments to the SCJA, para. 71(4)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> was removed and it is now identical to para.
                    122, Part XII of the Subordinate Court Practice Directions quoted
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Importantly, O 56 r 2(2)
                    specifically provides that if there was no answer as to whether the Judge was
                    prepared to hear further arguments within 14 days of the receipt of the
                    application, then the Judge was deemed to have certified that he required no
                    further arguments; O 56 r 2(2) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless the Registrar informs the party making the application within 14
                        days of the receipt of the application that the Judge requires further
                        arguments, the Judge shall be deemed to have certified that he requires no
                        further arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In contrast, O 55C r 1 does not contain a similar
                    sub-rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Principles governing further arguments before the amended S 28B
                SCJA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There appears to be case law which rules that
                    time for an appeal runs from the time the judge refuses to hear further
                    arguments, or hears and rejects these arguments: see <em>Thomson

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 34(2) [<em>ie</em> s 34(2) of the repealed
                        Supreme Court of Judicature Act] contemplates a situation where a party who
                        is adversely affected by an interlocutory order may wish to appeal against
                        that order but before so doing would like the judge to reconsider the order
                        in the light of such further arguments as he may be able to put forward.
                            <em>If a judge agrees to hear further arguments, it must
                            mean that he is prepared to change his mind</em> if on hearing
                        further arguments he comes to the conclusion that the original decision is
                        wrong wholly or in some respects. <em>In other words, until
                            he has heard such arguments, his decision must remain</em>
                            tentative<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However the facts of the case are distinguishable from the present
                    because the judge initially agreed to hear further arguments. On the day fixed
                    to hear further arguments the judge changed his mind and commented that his
                    decision was a final decision and the Appellants had failed to comply with the
                    practice direction. The underlying assumption of this reasoning was therefore
                    that the judge agreed to hear further arguments in the first place. <em>Thomson Plaza</em> is distinguishable from this appeal
                    because the DJ here had not agreed to hear further arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The real question in this appeal is what
                    happens when a request for further arguments has been filed but there is no
                    response from the DJ before the time for appeal runs out. As noted above,
                    O 56 r 2(2) makes provision for this eventuality in the High Court.
                    This rule was interpreted in <em>Aberdeen Asset Management Asia v
                        Fraser &amp; Neave</em> [2001] 4 SLR 441 (“<em>Aberdeen Asset Management</em>”) to mean that, if no
                    reply is given, the time period for allowing an appeal starts from the end of
                    the 14 days:</p>
<p class="Judg-1">... on the date the aggrieved party is informed by
                    the Registrar that the judge does not require further argument or on the expiry
                    of the 14 days limited, as the case may be, the aggrieved party may then proceed
                    with the appeal to this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Where the rules are silent, as O 55C is,
                    and where a request for further argument is not a bar to an appeal, then
                        <em>Aberdeen Asset Management</em> and its approach is
                    inapplicable. As O 55C r 1(4) states clearly, a litigant who wishes to
                    appeal against an interlocutory order made by a DJ or Magistrate in chambers,
                    must file his notice of appeal within 14 days after the judgment, order or
                    direction appealed against was made, irrespective of whether he writes in for
                    further argument. As a practical measure the least the litigant could do is to
                    ask the court to grant an appropriate order extending time or to inform the
                    other party or parties pursuant to the Subordinate Courts Practice Directions at
                    para. 122, Part XII, and secure their agreement not to insist on the
                    14-day time limit to file an appeal in an effort to save costs, (but whether the
                    court will agree is another matter), failing which O 55C r 1(4),
                    despite the obvious possibility of increasing costs thereby,
                applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The power of this Court to bring the SCA into line with S 28B
                SCJA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The short answer to the Appellant’s
                    contention that the court should apply s 28B SCJA to the Subordinate Courts is
                    that it has no power or jurisdiction to do so. Even if it had some residual
                    discretion under O 92 r 4, there are well known limits established by
                    prior authority, (<em>eg</em>., <em>Wee Soon
                        Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</em> [2001]
                    2 SLR(R) 821 at [27] and [29], referring to “a need of
                    such a gravity that the court should invoke its inherent jurisdiction”),
                    within which this discretion is to be exercised. O 92 r 4 itself
                    refers to preventing an injustice or an abuse of process. This would be a wholly
                    inappropriate case to exercise that discretion and to somehow read O 56
                    r (2)(2) into O 55C r 2 is something I cannot and should not
                    do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Court can apply the new principles in S28B SCJA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     S 28B SCJA is not a restatement or
                    clarification of the principles surrounding applications for further argument.
                    It was a change by the abolition of the s 34(1)(c) SCJA bar to an appeal in
                    interlocutory orders and to put in place new procedures and time limits for
                    appeals against interlocutory orders of a Judge in chambers to the Court of
                    Appeal. S 28B SCJA reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The new s 28B SCJA therefore makes an application for further
                    arguments on interlocutory orders voluntary and supercedes <em>Aberdeen Asset Management’s</em> ruling that a request for
                    further arguments operates as an automatic stay of appeal time lines. This also
                    statutorily overruled <em>Lim Kok Koon v Tan Jin Hwee
                        Eunice</em> [2004] 2 SLR 322 where the court had made clear
                    that an application for further arguments did not have the effect of operating
                    as an automatic stay for filing of the appeal where Chao JA had stated
                        at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n any event, on such a request, whether the judge certifies that he
                        will not hear further arguments, or there is simply no reply [within the
                        time limit set by O 56 r 2(2)], the effect will be that the order
                        of the judge stands and any notice of appeal must be filed within the
                        prescribed time reckoned from the date the order was first made. <em>Otherwise it would mean that a party could, by just requesting
                            for further arguments, extend time to file his notice of
                            appeal.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above passage is, in my respectful view, apposite and supports my
                    view set out at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Unlike the ROC, the SCJA does not apply to the
                    Subordinate Courts. Under s 2 SCJA, “Judge” means a judge of
                    the High Court. There is no room to read s 28B as applying to the
                    Subordinate Courts when a party is appealing from an interlocutory order made by
                    a DJ or Magistrate in chambers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b>A rational and
                        consistent approach for divorce proceedings</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Appellant also argues that prior to
                    1 April 1996, all divorce proceedings under Part X of the
                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Ed) (“WC”) had to
                    be commenced, heard in and determined by the High Court. All divorce proceedings
                    under Part X of the WC were then transferred to the District Courts by the
                    Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Matrimonial, Divorce and Guardianship
                    of Infant Proceedings to District Court) Order 1996 (“the 1996 Transfer
                    Order”). However, by subsequent transfer orders, all ancillary matters
                    which involved contested division of matrimonial assets of $1.5 million or more
                    were transferred back to the High Court for hearing. There were now ancillary
                    matters being heard in the Subordinate and High Courts depending on the value of
                    the contested matrimonial assets. The Appellant therefore argues that there
                    should be uniformity, certainty and predictability in both courts as to the
                    procedure and provisions relating to requesting a judge to hear further
                    arguments in ancillary matters. Further, under s 32 of the SCA, a DJ in
                    chambers hearing ancillary matters in divorce proceedings transferred to the
                    District Court is entitled to exercise the power exercisable by a Judge in
                    chambers in the High Court:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Powers of a District Judge in
                            chambers</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>32</b>
                A District Judge
                            shall have the power in any civil proceeding pending in a District Court
                            to make any order or to exercise any authority or jurisdiction which, if
                            related to a proceeding pending in the High Court, might be made or
                            exercised by a Judge of the High Court in Chambers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This, the Appellant argues, includes hearing further arguments in
                    interlocutory orders and s 28B SCJA should therefore apply. Finally, the
                    Appellant submits that because divorce proceedings are, in the first instance,
                    High Court proceedings, s 28B SCJA ought to apply to all proceedings that
                    have been transferred to the District Court pursuant to the 1996 Transfer
                    Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I cannot accept these arguments. The
                    Appellant’s arguments ignore one basic fact. The transfers of matrimonial
                    matters under Part X of the WC and the current split for ancillary matters
                    where the contested net value of the matrimonial assets fall on either side of
                    the $1.5 million divide are all legal, valid and binding. The history of these
                    proceedings cannot reshape what subsequent and clear statutory provisions, rules
                    of court or practice directions should or should not be. I have already dealt
                    with these clear statutory provisions, rules of court and practice directions
                    and that one set prevails in the Subordinate Courts and another in the Supreme
                    Court. S 32 clearly does not assist the Appellant. It only provides for the
                    powers of a DJ. It does not make an order of a DJ an order of a High Court
                    judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Having said all that, I do however agree that
                    where possible there should be uniformity, but that is more a matter for the
                    Rules Committee and not for a court to do so. All I can do is to suggest that
                    perhaps the Rules Committee might want to look into this. There is also some
                    merit in avoiding the situation where a litigant asks for further argument, then
                    files a notice of appeal before the time to do so expires, only to have the DJ
                    reply after the notice of appeal has been filed that he will hear further
                    argument. The rationale for the further argument procedure, (see <em>Singapore Press Holdings Ltd</em> at [40], <em>Aberdeen Asset Management</em> and Jeffrey Pinsler SC,
                        <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em>,
                        (10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Ed,), para 55C/1/2), still
                    holds true.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For the reasons set out above the appeal is
                    dismissed. As noted above, there is no appeal in relation to any extension of
                    time to file an appeal; this issue is therefore not before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Costs must follow the event. I award costs to
                    the Respondent and fix costs at $2,000 plus reasonable
