The Plaintiff argues that the Severance Package was in exchange for the Plaintiff’s resignation, and that constituted valid consideration. On the issue of certainty, the Plaintiff argues that while the exact amounts for the Severance Package had not yet been fixed when it was first raised by DW1 on 23 June 2016 these were finalised in the Defendant’s letter dated 30 June 2016. The Plaintiff further argues that compliance with the Non-Competition Undertaking was not an express or implied condition of the agreement for the Severance Package. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On the Plaintiff’s claim for the Severance Package, the Defendant argues that the Severance Package was an <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">gratia </span>goodwill payment.

Alternatively, the Defendant submits that even if there were a purported valid agreement for the payment of the Severance Package, it is void for uncertainty and/or lack of consideration. Furthermore, the Defendant submits that even if there was a valid and enforceable agreement between the parties, there was an express or implied condition that the Plaintiff must comply with the Non-Competition Undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Non-Competition Undertaking in the Defendant’s counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The parties agree that if the Non-Competition Undertaking is found to be valid and enforceable, the Plaintiff has breached it as he sought employment with DIC a day after his resignation from the Defendant.

First, it serves to protect the Defendant’s trade connections and customers, which constitute a legitimate interest. Second, the activity, geographical and temporal scopes of the Non-Competition Undertaking are not unnecessarily wide despite the inclusion of the Defendant’s “affiliates”. This is because the “Restricted Area”, Restricted Goods” and “Restricted Services” are prescribed and limited by the scope of the Plaintiff’s work “during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of termination of the Employment”. It is for this reason that the Defendant argues that the Non-Competition Undertaking is only limited to Cement Products in Vietnam, Bangladesh and the Philippines. The Defendant submits that the temporal scope of two years for the Non-Competition Undertaking is also reasonable as it would require about two years for an officer to build up the trade connections in the Cement industry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Defendant further submits that if the Non-Competition Undertaking is found to be valid, an injunction should be ordered against the Plaintiff to ensure that he abides by the terms of the Non-Competition Undertaking. Further, damages in addition to, or in lieu of, the injunction should also be awarded for breach of the Non-Competition Undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Plaintiff argues that he did not have any trade connections due to his lack of influence over the Defendant’s customers as he could not make any decisions on his own without seeking his superior’s final approval. The Plaintiff also argues that since the Defendant has more than 200 affiliates worldwide, the inclusion of the Defendant’s “affiliates” within the scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking renders it unnecessarily and unreasonably wide. Finally, the Plaintiff submits that the boundaries of the Non-Competition Undertaking are too vague and imprecise which unfairly prejudices the Plaintiff who is bound by it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues for determination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Plaintiff’s claim and the Defendant’s counterclaim neatly outline the two major issues that have to be determined.

</div> Furthermore, the Defendant argues that there was no consideration to give rise to a valid contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 To ascertain whether there was a valid contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant for the Severance Package we have to examine the circumstances before and leading to the offer of the Severance Package by the Defendant on 30 June 2016. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing</span>”) instructively stated at [53] that in ascertaining if an agreement has been reached, the courts will look at the whole course of negotiations between parties. This examination of the course of negotiations should still be effected in accordance with the concepts of offer and acceptance (<span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing </span>at [63]). Similarly, in the present case, this court must have regard to the whole course of negotiations between the parties to ascertain whether there had indeed been a contract formed. Therefore, it would not be correct to confine the search for evidence of a contract to 30 June 2016 as was the contention of the Defendant. It has to start from 23 June 2016 when DW1 first offered the Plaintiff the Severance Package in exchange for his resignation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my view, the meeting between DW1 and the Plaintiff on 23 June 2016 was of epochal significance in determining whether there was an agreement between the parties for the Severance Package. The event on 23 June 2016 as narrated by the Plaintiff that he was offered the Severance Package in exchange for his resignation would be a death knell to the Defendant’s arguments that there was no agreement if the court accepts the Plaintiff’s version. That was why the Defendant in its closing submissions side-stepped the meeting on 23 June 2016 and focused heavily on the events of 30 June 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Regarding the meeting on 23 June 2016, I noticed that in DW1’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) he merely stated: “On 23 June 2016, I met with Steve. I informed Steve that Itochu has plans to end Steve’s employment by the end of the month.”

The Defendant’s counsel’s failure to cross-examine the Plaintiff regarding the meeting on the 23 June 2016 and failure to put the Defendant’s case to the Plaintiff indicate that the Defendant accepted the Plaintiff’s version of the event on 23 June 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For these reasons, I am satisfied that on 23 June 2016 DW1 first offered the Severance Package to the Plaintiff in exchange for the latter’s resignation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Next, I shall examine whether the offer on 23 June 2016 was a valid offer. The Defendant has relied on the definition of an offer in <span class="font-italic">Aircharter</span><span class="font-italic"> World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 440, as cited in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 03.023.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">DW1 had first broached the topic of the termination of the Plaintiff’s employment at the meeting on 23 June 2016. DW1 told the Plaintiff that his employment with the Defendant would cease by the end of June 2016. In the course of the trial, DW1 admitted that he conveyed to the Plaintiff that the Severance Package would only be available if the Plaintiff were to resign. Conversely, the Severance Package would not be offered if the Plaintiff’s employment was terminated by the Defendant. This was in response to the question that I had posed to DW1 as follows:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: … Now, counsel is asking that if he was terminated, there would be no severance package. If he resigned on his own, there will be a severance package, is that how it was conveyed to him?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Witness: Yes, Your Honour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Furthermore, DW1 explained the various components in the Severance Package although he did not quantify the monetary value of these components, as this would not seem necessary at the first meeting. Given DW1’s position as the General Manager of the Defendant’s Human Resource Department, it must have been <span class="font-italic">apparent</span> to the Plaintiff that this was a serious offer made by the Defendant. DW1 must have obtained approval from the senior management of the Defendant to offer the Plaintiff the Severance Package before he met the Plaintiff on 23 June 2016. In other words, the Plaintiff was reasonably entitled to believe that should he resign, he would receive the Severance Package from the Defendant. Moreover, given the Plaintiff’s deteriorating relationship with the Defendant, it would not have been unexpected that his employment was indeed coming to an end.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Therefore, in the circumstances, I find that there was a valid offer made by DW1 on behalf of the Defendant on 23 June 2016. It is important to note that the Plaintiff was only eligible for the Severance Package if he resigned but not if he was terminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Next, I shall consider whether there was a corresponding acceptance of this offer by the Plaintiff. The Defendant has harped on the fact that the Plaintiff was not able to produce the email which he allegedly sent to DW1, purporting to accept the offer.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, the Defendant argues that even if there was an offer, there is no evidence of an acceptance and hence no contract. However, the contemporaneous documents (namely, the Letter of Resignation and the Confirmation Letter both dated 30 June 2016) show that there was a valid acceptance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Acceptance, as defined in <span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing</span> at [47], is “a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer.” In the Letter of Resignation, the Plaintiff makes clear his intention to resign from the Defendant with “immediate effect starting from 1 July 2016”. This undoubtedly represented the “final and unqualified expression of assent” to the Defendant’s offer made on 23 June 2016. On the same day <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 30 June 2016, DW1 sent the Plaintiff the Confirmation Letter. The Defendant stated unequivocally that it accepted the Plaintiff’s resignation, and that it also agreed to the Plaintiff’s early release. The Confirmation Letter also “confirm[ed]” the various components of the Severance Package as mentioned by DW1 in his meeting with the Plaintiff on 23 June 2016. The Confirmation Letter had further specified formulas for each component of the Severance Package which could be used to derive its monetary value. Lastly, the Confirmation Letter stated that payment to the Plaintiff would be made before 25 July 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Defendant has relied on <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng </span><span class="font-italic">Choon David v Global Maritime Holdings Ltd and another and another suit</span> [2018] SGHC 25 (“<span class="font-italic">Global Maritime</span>”) to argue that there was no oral agreement between the parties. In that case, the plaintiff was asked by his employer to retire early. The plaintiff alleged that in exchange for his early retirement, there was an oral agreement between him and his employers for certain sums to be paid to him. Choo Han Teck J held at [11] that there was no oral agreement between the parties, on the ground that there was no evidence to show that the parties themselves had believed that an agreement had been reached between them. In Choo J’s view, the contemporaneous documents merely showed that the parties were still in the stage of negotiations. He also pointed out at [7] that the draft agreement which the plaintiff sought to rely on was silent as to the terms of the alleged oral agreement pleaded by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52  The facts in the present case significantly differ from that in <span class="font-italic">Maritime Global</span>. As I have held above, the contemporaneous documents, namely the Letter of Resignation and the Confirmation Letter, are consistent with DW1’s evidence that he had informed the Plaintiff about the Severance Package. There was no indication that this was merely the subject of negotiations and hence would not be binding on the parties. The Confirmation Letter had expressly stated the components of the Severance Package and the method to arrive at the monetary value of each component which the Plaintiff is currently seeking to claim. Accordingly, <span class="font-italic">Maritime Global </span>can be distinguished from the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For the above reasons the answer to this issue must be that there was a valid offer from the Defendant to the Plaintiff, that if he resigns he would be given a Severance Package and this was accepted on 30 June 2016. The Confirmation Letter formalised and sealed the agreement between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue (b): whether the Severance Package was backed by consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is trite law that for an agreement to be enforceable, it must be backed by consideration. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant’s payment of the Severance Package was in exchange for his resignation and therefore that constituted valid consideration. The Defendant makes two arguments against this: first, that the Plaintiff’s resignation was not requested by the Defendant; and second, that the Plaintiff’s resignation was of no benefit to the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Defendant’s contention does not hold water. DW1 categorically testified that the Plaintiff would only be given the Severance Package if he resigned. It is clear to me that the payment of the Severance Package was always conditional upon the Plaintiff’s resignation as opposed to him being terminated by the Defendant. This is evident from DW1’s own testimony, as well as the fact that the components of the Severance Package were confirmed by the Defendant immediately after the Plaintiff tendered his resignation. Therefore, it is crystal clear that the Severance Package was backed by valid consideration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the request came from the promisor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Defendant argues that since it had not requested the Plaintiff to resign, his resignation cannot constitute valid consideration. In <span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing</span> at [17], the Court of Appeal stated that an act or a promise will only constitute valid consideration if it has been requested by the promisor. The case of <span class="font-italic">Combe</span><span class="font-italic"> v Combe</span> [1951] 2 KB 215 is commonly used to illustrate this principle. There, a wife tried to sue her ex-husband for the breach of a promise to pay her maintenance. She claimed that the consideration that she had given in exchange for this promise was her forbearance to apply to the court for a maintenance order. It was held that this did not constitute valid consideration because it was not her ex-husband who had asked her to refrain from applying for maintenance. Rather, this was done of her own volition. Therefore, the corollary of this principle is that an act or promise cannot constitute valid consideration if it was of the promisee’s own volition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 This argument is only valid if PW1 had not offered the Plaintiff the Severance Package in exchange for his resignation. It is clear to me that DW1, on behalf of the Defendant, was the “promisor” who promised the Plaintiff payment of the Severance Package in exchange for the Plaintiff’s resignation. In other words, the Plaintiff had resigned <span class="font-italic">because</span> he was promised the Severance Package, and it cannot be said that he had resigned of his own volition. Hence, the Defendant’s argument that the request did not come from the promisor fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Defendant sought to rely on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 592 (“<span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span>”). In that case, the terms of employment of the company stated that either party would be able to terminate employment by giving six months’ notice. The appellant tendered his resignation, but requested that the notice period be abridged to about three months. He was thereafter paid a sum of money representing three months of his salary upon his resignation from the company. The question that the Court had to consider was whether this payment was pursuant to a valid agreement supported by consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The appellant argued that the consideration was in the form of his accepting a lower amount of salary in lieu of full notice, which would have been six months’ worth of salary, and also his giving up of any claims against the company. On the salary in lieu of notice, the Court held that if it was <span class="font-italic">the company</span> that had wanted the appellant to leave early and forgo the salary he would have earned during the six-month notice period, then his acceptance of the lower amount of three months’ worth of salary would have been valid consideration. However, it was the <span class="font-italic">appellant himself</span> that had requested the abridged notice period, and accordingly it was not the company that had requested the appellant to accept the lower amount in lieu of notice. On the point of the appellant giving up his claims against the company, the court held that the company had not requested the appellant to forbear from suing it, and hence that too was not valid consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the present case the Defendant argues that the request for the waiver of the notice period had come from the Plaintiff and not the Defendant, and therefore it was not valid consideration.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This argument is misconceived because the Plaintiff is relying on his resignation, and not the waiver of the notice period, as the consideration for the Severance Package. As I have held above, I am completely convinced that the Plaintiff had resigned because of the Severance Package that he was offered by the Defendant on 23 June 2016. Moreover, DW2 and DW3 wanted the Plaintiff to leave the Defendant’s employment by the end of June 2016 and DW1 was tasked to carry out this instruction. Accordingly, <span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span> does not assist the Defendant in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there was any benefit to the Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Defendant argues that because it was entitled to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment without the need to give any reasons, there was no need for it to request the Plaintiff to resign. Indeed, the Defendant’s Company Staff Handbook states that either party may terminate the employment at any time by giving the required notice, without assigning any reason for such termination.

</div>
</div>
</div> Accordingly, the Defendant contends that it did not receive any benefit from the Plaintiff’s resignation because it was something that the Defendant was already entitled to. Therefore, the Plaintiff’s resignation could not be regarded as valuable consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Defendant’s argument assumes that there is no difference between terminating an employee and an employee resigning because it leads to the same eventual outcome <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the employee’s employment at the company will come to an end. However, it is undisputed that the Plaintiff would only receive the Severance Package if he resigns and he would get nothing upon termination by the Defendant. This indicates that from the perspective of the Defendant, there must be a difference between termination and resignation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Defendant alleges that the Severance Package was a gesture of goodwill to the Plaintiff. This would have been an attractive submission if the Plaintiff had been a model employee who was leaving the Defendant on good terms. However, the Plaintiff had been issued with the Letter of Warning, and his disagreements with DW2 were well documented. Furthermore, the Defendant had already decided to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment by the end of June 2016. There was no reason why this “goodwill” should have been extended to him, as opposed to simply terminating his employment. Clearly, there must have been some benefit to the Defendant if they could incentivise the Plaintiff to resign by paying him the Severance Package. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64  In my view, the benefit to the Defendant from the Plaintiff’s resignation was the avoidance of having to deal with the Union. DW1 must have known about the Union involvement as he is the General Manager of the Defendant’s Human Resource Department. If the Defendant had elected to terminate the Plaintiff, it would have had to expend time and resources to provide an explanation to the Union. This was especially so given that the meeting on 23 June 2016 indicated that the Plaintiff might not accept the termination willingly without creating a fuss. Thus, even if the Defendant had legitimate reasons to justify the termination of the Plaintiff, resources would still have to be expended to assuage the Union. However, if the Plaintiff were to resign, the Defendant would be able to avoid all this hassle. The Plaintiff’s departure would then be uneventful and the Union would not be involved. This was the most expedient way of severing the Plaintiff’s employment, and hence provided a valuable and meaningful benefit to the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65  The evidence shows that the Plaintiff had already informed the Union representative Andy Lim that the Defendant intended to terminate his employment, which he felt was unreasonable. It is also undisputed that there was a meeting between the Plaintiff, Andy Lim and Alice Yeo, the Union representative in the Defendant, prior to the Plaintiff tendering his resignation. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the Union would have been fully apprised of the Plaintiff’s circumstances. Hence DW1’s pre-emptive strategy of offering the Plaintiff the Severance Package for his resignation on 23 June 2016 had paid dividends as it had warded off the Union’s intervention. DW1 must have known from his vast experience as the General Manager of the Defendant’s Human Resource Department that this would be a wise and hassle-free approach to ceasing the Plaintiff’s employment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the circumstances, I find that the Plaintiff’s resignation constituted valuable consideration for the Severance Package. Therefore, the agreement does not fail for lack of consideration as contended by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue (c): whether the Severance Package was uncertain and hence unenforceable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Defendant also argues that even if there was an agreement between the parties for the payment of the Severance Package, that agreement would be void for uncertainty. The Defendant relies primarily on the fact that DW1 had never discussed “any figures, or even a range of possible figures” with the Plaintiff.

</div>
</div> Therefore, this is akin to an agreement to agree and hence is unenforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 While it cannot be denied that certainty of terms is an essential requirement for the enforceability of contracts, the answer to what is “sufficiently certain” is often a matter of degree, and the courts generally do not expect contracts to be drafted with utmost certainty. In particular, it is stated in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore</span> at para 03.156 that a contract will not be rendered “uncertain even though there is a term to be determined in the future, provided that the contract itself provides the means for ascertainment of that term.” An example of such a “means for ascertainment” can be found in <span class="font-italic">Brown v Gould and others</span> [1972] 1 Ch 53, which involved a lease agreement containing an option to renew the lease. The contract did not provide any figures for what the new rent would be upon renewal, but it stated that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… rent to be fixed having regard to the market value of the premises at the time of exercising this option taking into account to the advantage of the tenant any increased value of such premises attributable to structural improvements made by the tenant …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The landlord tried to argue that the option was unenforceable for uncertainty. However, the Court held that the option was valid and enforceable since the formula stated in the lease was sufficiently certain to guide the appointed valuer in coming up with a figure, and subsequently for the Court to make a determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I find the principle stated above to be directly applicable to the present case. Even though DW1 had not discussed the figures of the various components in the Severance Package with the Plaintiff at the meeting on 23 June 2016, the Confirmation Letter specifies the formula to ascertain the monetary sum of each component to be paid. The components of the Severance Package are listed in the Confirmation Letter (see [25] above). Items a, b, c and e are self-explanatory and are sufficiently certain. As for the “Annual Wage Supplement” in item d, it is defined in section C3 of the Defendant’s Company Staff Handbook and is thus also sufficiently certain.

</div> Finally, there is a specific formula provided for the calculation of the “Variable bonus of 6.33 months” in item f, which is also a sufficiently certain mechanism for ascertaining the eventual figure. All things considered, the Confirmation Letter which forms part of the contract, does provide a method to ascertain the eventual figure to be paid under the Severance Package, and therefore the agreement does not fail for uncertainty as contended by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Defendant has cited <span class="font-italic">Harwinder</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh s/o Geja Singh v Wong Lok Yung Michael and another</span> [2015] 4 SLR 69 (“<span class="font-italic">Harwinder</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh</span>”), where the Court rejected a claim for a “lump sum” payment due under an alleged oral agreement because it was too uncertain. However, in that case, the Court found at [20] that not only were essential details missing from the purported agreement, there was also no mechanism with which to ascertain these details. Therefore, <span class="font-italic">Harwinder</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh</span> can be distinguished from the present case, on the basis that the Confirmation Letter does provide for a mechanism to ascertain the eventual sums to be paid under the Severance Package.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue (d): whether compliance with the Non-Competition Undertaking was an express or implied condition precedent for the Plaintiff to be entitled to the Severance Package </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Defendant contends that even if the Severance Package was pursuant to a valid and enforceable contract, there was an express or implied condition precedent that the Plaintiff had to comply with the Non-Competition Undertaking in order for him to be entitled to the Severance Package. Notwithstanding the issues pertaining to the <span class="font-italic">validity</span> of the Non-Competition Undertaking, I shall first consider whether compliance with the Non-Competition Undertaking was indeed a condition precedent for the Plaintiff to be entitled to the Severance Package.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Plaintiff had raised the issue of the Non-Competition Undertaking on 24 June 2016. He had explicitly requested DW1 for a waiver of the Non-Competition Undertaking prior to tendering his resignation. This request was escalated to DW2 and DW3 who rejected the request. On 27 June 2016 DW1 informed the Plaintiff of the rejection. Therefore, this was a live issue at that time and it would have been open to the Defendant to expressly insert a term into the Confirmation Letter stating that any breach of the Non-Competition Undertaking would disentitle the Plaintiff from the Severance Package. I wish to reiterate that the Confirmation Letter was prepared by the Defendant. However, the Defendant chose not to do so. When DW1 was questioned about why the Defendant had not expressly included this term into the Confirmation Letter, he admitted that there was no necessity to do so because the Non-Competition Undertaking was already a part of the Plaintiff’s original Employment Agreement. Therefore, if the parties had intended for compliance with the Non-Competition Undertaking to be an express condition precedent of the contract, the Defendant would have stated so in the Confirmation Letter, which is notably silent on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Alternatively, the Defendant argues that it was an <span class="font-italic">implied term</span> of the contract that the Plaintiff would only be entitled to the Severance Package if he complied with his obligations under the Non-Competition Undertaking. The Defendant submits that such a term would meet the “business efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 at [101], the Court of Appeal laid out the three-step process for determining if a term can be implied by fact:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I do not think that the term sought to be implied <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that compliance with the Non-Competition Undertaking is a condition precedent to the payment of the Severance Package, satisfies the “business efficacy” and “officious bystander” tests. As I have held above, the Severance Package was offered to the Plaintiff in exchange for his resignation because it would allow the Defendant to avoid the hassle of having to deal with the Union. The Defendant’s interests in preventing the Plaintiff from competing with it, on the other hand, were provided for and protected by the Non-Competition Undertaking. These represented two distinct sets of obligations under two separate contracts that could exist independently. There was no necessity for the Non-Competition Undertaking to be implied as a condition precedent to the Severance Package in order to give it business efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The circumstances surrounding the severance agreement also do not give rise to an implied term as it was not obvious to any bystander that the parties must have impliedly agreed to this condition. Furthermore, the sole purpose of the Severance Package was to incentivise the Plaintiff to resign. Thus the Non-Competition Undertaking was not intended to form a part of the Contract for the payment of the Severance Package. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The Defendant cites <span class="font-italic">John While Springs (S) Pte Ltd and another v Goh Sai </span><span class="font-italic">Chuah Justin and others </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 596 (“<span class="font-italic">John While Springs</span>”) at [7] which states that “[n]o reasonable employer would have offered a bonus to a cheating employee”, as an indication that the term sought to be implied satisfies the officious bystander test. In <span class="font-italic">John While Springs</span>, bonuses that had been paid to the defendant employees were ordered to be refunded back to the plaintiff employer, because these employees had breached their fiduciary duties. Choo Han Teck J held at [7] that a “bonus is generally a payment fashioned as a reward as well as an incentive”. This suggests to me that a “bonus” is more akin to an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> payment that is given out of the goodwill of the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 However, as I have held above, the Severance Package was offered in exchange for the Plaintiff’s resignation because it would bring some benefit to the company in not having to deal with the Union. It was therefore made pursuant to a valid and enforceable agreement, unlike the bonuses that were considered in <span class="font-italic">John While Springs</span>. Given that the Plaintiff has kept to his end of the bargain <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to resign, the Defendant cannot deprive him of the Severance Package because he has breached his obligations under the Non-Competition Undertaking, which is a separate contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Therefore, I find that compliance with the Non-Competition Undertaking was not an express or implied condition precedent for the payment of the Severance Package.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary on the Plaintiff’s claim for the Severance Package</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In summary, I am of the view that the course of negotiations between the Plaintiff and DW1 started on 23 June 2016 and ended on 30 June 2016. It shows that the parties had entered into an agreement for payment of the Severance Package in exchange for the Plaintiff’s resignation. This agreement was backed by valuable consideration, and was also sufficiently certain. Furthermore, there was no express or implied condition precedent in the contract that requires compliance with the Non-Competition Undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Accordingly, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim for the Severance Package, save for item c listed in the Confirmation Letter. This is because the Defendant had expressly stated that this was an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> payment. “<span class="font-italic">Ex gratia</span>” is defined in P. G. Osborn, <span class="font-italic">Osborn’s Concise Law Dictionary</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 1964) at p 128 to be “[a]s of favour”. Therefore, the Defendant could elect at its sole discretion whether or not to pay it to the Plaintiff. I would like to add that if the Defendant had intended the whole Severance Package to be an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> goodwill payment it would have indicated so in the Confirmation Letter. After all, the Confirmation Letter was drafted entirely by DW1. But the Defendant only identified the payment of 3.7 months’ basic salary as <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> payment. Therefore, the total sum payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff pursuant to the Severance Package is $53,419.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision on the Defendant’s counterclaim - the validity of the Non-Competition Undertaking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I shall now deal with the Defendant’s counterclaim. At the outset, I would state that the Plaintiff accepts that if the Non-Competition Undertaking was found to be valid and enforceable, his employment with DIC soon after leaving the Defendant would be sufficient to constitute a breach. Therefore, I shall now consider whether the Non-Competition Undertaking, which is a covenant for the restraint of trade, is valid and enforceable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue (e): whether the Defendant had a legitimate interest to protect</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In <span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“<span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span>”) the Court of Appeal stated at [79] that “there cannot be a bare and blatant restriction of the freedom to trade” and there must be a “<span class="font-italic">legitimate proprietary interest</span> which the court will then seek to protect by way of the doctrine of restraint of trade” [emphasis in original]. Therefore, the first issue I have to consider is whether or not the Defendant had a legitimate proprietary interest which it sought to protect via the Non-Competition Undertaking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In this regard the Defendant has identified “client and trade connections” as the legitimate proprietary interest that it seeks to protect with the Non-Competition Undertaking. It cites <span class="font-italic">Lek</span><span class="font-italic"> Gwee Noi v Humming Flowers &amp; Gifts Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Humming Flowers</span>”) at [75] which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the facts of this case, I am satisfied that <span class="font-italic">the defendant has a legitimate interest in protecting its trade connection as against the plaintiff</span>. The plaintiff was the defendant’s sales manager, and therefore a senior sales figure in the defendant. She admits that <span class="font-italic">she has established personal relationships and rapport with the defendant’s customers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… The defendant’s business … is in large part built on its ability to establish rapport with its customers and to attract repeat custom. I am therefore satisfied that <span class="font-italic">the extent of the plaintiff’s knowledge of, and her influence over, the customers of the defendant means that the defendant has a legitimate interest in protecting its trade connection</span> against interference by the plaintiff post-termination. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I find <span class="font-italic">Humming Flowers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to be on all fours with the present case. The Plaintiff’s role was to be the “person-in-charge” for the Defendant’s Cement Products business in Vietnam, Bangladesh and the Philippines. Essentially, his job was to build rapport with these customers and establish trade connections on behalf of the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 During the trial, the Plaintiff sought to downplay the connections that he had with the cement buyers and suppliers in these countries, by stating that he could not make decisions without approval from the Defendant’s management. This does not mean he did not have trade and client connections when he was working for the Defendant. In fact, the evidence shows that he had developed a strong base of customers in the Cement Products trade. First, the contemporaneous evidence of the Plaintiff’s email correspondence with DW2 on the Manila Meeting shows that he believed himself to be the person most familiar with “all the parties and details” (see [17] above). The Plaintiff also claimed that he was the one who had started the discussions between the parties. Second, it is evident that the Plaintiff had significant influence and standing with customers, given that he was able to convince the Managing Director of Vissai to accompany him to Manila to meet with representatives from Big Boss. Third, it was undisputed that the Plaintiff had bought expensive gifts for his customers, and also arranged for free samples to be sent to them, all on the Defendant’s account. Fourth, the Plaintiff’s familiarity and relationship with DIC as a result of his prior dealings when he was with the Defendant enabled him to secure an employment with them a day after leaving the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Given the Plaintiff’s knowledge and influence over the customers in Vietnam, Bangladesh and the Philippines, he could have easily diverted business away from the Defendant to himself or his new employer. Therefore, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Humming Flowers</span>, I find that the Defendant had a legitimate interest in protecting its trade connections by way of the Non-Competition Undertaking from interference by the Plaintiff post-resignation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue (f): whether the scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking was reasonable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Having found that the Defendant has a legitimate proprietary interest to protect by way of the Non-Competition Undertaking, I now turn to assess whether the scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking was reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [75], the Court of Appeal stated that the test for reasonableness in Singapore has two aspects. First, the court would consider whether the restrictive covenant was “<span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> as between <span class="font-italic">the parties themselves</span>” [emphasis in original]. Second, the court would then turn to consider separately whether the restrictive covenant was reasonable in the interests of the public. With regard to the second aspect of reasonableness relating to the interests of the public, the Court stated at [77] that this would ensure the impact of local circumstances is taken into account in determining the reasonableness of the restrictive covenant. To illustrate, the Court of Appeal cited <span class="font-italic">Thomas Cowan &amp; Co Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Orme</span> [1961] MLJ 41, where it was held at [43] that if the defendant was not allowed to operate, this would have given the plaintiffs a virtual monopoly in Singapore. F A Chua J further observed that since the defendant had started operations, prices had fallen while service standards had not, and this was beneficial to consumers. Therefore, Chua J found that it was not reasonable in the public interest to uphold the restrictive covenant in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Having laid out the test for reasonableness, I now turn to examine the Non-Competition Undertaking itself. The Defendant has elected to analyse the reasonableness of the Non-Competition Undertaking by dividing it into three parts, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the activity scope, the geographical scope and the temporal scope. I agree with this method of analysis, but would add that in order for the Non-Competition Undertaking to satisfy the test of reasonableness, all three scopes would have to be reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Activity scope</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Beginning first with the activity scope, the Non-Competition Undertaking prohibits employees of the Defendant from dealing in “Restricted Goods” and “Restricted Services”. “Restricted Goods” and “Restricted Services” are defined as products and services that the employee was involved with during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of termination of his employment. In the Plaintiff’s case, it is clear that these “Restricted Goods” and “Restricted Services” are the products and services relating to Cement Products which the Plaintiff had been trading in during his time with the Defendant. While employed by the Defendant, the Plaintiff was engaged in the cement section. Furthermore, the documentary evidence shows that in March 2016, the Plaintiff was involved in a trade for gypsum. In November 2015, the Plaintiff was involved in a trade for clinker. These trades had taken place within the 12 months preceding the end of the Plaintiff’s employment on 30 June 2016. Therefore, it cannot be disputed that the Cement Products, in particular gypsum and clinker, and the related services provided in the trading of these products, would be considered as “Restricted Goods” and “Restricted Services” for the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Intrepid Offshore Construction Pte Ltd and another</span> [2012] 4 SLR 36 (“<span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics</span>”), Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) held at [67] that a restrictive covenant preventing the defendant from engaging in the design and manufacture of marine hydraulic and electrical installations was reasonable. This is because the activity sought to be restricted was the specific area of business that the defendant employee had been involved with, and the restrictive covenant “did not amount to a blanket prohibition to work for the marine industry”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Similarly, in the present case, the Non-Competition Undertaking seeks only to prevent the Plaintiff from engaging in the same area of business that he was involved in while he was employed by the Defendant. It does not impose a blanket ban on the Plaintiff against all forms of commodity trading that the Defendant was involved in. Indeed, at the beginning of the trial the Plaintiff told the court that he was currently self-employed as a coal trader. The Plaintiff also admitted to having prior experience in trading wood products. He is not prevented from trading in these other commodities by the Non-Competition Undertaking although the Defendant was also involved in these trades and more. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Defendant is depriving him of his livelihood. Thus, I find that the activity scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking was reasonable as between the parties. Even if the Plaintiff were prevented from trading in Cement Products, this would not damage the public interest given that suppliers and consumers of such Cement Products would still have other alternatives available to them. The Plaintiff is also not prohibited from engaging in the Cement Product trade in Singapore. Therefore, I consider the activity scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking to be reasonable in the interests of the public.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Geographical scope</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The next issue is the geographical scope. The Non-Competition Undertaking prohibits employees from dealing in the “Restricted Area”. This is defined as the area constituting the market of the Defendant and its affiliates for the “Restricted Goods” and “Restricted Services”. Reading the definition of “Restricted Area”, “Restricted Goods” and “Restricted Services” together, this means that the Plaintiff is prevented from dealing in the countries which he had been involved with during the 12 months preceding the last day of his employment. While the Plaintiff has been involved in trades to Oman, Indonesia and other countries, the Defendant is contending that the “Restricted Area” for the Plaintiff is confined only to Bangladesh, Vietnam and the Philippines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I accept that the Plaintiff had been involved in trades to Vietnam and the Philippines in the 12 months preceding the date of his resignation from the Defendant. In March 2016, he handled a trade of gypsum from Oman to Vietnam. Technically, Oman would appear to have come under the “Restricted Area” if it was one of the Defendant’s markets. However, Oman is not pleaded in the Defendant’s counterclaim. In November 2015, the Plaintiff handled a trade of clinker from Vietnam to the Philippines. Therefore, Vietnam and the Philippines would fall under the “Restricted Area” in the Non-Competition Undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 However, the Defendant’s contention that Bangladesh falls within the “Restricted Area” cannot be justified as it fails to satisfy the burden of proof that Bangladesh was a “Restricted Area” within the 12-month period. The documentary evidence before the court in the form of the delivery memos shows that the last trade the Plaintiff handled involving Bangladesh was in May 2015. This would be outside of the 12-month period as specified in the Non-Competition Undertaking. This is also corroborated by the Plaintiff’s statement that DW2 had restricted the Plaintiff’s dealings in Bangladesh.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Steve’s Affidavit, para 16.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Therefore, in my view, the “Restricted Area” for the Plaintiff should only be confined to Vietnam and the Philippines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Buckman Laboratories (Asia) Pte Ltd v Lee Wei Hoong</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 205 (“<span class="font-italic">Buckman</span>”), Judith Prakash J (as she then was) held at [24] that a reasonable restrictive covenant would have limited the restriction to countries in which the employee had actual and significant customer contacts. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Buckman</span>, the geographical scope of the restrictive covenant included countries where the defendant employee had never done any work, and was never exposed to any of the customers. Therefore, this was one factor for Prakash J’s holding that the restrictive covenant was an unreasonable restraint of trade.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In the present case, however, it has been established that the Plaintiff did have actual and significant customer contacts in Vietnam and the Philippines. In fact, he was able to arrange for a meeting between Vietnamese suppliers and Filipino buyers of Cement Products. Therefore, I find the geographical scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking to be reasonable as between the parties. Similarly, because this restriction would not adversely impact competition in each of these markets, I also find it to be reasonable in the interests of the public.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As a final point on the reasonableness of the geographical scope, I note that for some very big countries which span across a very large geographical area, it may be unreasonable to restrict activity in the entire country when the company may only conduct business in a few cities. In that light, I had queried counsel for the Defendant on whether it was unreasonable for the Non-Competition Undertaking to cover the entirety of Vietnam and the Philippines, when the Defendant mainly did business in Ho Chi Minh City and Manila.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In response, the Defendant cited the English High Court case of <span class="font-italic">Kerchiss</span><span class="font-italic"> v Colora Printing</span> [1960] RPC 235 at 241, which stated that it is sufficient for the ex-employee to have sufficient goodwill in the prohibited countries. The court does not require the employer to prove sales in every part of the prohibited countries. This seems consonant with the practice of geographical boundaries most commonly being demarcated along state lines. Therefore, even though the Plaintiff was dealing mainly with customers who operated in specific cities, it is reasonable for the Non-Competition Undertaking to restrict activity in Vietnam and the Philippines as the cement trade of the Defendant is conducted in the cities of these countries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 However, if the prohibited country is very big, such as China and the United States of America which have many major cities in which commerce and trade are done on a large scale, the situation may be different and the issue of reasonableness will be put to the test if the Non-Competition Undertaking is to cover the whole of such country. At the end of the day it is not one size fits all. The issue of reasonableness on the geographical coverage for the Non-Competition Undertaking will have to depend on the facts of each case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Temporal scope</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The Non-Competition Undertaking restricts employees from being involved in “Restricted Goods” and “Restricted Services” in the “Restricted Area” for a period of two years. The Defendant has cited a number of local cases where restrictive covenants with a temporal scope of two years have been upheld. One such case is <span class="font-italic">Heller Factoring (Singapore) Ltd v Ng Tong Yang</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 495 (“<span class="font-italic">Heller Factoring</span>”), which stated at [21] that “[t]he period of restraint should only be long enough for the danger of interference by the ex-employee to wear away.” In <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics</span> the Court similarly upheld a two-year restrictive covenant. One of the factors cited at [67] was that the industry in question was a highly specialised one, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Heller Factoring</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In the present case, the Defendant has argued that the two-year restriction is necessary because it takes time to build up customer connections in the Cement Products industry. It pointed out that the Plaintiff took about four years to build up his customer connections, and the Defendant would require at least two years to allow the Plaintiff’s replacement to try and rebuild those same contacts, without any interference from the Plaintiff. Indeed, if the Plaintiff was not prohibited from dealing in these products which he has become familiar with, it would be difficult for a newcomer to the market to build up his own customer connections. Furthermore, I note that the present case involves the trading of Cement Products, which is a specialised industry. Therefore, having regard to the purpose of the Non-Competition Undertaking, a temporal scope of two years is in my view reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 For completeness, I shall deal with a point which I had queried parties on. This pertained to the inclusion of the Defendant’s affiliates (amounting to about 200 worldwide) within the scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking and whether or not this rendered the Non-Competition Undertaking overly wide and hence unreasonable. In this regard I am satisfied that on a proper construction of the Non-Competition Undertaking, the definitions of “Restricted Goods”, “Restricted Services” and “Restricted Area” serve to curtail the seemingly far-ranging scope brought about by the inclusion of the term “affiliates”. I would also note that the restrictive covenant in <span class="font-italic">PH Hydraulics</span>, which the Court in that case had found to be reasonable, also prohibited employees from engaging in the business of the employer <span class="font-italic">and its associated companies</span>. Therefore, the mere inclusion of the term “affiliates” does not render the Non-Competition Undertaking unreasonably wide.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary on the validity of the Non-Competition Undertaking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In summary, I find that the activity scope, geographical scope and temporal scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking to be reasonable as between the parties and is not against the public interest. Additionally, it serves to protect the Defendant’s trade connections, which is a legitimate proprietary interest. Therefore, I find the Non-Competition Undertaking to be valid and enforceable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue (g): what is the appropriate remedy that should be granted to the Defendant in light of the Plaintiff’s breach of the Non-Competition Undertaking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The Plaintiff accepts that if the Non-Competition Undertaking is valid, he has breached it by virtue of his employment with DIC, a company that deals with Cement Products in Vietnam, one day after his resignation. This clearly falls afoul of the activity scope, geographical scope and temporal scope of the Non-Competition Undertaking. Therefore, the next issue for me to consider is the appropriate remedy to grant the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The primary relief sought by the Defendant is an injunction on the specific terms, as set out in the Non-Competition Undertaking, to be imposed on the Plaintiff until 29 June 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The High Court case of <span class="font-italic">Heller Factoring </span>provides some guidance as to what the court should consider in determining whether to grant an injunction to enforce a restrictive covenant. The Court in that case drew a distinction between an ex-employee who has threatened to breach the restrictive covenant and one who has not. The Court observed at [17] that the defendant had issued a tacit assertion of entitlement and threatened to poach the plaintiffs’ customers. The defendant regarded the factoring business as a free and competitive one, and to him it was “fair game” to poach the plaintiffs’ customers by using their proprietary information. Given the defendant’s proclivity for breaching the restrictive covenant, the Court held that an injunction would be warranted so as to better enforce it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In the present case, the Plaintiff has demonstrated this same proclivity to breach his obligations under the Non-Competition Undertaking. First, he was appointed as the exclusive agent of DIC one day after his resignation from the Defendant. Second, he acted as agent for Vissai and again set up a meeting between Vissai and Big Boss. Third, he attempted to establish connections with other Vietnamese cement companies such as Longson Cement through his corporate vessel of Changfa which he had set up when he left the Defendant. All of these actions had taken place well within the two-year restriction period that was imposed on him by the Non-Competition Undertaking. The Plaintiff also admitted under cross-examination that since he knew Eagle Cement personally, it was “fair game” for him to deal with them after leaving the Defendant. Under these circumstances, I am of the view that an injunction should also be imposed on the Plaintiff, according to the terms as set out in the Non-Competition Undertaking. This injunction would be to restrain the Plaintiff from dealing in Cement Products in Vietnam and the Philippines from the date of my order to 29 June 2018 as the operative two-year period under the Non-Competition Undertaking runs from 30 June 2016 to 29 June 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110  I am satisfied that the imposition of an injunction to restrict the Plaintiff from dealing in Cement Products in Vietnam and the Philippines for a period of two years would not be so severe as to deprive him of his livelihood. As I have alluded to above, the Plaintiff is still free to trade in other commodities which he is familiar with. The Plaintiff could also choose to trade in Cement Products in non-restricted countries. Indeed, he has demonstrated his ability to deal in different commodities such as wood and coal, and he has even had some dealings in Cement Products in Oman and Indonesia where the Non-Competition Undertaking does not apply. He could also trade in Cement Products in Singapore. Therefore, this buttresses my decision to impose the injunction on the Plaintiff that will take effect from the date of my order to 29 June 2018. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Damages for breach of the Non-Competition Undertaking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The Defendant has also claimed, as part of its relief for the Plaintiff’s breach of the Non-Competition Undertaking, damages in addition to the injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I shall address the methods for computation of damages that were suggested by the Defendant. The first of which is the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Merlin Financial Consultants v Cooper</span> [2014] IRLR 610 (“<span class="font-italic">Merlin</span>”). In that case, the Court calculated damages for the breach of a non-compete clause by considering the actual revenue figures of the business generated by the defendant employee in the year preceding the end of his employment. The Court then applied the appropriate discount rates to this past figure and projected two years into the future, on the basis that this would have been the amount that the plaintiff employer would have made had the defendant not breached his non-compete clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">Merlin</span>, there was evidence to show that the defendant’s departure and subsequent breach of the non-compete clause was a direct cause of the plaintiff losing its customers. At [74], it was stated that the plaintiff had written to a few of its leaving customers inviting them to stay, but they had replied saying that they had been with the defendant for a number of years and would prefer to stay with him. Therefore, the method that was applied by the Court in <span class="font-italic">Merlin</span> was a means of quantifying a loss that had been proven to be <span class="font-italic">causally connected</span> to the breach of the defendant. Notably, such a causal connection is absent on the facts of the present case. Therefore, I do not find the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Merlin </span>to be directly applicable here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Alternatively, the Defendant argues that damages can be assessed based on “Wrotham Park Damages”, a term which was popularised by the case of <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd </span>[1974] 1 WLR 798. In that case, the defendant’s land was subject to a restrictive covenant which provided that the defendant could only build on the land with the claimant’s consent. In breach of this covenant, the defendant built 14 houses on the land without the claimant’s consent. The claimant applied for a mandatory injunction for the houses to be demolished. However, the Court declined to grant the mandatory injunction on the basis that it would be socially wasteful to demolish the houses. Therefore, the Court awarded damages in lieu of the injunction calculated on the basis of the sum that would have hypothetically been demanded by the claimant in exchange for relaxing the covenant. Hence, Wrotham Park Damages are calculated on the basis of a hypothetical bargain between parties for the price to be charged in exchange for the relaxation of a restrictive covenant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 While I note that the applicability of Wrotham Park Damages in Singapore law has been affirmed by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span><span class="font-italic"> SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai and others</span> [2015] 1 SLR 163 (“<span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span>”) at [335], I am of the view that the present case is not an appropriate one for the award of such damages. First, even though Wrotham Park Damages is based on the hypothetical bargain between the parties, no evidence has been placed before the court as to what sum the Defendant would have accepted in exchange for waiving the Non-Competition Undertaking. Therefore, it would be straying too far into the realm of speculation for the court to simply pluck a number from thin air and use that as the measure of damages. Second, Wrotham Park Damages are typically awarded in lieu of a mandatory injunction. Given that I have decided to grant the injunction sought by the Defendant, it would not be appropriate for me to also award Wrotham Park Damages, as that would be akin to allowing double recovery. Hence, I would also decline to grant Wrotham Park Damages as an alternative to the approach in <span class="font-italic">Merlin</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Given that I have decided to grant the injunction that was sought, it would appear that there is no need for me to consider the issue of damages. However, the period of restriction under the Non-Competition Undertaking began on 30 June 2016 and was meant to last to 29 June 2018. As at the time of the trial, we were already in the middle of the first quarter of 2018. Therefore, given that no injunction was granted before the court order, it would be fair to consider whether damages should be awarded during that period, and if so, in what quantum. The burden is on the Defendant to satisfy that it had suffered damages or losses as a result of the Plaintiff’s breach of the Non-Competition Undertaking. The Defendant has failed to produce any evidence to show the nexus between the Plaintiff’s breach of the Non-Competition Undertaking and the loss, if any, suffered by the Defendant. Counsel for the Defendant admitted during the oral closing submissions that he was unable to establish that the losses were attributable to the Plaintiff:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court:  So do we have evidence? That’s what I mean.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Tay:  Sir, I need to be candid. We have evidence of a drop in business.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court:  Yes. But—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Tay:  But I can’t show a one-for-one match.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, this “drop in business” could be attributed to a number of factors. It could have been due to an economic downturn, changing business cycles or any number of other factors. Additionally, customers may choose to come and go for a variety of reasons. Without actual evidence to show that it was the Plaintiff’s breach that had directly led to the Defendant’s customers taking their business elsewhere and hence the drop in business, I could not attribute the loss suffered by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 However, I acknowledge that the Plaintiff has breached the Non-Competition Undertaking and he has demonstrated a blatant disregard for the restrictions that have been placed on him. Therefore, in addition to the grant of the injunction, I would order nominal damages of $1,000 to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In summary, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim as the contemporaneous evidence shows that the parties had entered into a binding contract for the Severance Package to be paid to the Plaintiff in exchange for his resignation. The Non-Competition Undertaking was not an express or implied condition precedent for the payment of the Severance Package. These were two independent contracts and there was no reason for the obligations under each of them to be fused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 However, one of the components of the Severance Package was labelled “<span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span>” and hence cannot be strictly enforced by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I also allow the Defendant’s counterclaim as I find the Non-Competition Undertaking to be reasonable and not unnecessarily wide. It serves to protect the Defendant’s trade connections which in my view is a legitimate proprietary interest. Therefore, by taking up employment with a Vietnamese cement company a mere day after his resignation, the Plaintiff has undoubtedly breached the Non-Competition Undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 For the aforesaid reasons, I would allow the Plaintiff’s claim in part, to the sum of $53,419. I would also allow the Defendant’s counterclaim for an injunction to restrict the Plaintiff from dealing in Cement Products in Vietnam and the Philippines up to 29 June 2018. Additionally, nominal damages in the sum of $1,000 are to be offset from the sum due from the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I shall now deal with the issue of costs. As the Plaintiff has succeeded in his claim he is entitled to costs. The Defendant has also succeeded in his counterclaim and thus is entitled to costs as well. The respective costs are to be taxed if not agreed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mansurhusain Akbar Hussein and Remesha Chandran Pillai (Jacob Mansur &amp; Pillai) for the plaintiff;<br/>Tay Yong Seng and Ang Ann Liang (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
