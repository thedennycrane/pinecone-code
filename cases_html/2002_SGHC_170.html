<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">INTRODUCTION </p>
<p></p></i></b>1.    The Plaintiff Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Co Ltd

(‘Mitsui’) and the Second Defendant Keppel Engineering Pte Ltd

(‘Keppel’) acting as a consortium, were contractors of a project with the First

Defendant PSA Corporation Limited (‘PSA’).

<p xmlns="">2.    There were two contracts between PSA on the one hand and Mitsui

and Keppel on the other hand i.e Contract Nos 619 and 801.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.    Under Contract No 619, the Consortium was required to carry out

the design, construction, supply, installation, testing, commissioning and integration of

an Overhead Bridge Crane System comprising 16 units of 40-tonne lifting container handling

overhead bridge cranes (‘cranes’) including superstructure and foundation for

the new container terminal at Pasir Panjang plus eight additional cranes at PSA’s

option.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    Under Contract No 801, the Consortium was required to carry out

the design, construction, supply, installation, testing, commissioning and integration of

16 cranes for the new container terminal at Pasir Panjang, including an option for eight

additional cranes (however, in the event, PSA only required the Consortium to supply a

total of 20 cranes under Contract No 801).</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    There were also two contracts as between Mitsui and Keppel each

dated 29 December 1997. These were referred to as Consortium Agreement Nos 619 and 801.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    Article 14 of the Consortium Agreements provides: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘All disputes arising in connection with the present Agreement

  shall be finally settled according to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules of 1976 which Rules

  are deemed to be incorporated in this Clause, by a sole arbitrator. The arbitration will

  be held in Singapore unless otherwise agreed.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">7.    At the time the present suit was filed, arbitration had already

commenced in which Keppel is the Claimant and Mitsui is the Respondent. The arbitration is

undertaken pursuant to arbitration provisions in each of the two Consortium Agreements.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    PSA is not a party to the Consortium Agreements. There is an

arbitration provision in Contract No 619 but not in Contract No 801, although both

contracts relate to the same project.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    In the present suit, Mitsui’s claims against PSA and Keppel

arise from both contracts. However, Keppel applied for a stay of the claims by Mitsui

against it in the suit in view of the arbitration provisions in the Consortium Agreements.

It was common ground that their disputes fell within such arbitration provisions.

Keppel’s application for a stay was granted by an Assistant Registrar. Mitsui then

appealed against the stay.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.    Keppel’s application was based on two grounds: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    if the International Arbitration Act

  (‘IAA’) applies to the arbitration, the stay is mandatory,</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    if the Arbitration Act applies, the stay is

  discretionary and the court should exercise its discretion in favour of a stay.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">11.    Mitsui did not dispute that if the IAA applies, the stay is

mandatory. Hence, the first and main argument was whether the IAA applies.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    Keppel contended that the arbitration was an international

arbitration for the purpose of the IAA on various grounds: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    Mitsui’s place of business was in Japan

  within the meaning of s 5(2)(a) read with s 5(3)(a) IAA,</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    alternatively, if Keppel’s and Mitsui’s

  places of business are considered to be in Singapore under s 5(2)(a) read with s 5(3)(a),

  a substantial part of the obligations of the commercial relationship was nevertheless to

  be performed by Mitsui in Japan and hence s 5(2)(b)(ii) IAA applies.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">13.    Mitsui contended that: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    its place of business was in Singapore, and not

  Japan under s 5(2)(a) and s 5(3)(a), and</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    as regards s 5(2)(b)(ii), both Keppel and Mitsui

  have their places of business in Singapore and no substantial part of the obligations of

  the commercial relationship is to be performed outside Singapore.</p>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">SECTION 5 IAA</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">14.    Section 5 IAA states: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘5.(1)    This Part and the Model Law shall not

  apply to an arbitration which is not an international arbitration unless the parties agree

  in writing that this Part of the Model Law shall apply to that arbitration.</p>
<p align="justify">(2)    Notwithstanding Article 1(3) of the Model Law, an

  arbitration is international if -</p>

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">WHETHER MITSUI’S PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN JAPAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF

S 5(2)(a) READ WITH S 5(3)(a)</p>
<p align="justify">The Arguments</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">15.    It was common ground that Mitsui is a company incorporated in

Japan and its head office is in Japan. It is also a foreign company registered in

Singapore with an office in Singapore for which it has a lease. Mitsui also alleged that

it manages and oversees projects in Singapore through its Singapore office.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    Hence, it was not disputed that Mitsui has a place of business in

Japan and a place of business in Singapore. This brought into play s 5(3)(a) which

required me to determine which of these two places of business ‘has the closest

relationship’ to the arbitration agreements.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    Mr Stephen Chong SC, Counsel for Keppel, submitted that it was

common ground that the closest relationship was to be determined with reference to the

negotiations leading to the Consortium Agreements which contained the arbitration

provisions. Therefore, the individuals who took part in the negotiations and the place of

the negotiations were important in this determination.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    Mr Chong referred to an Analytical Commentary on Draft Text of A

Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. Article 1(3) of the Draft Text is

similar to s 5(3)(a) and (b) IAA. With regard to ‘the closest relationship to the

arbitration agreement’, the Commentary states, at para 32: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘<u>Determination of place of business, paragraph (3)</u></p>
<p align="justify">32. If a party has two or more places of business, one of which is

  in the same State as is the other party’s place of business, it is necessary to

  determine which of his places is relevant for the purposes of paragraph (2). According to

  paragraph (3), first sentence, it is the one which has the closest relationship to the

  arbitration agreement. An instance of such close relationship would be that a contract,

  including an arbitration clause, is fully negotiated by the branch or office in question,

  even if it is signed at another place (e.g. the principal place of business).’</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">19.    As regards negotiations, Mr Chong submitted that: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    the main negotiator from Mitsui was Mr Shirai who

  was from Mitsui’s head office. The involvement of Mitsui’s personnel from its

  Singapore office was purely administrative and insignificant. They did not initiate any

  material change to terms during negotiations.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    The Consortium Agreements referred to Mitsui

  being a company incorporated under the laws in Japan and its head office’s address.

  Any formal communication thereunder was to be sent by Keppel to Mitsui in Japan. Much of

  the correspondence on negotiations were in fact sent to Mitsui’s head office.</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    There was a Portions List attached to each of the

  Consortium Agreements. The List sets out the respective party’s scope of work and

  purchasing of materials. The Mitsui representative responsible for the List was one Mr

  Ehira who is stationed in Japan.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">20.    Mr Leslie Chew SC, Counsel for Mitsui, submitted that the

following factors regarding the negotiations showed that Mitsui Singapore had the closest

relationship to the Consortium Agreements: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    Mr Shirai was not the only Mitsui negotiator. Mr

  Chew listed others some of whom had employment passes to work in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    The negotiations took place primarily in

  Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    The Portion Lists were negotiated primarily by

  Mitsui’s representatives in Singapore.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">21.    Mr Chew further submitted that I should also take into account

the following additional factors: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    the governing law of the arbitration is Singapore

  law,</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    the place of arbitration is Singapore,</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    the subject matter of the Consortium Agreement is

  in Singapore.</p>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">MY DECISION</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">22.    My initial view was that the place of substantial performance by

Mitsui should logically be an important factor in determining which place of business of

Mitsui had the closest relationship to the Consortium Agreements. By ‘the place of

substantial performance’ I mean the place where Mitsui’s main obligations were

to be carried out. However, my initial view was checked by two points.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    First, I noted that the Analytical Commentary did not refer

specifically to the place of substantial performance as a factor in determining the

closest relationship.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    Secondly, the place of substantial performance appeared to be

already specifically provided as one of the factors under s 5(2)(b)(ii). If this same

factor is already applicable under s 5(3)(a), then s 5(2)(b)(ii) would be otiose.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    However, upon further reflection, I was of the view that it was

not out of place to include the place of substantial performance by Mitsui as a factor in

determining which of its places of business has the closest relationship to the Consortium

Agreements.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    First, s 5(3)(a) does not specifically exclude the place of

substantial performance as a factor. Neither does the Analytical Commentary.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    Secondly, s 5(2)(b)(ii) refers to ‘<u>any</u> place where <u>a</u>

substantial part of the obligations of the commercial relationship is to be

performed’ (emphasis added) and not <u>the</u><i> </i>place of substantial

performance.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    Thus, for example, even if the place of substantial performance

by Mitsui were to be, say, Singapore, a substantial part of the performance by Mitsui

could still be in Japan. Conversely, if a substantial part of performance by Mitsui was in

Japan, it did not necessarily mean that Japan was the place of substantial performance by

Mitsui.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    Thirdly, s 5(3)(a) refers to the closest relationship of a party

to the arbitration agreement where that party has more than one place of business. The

substantial performance must be of that party before it is taken into account as a factor

in determining which place of business of that party has the closest relationship to the

arbitration agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    This can be contrasted with s 5(2)(b)(ii). The reference therein

to the performance of ‘a substantial part of the obligations’ is not confined to

performance by a party to the arbitration agreement. It can be performance by a non-party

for a party so long as that performance constitutes a substantial part of the obligations

undertaken under the contract in dispute. Thus, the Analytical Commentary states, at para

29: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘29. Under sub-paragraph (ii), internationality is established if

  a substantial part of the obligations of the commercial relationship is to be performed in

  a State other than the one where the parties have their places of business. This would be

  the case, for example, where a producer and a trader conclude a sole distributorship

  agreement concerning a foreign market or where a general contractor employs an independent

  sub-contractor for certain parts of a foreign construction project. While the arbitration

  agreement must cover any dispute or certain disputes arising out of this relationship, it

  is not necessary that the dispute itself relates to the international element.’</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">31.    This is illustrated in the Hong Kong case of <i>Fung Sang Trading

Ltd v Kai Sun Sea Products &amp; Food Co Ltd</i>. There, two Hong Kong companies with

their places of business in Hong Kong, entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase

of Chinese soybean FOB Dalian, China. The place of delivery was stated to be Dalian,

China, and payment by letters of credit through a Hong Kong bank. The document provided

for arbitration in Hong Kong under the laws of Hong Kong. One of the issues was whether

the arbitration was an international or domestic one.</p>
<p xmlns="">32.    The plaintiff there argued that as a substantial part of the

commercial obligations between it and the defendant was to be performed in China (delivery

of the goods), the dispute was an international arbitration to which the UNCITRAL Model

Law applied. The defendant argued that the arbitration was a domestic one because of

various factors: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    Both parties were Hong Kong companies.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    The defendant’s failure to nominate a vessel

  occurred in Hong Kong.</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    Acceptance of repudiation occurred in Hong Kong.</p>
<p align="justify">(d)    The commercial relationship commenced in Hong

  Kong in that the contract was made there.</p>
<p align="justify">(e)    The plaintiff was to cause its head supplier to

  deliver the cargo at Dalian. Thus causation was in Hong Kong. </p>
<p align="justify">(f)    The defendant failed to open a letter of credit

  in Hong Kong.</p>
<p align="justify">(g)    Hong Kong law would seem to be the applicable law

  of the contract.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">33.    Justice Kaplan of the Hong Kong High Court, in dealing with the

equivalent of s 5(2)(b)(ii) said: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘The definition refers to ‘substantial part of the

  obligation’. What is meant by substantial? In Hong Kong Arbitration - Cases and

  Materials (Butterworths, 1991), one finds the following at p 180: ‘Substantial’

  means ‘considerable’, ‘solid’ or ‘big’. In one case, a

  substantial amount was held to be 13 out of 80 but it will be dangerous to try to apply

  any mathematical formula. In one case, it was held that 1,000 firms out of 6,000, and

  150,000 employees out of 474,000 were not insubstantial and, therefore, substantial. (<i>Thorneloe

  v Board of Trade</i> [1950] 2 All ER 245).’</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">34.    He then concluded that, ‘a substantial part of the

obligations of the commercial relationship’ was to be performed in a place where the

parties did not have their places of business, i.e China and that the arbitration was an

international arbitration to which the Model Law did apply.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    Fourthly, there is some support for my view in another commentary

i.e Avon Broches’ Commentary on the Uncitral Model Law on International Commercial

Arbitration published by Kluwer. There, Article 1(4)(a) of the UNCITRAL Model Law is

similar to our s 5(3)(a). Page 7, para 26, of this commentary states: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘26. The Law deals in subparagraph (4)(a) with the case in which a

  party has more than one place of business, and in (4)(b) with the rare case in which a

  party has no place of business. Divergent views were expressed in the Working Group with

  respect of what became (4)(a). Some felt that where a party had more than one place of

  business, its principal place of business should be regarded as its place of business for

  the application of subparagraph (3), since this would provide a clear criterion. The

  prevailing view in the Working Group was, however, in favour of the place of business

  which has the closest relationship to the arbitration agreement, a criterion which was

  similar to Art. 10(a) of the 1980 Vienna Sales Convention. The relationship between a

  place of business and an arbitration agreement is not a very clear concept. It should

  probably be understood as meaning, or at least including, <u>the implementation of the

  agreement</u> and the subject matter of the dispute.</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">36.    In the context of Mr Chong’s argument in respect of s

5(2)(b)(ii), he stressed that Mitsui’s primary obligation was the design of the

cranes and this was to be done in Japan, although he did not dispute that there would be

other work done by Mitsui in Singapore.</p>
<p xmlns="">37.    Mr Chew did not dispute that the design would be done by Mitsui

in Japan. However he argued that the place of substantial performance of the contract with

PSA is Singapore. The fabrication and assembly works were carried out in Keppel’s

factory in Tuas, Singapore, and the automation works, after installation onto concrete

structures, were carried out substantially in Singapore.</p>
<p xmlns="">38.    I was of the view that the place of substantial performance by

Mitsui was Japan as its main responsibility was the design works.</p>
<p xmlns="">39.    As for the negotiations, I was of the view that it was the head

office’s Mr Shirai who was in charge of negotiations. It is who is in charge of

negotiations and not the number of people involved in the negotiations that is important.

The place of negotiations and execution of the Consortium Agreements is less important

given that Mr Shirai had from time to time flown from Japan to Singapore. I also took into

account the fact that Mitsui’s address in Japan, and not in Singapore, was used for

the Consortium Agreements and, more importantly, that any formal communication to Mitsui

was to be sent to its head office. As for the Portion Lists, they were negotiated

primarily in Singapore but Mr Ehira from the head office of Mitsui was the representative

in charge of the Lists.</p>
<p xmlns="">40.    The fact that the governing law is Singapore law and the place of

arbitration is Singapore is irrelevant. The question is not which place has the closest

relationship to the Consortium Agreements but which place <u>of business of Mitsui</u> has

the closest relationship to the Consortium Agreements.</p>
<p xmlns="">41.    Accordingly, I was of the view that Mitsui’s Japanese place

of business and not the Singapore one has the closest relationship to the Consortium

Agreements.</p>
<p xmlns="">42.    I would add that even if I were wrong in taking into account the

place of substantial performance by Mitsui, I would still have reached the same conclusion

based on the other factors which I have mentioned in para 39 above.</p>
<p xmlns="">43.    Accordingly, the arbitration was an international arbitration

under s 5(2)(a) read with s 5(3)(a) and the stay of Mitsui’s claims in court against

Keppel was mandatory.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">SECTION 5(2)(b)(ii) IAA</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">44.    As for s 5(2)(b)(ii), it applies where a substantial part of the

obligations is to be performed in a place outside the State in which the parties have

their place of business.</p>
<p xmlns="">45.    Therefore, even if I had concluded that Mitsui’s place of

business was Singapore under s 5(2)(a) read with s 5(3)(a), and since Keppel’s place

of business was also in Singapore, it was still open to Keppel to argue that the

arbitration was an international one under s 5(2)(b)(ii). Indeed it did rely on s

5(2)(b)(ii) as its alternative argument.</p>
<p xmlns="">46.    As I was of the view that Mitsui’s substantial performance

of its obligations was in Japan, it would follow that the arbitration between Mitsui and

Keppel was an international one under s 5(2)(b)(ii), if not under s 5(2)(a) read with s

5(3)(a).</p>
<p xmlns="">47.    The factors which Mr Chew mentioned like the fabrication and

assembly works and the installation works only showed that the place of substantial

performance of the entire contract with PSA was in Singapore but that was a different

matter altogether. The question was whether ‘<u>any</u> place where <u>a</u>

substantial part of the obligations …’ [emphasis added] is performed is a place

outside the State in which the parties have their place of business.</p>

<p align="justify">CONDUCT OF THE PARTIES</p>

<p xmlns="">48.    Mr Chong also drew my attention to the conduct of the parties and

the conduct of the arbitration proceedings so far between Mitsui and Keppel, for example: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    n a letter dated 2 May 2001 from Khattar Wong

  &amp; Partners (‘KWP’), the solicitors of Mitsui, to the Hong Kong International

  Arbitration Centre, KWP requested an arbitrator who was neither Japanese nor Singaporean,

  ‘as the dispute is between a Japanese company and a Singaporean company’. While

  this was a fact, Mr Chong submitted that it illustrated the international nature of the

  dispute.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    In a preliminary hearing in Singapore on 27 June

  2001, the arbitrator requested for a copy of the relevant Singapore statute i.e the IAA,

  which Keppel undertook to provide. There was then no suggestion by Mitsui that the

  relevant statute was the Arbitration Act instead.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">49.    I was of the view that the second point would have militated

against Mitsui’s belated argument that the arbitration was not an international one.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">SUMMARY</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">50.    In the circumstances, the IAA applied. As the Arbitration Act did

not apply, it was not necessary for me to decide whether I should exercise my discretion

not to order a stay of Mitsui’s claims against Keppel in the suit.</p>
<p xmlns="">51.    Accordingly, I dismissed Mitsui’s appeal with costs.</p>
