Kasha (“Walter”), does not feature in the evidence but nothing turns on that. The Ethocyn compound had to be manufactured or synthesized in a laboratory. It was a skin product that was said to make the skin look younger and better toned. There was a finished product sold over the counter or through other channels like television and telemarketing. The Ethocyn compound was also sold to cosmetic manufacturers who would incorporate this compound into their products.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Chantal was a gifted individual.

It was alleged that Chantal sold at least 300,000 of her stock for at least US$6.3 million. It is alleged that, because of these false statements, the stock rose from “$6-9/16 on July 10, 1995 to $28-1/8 on December 29, 1995” but when certain reports concerning its financial condition surfaced, the stock fell from “$19-1/8 per share to $7-5/16 per share on January 8, 1996 on a huge volume of 7.7 million shares”.

When the Ethocyn Rights were being sold to Renslade (NZ), the class action suit was still ongoing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On 21 May 2001, counsel for the class action suit proposed a settlement of the same. Counsel had concluded that Chantal and Chantal Pharmaceutical would be unable to satisfy any money judgment as Chantal had no significant assets and Chantal Pharmaceutical was undergoing insolvency proceedings. As part of the settlement agreement, Chantal had stated that her net worth was less than US$350,000 and agreed to deliver detailed financial information to prove the same. The settlement was approved by the court on 31 July 2001.

Not surprisingly, counsel for the plaintiff and the defendants, Mr Cavinder Bull SC and Mr Alvin Yeo SC respectively, gave different emphases to the tests that should be applied when a defendant elects not to call evidence and submits that there is no case to answer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi v Yeap Cheen Soo</span> [2015] 1 SLR 581 (“<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span>”) ruled that where there is a submission of no case to answer, the test is whether the plaintiff’s evidence at face value establishes no case in law or whether the evidence led by the plaintiff is so unsatisfactory or unreliable that its burden of proof has not been discharged (at [23]). The threshold against which the claims are to be assessed is that of whether the plaintiff has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the defendant, and the plaintiff need not prove his case on a balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span> at [24], citing <span class="font-italic">Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd and others</span> [2012] 2 SLR 549 at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In assessing whether the plaintiff has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case, the court will assume that any evidence led by the Appellant was true unless it was inherently incredible or outside of common sense. Where circumstantial evidence is relied on, it need not give rise to an irresistible inference as long as the desired inference is one of the possible inferences (<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span> at [24], citing <span class="font-italic">Relfo Ltd (in liquidation) v Bhimji Velji Jadva Varsan</span><span class="font-italic">i</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 657 (“<span class="font-italic">Relfo</span>”) at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 These tests have been authoritatively set out in <span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span> and we do not understand how Mr Bull SC or Mr Yeo SC can submit otherwise. However, when those principles are applied to the facts before us, there are nuances and allied principles which come into play: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Yeo SC is quite correct to say that he can test the Estate’s evidence to see if they do indeed establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case. For example, Mr Yeo SC submits that the Estate has no evidence – besides an allegation by Baker – to show that the Ethocyn Rights were assigned from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S) for no consideration, and Baker was not even privy to or possessed with personal knowledge of the events then. In a sense, the Estate has to prove a negative. Instead, Mr Yeo SC submits that the available evidence – a Deed of Assignment – although backdated, does recite that it was assigned for value (see <span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span> at [25], citing <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004 at [210]). Whether that takes the Defendants beyond the gates will be examined below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Yeo SC is also entitled to submit that even if the Estate has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, the trust was illegal or not enforceable as being tainted with illegality.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Bull SC on the other hand can legitimately submit that if circumstantial evidence is relied upon, it does not have to give rise to an irresistible inference as long as the desired inference is one the possible inferences (see <span class="font-italic">Lena </span><span class="font-italic">Leowardi</span> at [24], citing <span class="font-italic">Rel</span><span class="font-italic">fo </span>at [20]); and so long as that evidence and inference is not inherently incredible or outside of common sense, the court will assume it is true.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Mr Bull SC is also entitled to emphasize that, if the Estate makes out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case and the Defendants choose not to call evidence and submit that there is no case to answer, then, bearing in mind the above principles, the failure to offer evidence could be fatal to the defendants’ case (see <span class="font-italic">Thio Keng Poon v Thio Syn Pyn and </span><span class="font-italic">others and another appeal</span> [2010] 3 SLR 143 at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) It is correct that no adverse inference ought to be drawn by a defendant’s making of a submission of no case to answer. However, if a court were to look at a particular email or letter authored by the defendant and its contents can be fairly said to point to the existence of certain facts that satisfy the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> test, but the court does not have the benefit of an explanation from the defendant that that was not what the defendant meant, the plaintiff’s construction of the particular email or letter would prevail.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) We also note that a number of Chantal’s emails, facsimiles and documents are cryptic. She is no longer around to explain them or to fill any gaps that exist. Baker may tell us what he thinks it means, either from what Chantal may have told him whilst she was alive or from what he knows or concludes by going through her many documents. What weight we give to his evidence must be carefully calibrated when applying the tests enumerated above.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Similarly there are emails and facsimiles from one Christine Yong (“Christine”) and one Hartono, who were employees of the Defendants, to Chantal or other persons.

There was evidence, and we so find, that there were quite a large number of affected stockholders and creditors, some of whom had lost significant amounts of money. In a second application filed on 3 November 1999 by Chantal Companies’ counsel in the US Bankruptcy Court for an interim payment of their fees and disbursement, they state that they answered numerous telephone calls from the 1,500 creditors and over 1,750 stockholders and added that “[u]nfortunately, many people have lost significant amounts of money and it would be inappropriate to ignore their telephone calls…”.

</div> There was some evidence, described as <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence by Mr Bull SC, that there were such death threats. In her AEIC, Heika, who was 12 years’ old at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings, remembered that her mother received death threats and became fearful for their safety. Heika deposes that her mother changed their residence to her grandfather’s house, diverted all her mail there and hired a bodyguard to protect her and Birka. Heika exhibited a picture of herself and a man, who she claimed to be her bodyguard.

All Baker was cross-examined on was that Chantal could not have been fearful of death threats so many years later (in 2010, 2011, 2013 or 2014) and that these death threats were a cover to explain the inconsistencies in the documents.

</div>
</div> We should point out two things. First, other than bare statements, albeit on oath, we have no evidence at all as to the nature of or form of these death threats, whether by telephone calls or anonymous notes or letters in the post. Secondly, we would have expected that with death threats of a serious nature, some reports would have been made to the police. There was however, no such evidence. Nevertheless, this court has to assume that the evidence led by the Estate is true unless it was inherently incredible or outside of common sense (<span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span> at [24]). In this case, that Chantal received death threats from disgruntled shareholders or creditors who had lost significant amounts of money is one of the <span class="font-italic">possible inference</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> of the circumstantial evidence and we accordingly accept that to be the case. Had Weber come to trial to challenge Baker’s evidence on this, for example, by testifying that Chantal had never told him of any death threats, we may well find otherwise. In any event, the issue of whether Chantal actually received death threats is not a pleaded issue and should not be of disproportionate significance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 We also think it more likely than not that Chantal believed in her own product or invention and needed to put her and her companies’ financial problems behind her so that she could exploit her invention to its full potential. If the Creditors’ Committee knew she was interested in buying the Ethocyn Rights, they were likely to have tried to extract a higher price; whether they could succeed or not is an entirely different matter and there is no direct evidence on this. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with or exceptional in a debtor wanting to purchase its own assets, but there certainly would have been heightened scrutiny of the sale and accompanying agreements if this had been made known. We think Chantal also had an interest in securing the Ethocyn Rights free and clear of all claims, liens and encumbrances as well as settling the Class Action suit against her. Chantal also wanted to move the Ethocyn Rights offshore to maintain opacity as to its ownership and to take advantage of more favourable tax regimes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 We find that the Estate has made out its case that Chantal was responsible for deciding upon a New Zealand corporation to purchase the Ethocyn Rights. There was ample evidence on this score. Pursuant to her decision, Chantal instructed Weir, a lawyer practising in Hong Kong, to use a company in New Zealand and this resulted in the acquisition of a shelf company, which was re-named Renslade (NZ). Chantal’s business activities had hitherto, and we say unsurprisingly, not been confined to the USA. It is stated in the draft prospectus prepared to attract bids, which we accept, that in 1995 the Chantal Companies entered into additional distribution agreements with a Hong Kong company for the Pacific Rim;

</div> For the foregoing reasons, we find that Baker has shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that Legendary loaned US$750,000 to Renslade (NZ) to bid for the Ethocyn Rights. Our finding in this regard is further supported by the fact that the Handwritten Chronology, specifically listed in chronological order, first, a transfer of $800,000 to P F Wong, and then the loan of $775,000 from P F Wong to Legendary, and then “Oct 19, 1999[,] [Renslade (NZ)] purchases assets (<span class="font-italic">intellectual property</span> …) for $325,000”. Being listed in a single chronology, we find that the payment of US$325,000 by Renslade (NZ) for the purchase of the Ethocyn Rights in the US Bankruptcy Proceedings came from the loan of US$775,000 from P F Wong to Legendary, which in turn, loaned the same to Renslade (NZ).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Although Baker did not adduce evidence showing the direct transfer of funds from Legendary to Renslade (NZ), the evidence establishes, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis, that Chantal had provided the funds for Renslade (NZ)’s purchase of the Ethocyn Rights. The Defendants, save for highlighting arithmetical inconsistency and challenging the authenticity of the Handwritten Chronology, did not proffer any alternative explanation for the movement of funds. Further, the arithmetical inconsistencies were not, by far, of the magnitude that made them incredible or inherently unbelievable or outside of common sense. There were obviously (and there are references to these items in the documents before us) payments to lawyers, purchases of Ethocyn, as well as some earnings from sales transactions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There were no other bidders for the Ethocyn Rights and assets of the Chantal Companies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As we observed to counsel during closing submissions, it is of some importance to note that the Ethocyn Rights and assets were not an off-the-shelf machinery or product, nor was it like a piece of land or a building. The Ethocyn Rights were comprised in intellectual property which did not have a long shelf life and the last of the patents would expire in 2004. Further, from the draft prospectus, it recites that the Chantal Companies’ laboratory in Germany had closed down. Any further exploitation involved setting up another laboratory to synthesize the Ethocyn compound. There is evidence of Chantal exploring this in November 1999.

</div> The existing stocks of Ethocyn compound had degraded somewhat, although it appears they could be salvaged. Also, to properly exploit these rights, investments had to be made. The prospectus mentions at least US$1 million in the initial investment. Further, even if a purchaser had the marketing ability and knowledge of the cosmetics industry, without someone with the knowhow to direct and supervise a laboratory to synthesize the Ethocyn compound, its true value is unascertainable and cannot be captured if there was no one to oversee the production and marketing of the Ethocyn compound. There was also a need in the longer term for further research as the last of the patents expired in 2004. We will return to these factors when we consider the statements made by Chantal to the US Bankruptcy Courts and the issues of illegality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Although not surfaced by counsel, it appears, and we so find, that Renslade (NZ) had made a first offer, earlier on in the Chapter 11 proceedings, on behalf of “investors from Hong Kong”, of US$500,000 cash payment plus royalties to purchase the Ethocyn Rights, but this was rejected by the Creditors’ Committee. This appears in the second application by counsel for the Chantal Companies, Messrs Peitzman, Glassman &amp; Weg, to the US Bankruptcy on 23 November 1999 for payment of their fees referred to above.

</div> In their application, they state that, after the rejection of Renslade (NZ)’s offer, they then had to work independently with the Creditors’ Committees’ investment banker, the Kriegsman Group, to find another buyer. Counsel assisted the Kriegsman Group in preparation of the “book” on the debtors and their rights and assets and spoke to several interested parties. However, no one was willing to make a written offer to purchase the Chantal Companies’ rights and assets. They state: “After several weeks went by without any new prospective purchaser appearing on the scene, [the Applicant] initiated a new negotiation with Shane Weir in Hong Kong.”

In all the documentary evidence reviewed so far, Weber is not mentioned. The documentary evidence shows Chantal liaising fairly intensely with the lawyers and advisers mentioned and this included the running of the business, dealing with the shipments of goods and products, accounts and payments and organisational issues like having a director, Carrie Chan, in Hong Kong to deal with emergencies like another company attempting to register the trademark “Ethocyn” in China.

</div>
</div>
</div> We note an earlier version of the Statement of Claim and further and better particulars furnished therein gave the date of this meeting as being in or around February 1999. However the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2) was amended in July 2018 to the aforesaid date. By an assignment dated 24 May 2000, Chantal procured the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S), a company incorporated in Singapore on or around 23 May 2000. Weber was the sole shareholder of Renslade (S). By a deed dated 1 April 2002, Weber procured the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (S) to BCS and BCS became the trustee of the express trust. This deed was assigned shortly after BCS’s name change on 26 July 2002 and backdated to 1 April 2002.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Defendants deny that there was an agreement of any kind between Chantal and Weber for the latter to acquire and hold the Ethocyn Rights and any income and/or proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights on trust for Chantal. Renslade (S), a company controlled by Weber, acquired the Ethocyn Rights and assets from Renslade (NZ) for the sum of US$325,000 and the purchase price was paid for by BCS with monies that belonged to BCS and/or Weber and were not provided for by Chantal. Weber decided on the purchase because he saw an opportunity to exploit the Ethocyn Rights and assets through a business deal with Nu Skin. Weber had to transfer the Ethocyn Rights to BCS, which was an active company with several business streams, to secure the business with Nu Skin. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 It is not disputed that Renslade (NZ) transferred the Ethocyn Rights to Renslade (S). As we set out the events that led to the transfer, it will be evident, and we so find, that it was Chantal who spearheaded and made key decisions in relation to the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S). We find that Weber, contrary to the Defendants’ case as set out above, was in fact working for Chantal as her business advisor and followed her instructions in all matters. We reject Weber’s case that he purchased the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) for his own investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The documentary evidence shows that Chantal already had a working relationship with Wehinger from as early as 10 August 1989. This is evident from a copy of a distribution agreement between Chantal Pharmaceutical Corporation and private investors, the latter being represented by Wehinger.

First, Chantal knew Weber prior to 1999. In a declaration filed by Wehinger in US proceedings dated 17 September 2018, Wehinger confirmed that he did refer Weber to Chantal.

</div> Secondly, in a chronology prepared by Chantal, she recorded that she moved the Ethocyn Business in <span class="font-italic">December</span> 1999 from Hong Kong to Singapore for tax reasons.

</div> This is consistent with the fact that Chantal and Weber entered into the Trust Agreement in November 1999, <span class="font-italic">before</span> Chantal actually moved the Ethocyn Business to Singapore one month later. Thirdly, there was also an email from Chantal to Noel Conway on 5 March 2000. In this email, Chantal referred to a “Chinese lady” in the “Orient”, presumably Christine, and mentioned that she wished for Christine’s attorneys to handle the transactions with Colin Beyer in New Zealand in relation to the transfer of the Ethocyn Business from New Zealand to Singapore, as she wanted her “Swiss relationship to remain confidential”. It is reasonable for us to presume, that this “Swiss relationship” refers to Chantal’s relationship with Weber.  Last, and as we have pointed out above at [99], it is clear from the 9 March 2000 Email that Weber was already known to Chantal then, and they already had prior discussions in relation to the Ethocyn Business. Therefore, Weber’s claim in his AEIC (which was not admitted as evidence at the trial) that he met Chantal for <span class="font-italic">the first time in 2000</span> cannot be true.

</div> As regards the date at which Chantal and Weber entered into the Trust Agreement, we find that the Estate has proved on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis that this was entered into in November 1999.

Chantal ended the facsimile by thanking Weber for “all [his] efforts, accomplishments, and work product for the many subjects and files”.

</div> It should be noted that previously, Weber informed Chantal (see [106] above) that the beneficial owner could be “Lalaine” or if she liked, BCS. This is not inconsistent with Chantal’s email to Weber on 10 May 2000, where Chantal mentioned that the owner could be “Lalaine” or whoever Weber nominates. Chantal was simply giving Weber the option to choose who the owner of Renslade (S) should be. Weber responded to Chantal’s facsimile on 19 May 2000, but did not reply in relation to who the owner of Renslade (S) should be.

</div> The Estate has provided documents, including communications from Chantal to Weber and vice versa, to prove their case. In none of the above contemporaneous documents is there any hint of Chantal wanting to sell and Weber wanting and then deciding to buy the Ethocyn Rights.

Crucially, he did not depose that he paid US$350,000 for the purchase of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ). Weber did state that, after he acquired the Ethocyn Rights, he paid over US$120,000 to transport the manufacturing equipment from Hungary to the United States and took over the obligation to pay royalties to the Chantal Companies.

</div> As noted above, the correspondence, however, did not support the Defendants’ case at all. On the contrary, it was clear that Weber took Chantal’s instructions, and Chantal directed the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S) for nominal consideration. From the start (the email from Wehinger to Chantal on 3 March 2000), Wehinger told Chantal that both he and Weber will support <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">her business</span>. Throughout the correspondence between Chantal and Weber, Chantal thanked Weber repeatedly for his <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">assistance and consult</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ations</span>, and Weber (tele-facsimiled on 23 March 2000) acknowledged that he was working on Chantal’s files.

Baker’s pleaded case is that it was Chantal who provided the sums for the Royalty Buyout. On the contrary, the Defendants claim that it was BCS who provided these sums and not Chantal. As we set out the events that led to the Royalty Buyout, we find that the evidence supports Baker’s claim that, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis, it was Chantal who provided the US$135,000 for the Royalty Buyout.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 On 25 May 2000, Renslade (S) entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with BCS for the latter to distribute Ethocyn-related products (“BCS-Renslade Distribution Agreement”).

The documentary evidence set out above is consistent with their case. In addition we have the evidence of Baker and Heika. Bearing in mind the burden of proof and the tests to be applied (see [66] to [70] above), we accept the version put forward by the Estate and find not only that the Estate has made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case but also that the Defendants have not been able to discredit the witnesses under cross-examination or impugn the relevant documents and their contents as contended by the Estate. As noted previously, this is a case where Weber has chosen not to give evidence to explain why his emails and facsimiles should not be given their plain and natural meaning.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Finally, we add that there is sufficient <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence put forward by the Estate of how Nova Derm obtained the sum of USD$167,154.82 which it subsequently transferred to Renslade (S). On 19 April 2002, a sum of US$994,595.30 was transferred from one Chicago Title Insurance Company to Nova Derm Corporation’s bank account. Baker claims that this came from a loan of US$ 1 million which Chantal had taken out from Wells Fargo bank by way of a mortgage on her home at Sarbonne.

</div> At the trial, parties agreed that the Ethocyn Rights did not generate any significant income prior to the Nu Skin SDA. As such, the evidence does suggest that the US$ 1 million in Nova Derm Corporation’s bank account came from monies raised by the mortgage taken out by Chantal. Although the Defendants submit that Baker’s claim is baseless, they are unable to provide any documentary evidence nor any alternative explanation as to where the US$1 million in Nova Derm Corporation’s bank account could possibly have come from, given that it is also their claim that Nova Derm Corporation is BCS’s subsidiary.

The Estate’s case is that the Deed of Assignment was entered into around 26 July 2002 and backdated to 1 April 2002.

This is consistent with our findings at [145] below that Chantal was the driving force behind the Nu Skin negotiations. In an email from Chantal to Weber on 20 September 2002, Chantal updated Weber on her ongoing negotiations with Nu Skin and specifically mentioned that she wanted the Nu Skin SDA to be signed with BCS:

BCS paid E. Cosmetics Corporation and BCS Pharma Corporation to formulate and package Ethocyn products for Nu Skin. BCS and/or Renslade (HK) paid for the costs of producing the Ethocyn products and other expenses from the sums Nu Skin paid to BCS in advance.

It was for tax purposes that the profits generated from the Ethocyn products were transferred to Renslade (HK) in Hong Kong, and 5% (2007 to 2014) and 10% (from 2015) was retained by BCS in Singapore as distribution fee. Further, Chantal claimed costs on behalf of E. Cosmetics Corporation and/or BCS Pharma Corporation, which was higher than the actual costs incurred.

</div> Chantal was the one who updated BCS’s staff on the business development with Nu Skin and it was Chantal’s companies who manufactured and produced the Ethocyn products. At the trial, the Defendants did not challenge Chantal’s control over the Nu Skin business. There is no evidence that one would expect to find where the chief operations officer (“COO”) reports back to the owner on the significant stages of the Nu Skin SDA to obtain the owner’s agreement. Chantal made the decisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Secondly, Chantal would reimburse Weber for his out-of-pocket expenses that he incurred for the Ethocyn business. For example, on 16 August 2000 (before the Nu Skin SDA), Weber emailed Chantal requesting payments for (a) royalties, (b) invoices by other companies for business related expenses and (c) “invoice for [his] services”.

</div> Having reviewed the documents, we find that Chantal indeed classified these transfer of monies (except the one-off request for medical expenses above) for the purposes of operating costs and production. In short, Chantal <span class="font-italic">directed </span>the transfer of the alleged Trust Monies to various entities and stated that these transfers were for operating expenses and costs related to the Ethocyn business. We also find that Chantal did, in a few instances, provide justifications for these transfers. For example, on 17 August 2009, Chantal requested a transfer of US$200,000 and explained that “[t]his amount is higher than usual request due to a combined payment for [Ethocyn] clinical trials in progress and the forthcoming Nu Skin compound production”.

It is not unknown for businessmen to classify payments received under one ledger or category or another, whether for tax or accounting reasons. Suffice to say, at this stage, the documentary evidence supports our finding that Chantal <span class="font-italic">directed</span> the transfer of funds, and these were <span class="font-italic">largely done without question</span>. The Estate has given an explanation and reasons that, again, are not inherently incredible or unbelievable.

At the meeting, Weber and Wehinger also showed Heika the Regulations of the Foundation, which they explained was a “draft of the rules and regulations … that would govern how they would manage [Chantal’s] assets and monies, and after her passing, for [Heika] and Birka”.

The reasonable inference that we draw from the conversation between Wehinger and Heika supports Baker’s case that Weber had all along acted as a fiduciary for Chantal and the May and July 2016 Meetings were for the purposes of discussing how to return the alleged Trust Assets/Monies back to Chantal and her daughters, though the Foundation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 At the trial, Mr Yeo SC put to Baker and Heika that the amended regulations of the Foundation stated that Weber would be the first beneficiary to the Foundation’s assets and revenue, with Heika and Birka only becoming the second beneficiaries after Weber’s death.

</div> This was confirmed by Heika in her AEIC. Heika explained in her AEIC that the Irish company would purchase all the alleged Trust Assets and Trust Monies from the Defendants. The Irish company was to be structured in a manner where Heika and Birka would each hold 45% of the shares, while Weber held the remaining 10%. Heika said that the reason for Weber holding 10% of the shares was that it would have been strange had Weber not controlled at least a small portion, given that he had controlled everything up to this stage. This was also consistent with Weber wishing to increase his commission under the Nu Skin SDA from 5% to 10%. Heika also claimed that, eventually, Weber’s interest would be “taken out” after the Irish company has acquired all the alleged Trust Assets and Trust Monies.

What we find is that, first, the Defendants intended to set up the Foundation for the purpose of transferring the Trust Assets back to the Estate. The regulations of the Foundation were also amended for Weber to be the first beneficiary such that he can represent himself as having title of the assets to the banks. Subsequently, the Defendants considered the use of an Irish company instead of the Foundation to protect Weber from potential tax liabilities. Johnson <span class="font-italic">only came in</span> at this stage of the discussion and, as such, was understandably unfamiliar with the background of the Ethocyn business. In any event, and as we have repeatedly mentioned, Weber did not come to trial to explain his version of events as to whether the valuation was indeed only a façade for him to avoid potential tax liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 More importantly, we find the Skype Conversation to be consistent with the Estate’s case. In the Skype Conversation, Wehinger confirmed that the Defendants proposed the incorporation of a new company in Ireland to hold the alleged Trust Assets for Heika and Birka. In the Skype Conversation, Wehinger mentioned that Heika and Birka will become the “beneficial owners”:

</div> This was not done. On 20 November 2017, Baker commenced the Suit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary and answers to some of the Agreed Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 In summary, we find that Baker has established, at least, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis (and on some of its constituent aspects, more than a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case) the existence of an oral Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber on the terms as set out at [22] above. The evidence throughout each stage of the development of the Ethocyn business, to the date of Chantal’s death and beyond, points to the same conclusion that Chantal had always been the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights, the Trust Monies and the Trust Assets. Weber had always been working for Chantal and was obliged to account to Chantal in relation to the Trust Monies and Trust Assets. We also find that many of the agreements and corporate structures were structured in a specific manner to maintain opacity of beneficial ownership and to avoid tax liabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Having considered the evidence and our findings made above, our answers to the Agreed Issues covered so far (see [59] above) are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) We find there was a Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber as pleaded in paras 13 and 14 of the Estate’s Statement of Claim. The terms are as set out in paras 13 and 14 of the Estate’s Statement of Claim and [22] above.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Trust Agreement was reached sometime between November 1999 and 3 March 2000 between Chantal and Weber and the trust was constituted on or about the 24 May 2000 when the Ethocyn Rights were assigned or transferred from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Yes, Renslade (NZ) held the Ethocyn Rights on trust for Chantal until they were assigned or transferred to Renslade (S).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Chantal provided the funds, if any, for Renslade (S) to acquire the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ); insofar as there were any funds required by Renslade (S) to acquire the Ethocyn Rights, whether through the assumption of ongoing obligations and royalty payments or for a nominal $1 or otherwise, it was provided by Chantal or through the US Corporations managed or owned by Chantal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Renslade (NZ) and subsequently Renslade (S) acquired legal ownership of the Ethocyn Rights and assets by the Royalty Buyout in or around July 2002. Chantal was always the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(k) The retention of 5% of the proceeds (and, subsequently, subject to (m) below,  10% of the proceeds) by BCS from the sale of the Ethocyn Products pursuant to the Nu Skin SDA and other similar agreements, if any, was commission or remuneration for Weber and the 1st and 2nd Defendants under the Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(l) BCS and/or Renslade (HK) transferred monies to Chantal, entities controlled by Chantal, and entities involved in the production or marketing of Ethocyn products or the protection of the Ethocyn Rights for their expenses or costs as well as monies for Chantal’s use as she was the beneficial owner of these Trust Monies.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(o) Yes, Chantal, Baker and Heika sought an account of the Trust Monies and assets pursuant to the Trust Agreement from Weber from May 2016 after Chantal was diagnosed with metastic colon cancer.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(p) In the July 2016 Meeting, Wehinger and Weber proposed the transfer of the Trust Assets/Monies from BCS and Renslade (HK) to the Estate through the Foundation. At this meeting, Weber also showed Heika the July 2016 Summary and the Cash Flow Statement. In the 12 December 2016 Meeting, the Defendants proposed the transfer of the Trust Assets/Monies from BCS and Renslade (HK) to the Estate via an Irish company instead of the Foundation. This was done for the purpose of protecting Weber from potential tax liabilities. The Irish company was to be structured in a way where Heika and Birka would each hold 45% of the shares in the Irish company, while Weber would hold the remaining 10%. After the Trust Assets/Monies were transferred, Weber’s interest would be “taken out”, though the exact mechanics of this were not discussed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(q) There was an agreement at the 12 December 2016 Meeting for the Defendants to transfer the Trust Assets and/or Trust Monies to Chantal’s Estate via an Irish company as set out at (p) above. This was however not done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Although parties have also put forth a list of additional issues which are not agreed, where relevant, we have dealt with it in our findings of facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Weber's 5% Commission</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 We now turn to the pleaded issue as to whether Weber unilaterally increased the commission due to him as a trustee under the Trust Agreement from 5% to 10% without Chantal’s knowledge and consent. We find this to be so. It was initially agreed between the parties that, under the Trust Agreement, Weber was to hold the Trust Assets on trust for Chantal, save for 5% of such income or proceeds as commission (see [22] above). From around 2007 to 2017, Nu Skin made payments under the Nu Skin SDA to BCS and 5% of these payments were retained as commission. In around 2016, the Defendants started retaining 10% of the monies paid by Nu Skin to BCS. Having found the existence of the Trust Agreement, we accept the Estate’s case that the payments made by Nu Skin constitute Trust Monies, 5% of which the Defendants were entitled to retain as commission. In addition, the documentary evidence shows that Chantal had <span class="font-italic">no knowledge</span> and <span class="font-italic">did not consent</span> to the Defendants (or Weber) increasing their commission from 5% to 10% from 2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 24 May 2016, Chantal emailed Weber and requested the Financial Records in relation to a 5% “agreed compensation” for services provided by Weber to her (see [159] above). If Chantal knew that Weber had increased the commission to 10%, she would have represented otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 9 June 2016, Chantal emailed Wehinger and informed him that the “agreement from the beginning in 1999 was 5% participation to singapore [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in gross singapore [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] managed funds” (see [169] above). Chantal did not mention that Weber had increased this commission to 10% as she was not aware of this fact at that time. This email was not challenged during cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There was an amendment agreement between BCS and Renslade (HK) where the “distribution fee” under cl 7.9 of the BCS-Renslade Distribution Agreement was increased from 5% to 10% on 2 January 2015 (see [140(a)] above). However, in the July 2016 Summary, the Defendants described the 5% retention by BCS Singapore as “Less 5% BCS commission (10% <span class="font-italic">since 2016</span>)”. The July 2016 Summary reflected the actual sums (and retention of commission) held by Renslade (HK) and we find that Weber unilaterally increased the commission due to him <span class="font-italic">from 2016</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Defendants did not adduce any evidence showing that Chantal knew that the commission was increased from 5% to 10%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 We will deal with the consequence of the Defendants (or Weber) increasing their commission from 5% to 10% unilaterally without Chantal’s knowledge or consent <span class="font-italic">after </span>we analyse whether the Trust is valid and enforceable under Singapore or Californian law. We will also deal with the remedies at the appropriate juncture. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The CHF9.5 million “loan”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 We now turn to the discrete issue of the CHF9.5 million loan. To recapitulate the parties’ respective cases:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Estate alleges that, sometime in or around 2014, Weber asked Chantal for a loan of CHF6 million so that he could invest in a ski resort. Weber agreed to pay 3% interest on the loan. Chantal agreed. In or around 2015, Chantal discovered that Weber had instead taken CHF9.5 million from the Trust Monies. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Defendants deny there was any Trust Agreement. Weber purchased the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) as his own investment; the Defendants allege that the CHF9.5 million was part of the proceeds generated by the Nu Skin SDA and were invested in bonds by Weber, dealing with his own monies, as the controlling shareholder of Renslade (S), on behalf of the Renslade (S).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 We have found that the Estate has succeeded in establishing the Trust Agreement as pleaded and one of the terms was that Weber was entitled to retain 5% of the income or proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights as his commission or remuneration. We have also found that, from 2016, Weber started retaining 10% of the income or proceeds without informing Chantal or otherwise obtaining her consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 We find that the Estate has established its case that Weber asked Chantal for a 3-year loan of CHF6 million to invest in a ski resort he was interested in and Weber agreed to pay 3% interest. In an email dated 4 August 2014, Chantal asked Weber for the balance remaining in the account regarding the Nu Skin SDA monies received in 2013 and 2014. Chantal also referred to the loan as follows:

</div> Baker strenuously denied this and we accept his evidence, not least of all because, in 2014, Chantal had yet to be diagnosed with cancer and no disputes had arisen between Chantal and Weber. Further, Mr Yeo SC’s construction of this email exchange goes beyond the language used by the parties in this exchange of emails. In the email, Chantal told Weber that she wished the loan to be reduced from CHF9 million to CHF6 million because she <span class="font-italic">w</span><span class="font-italic">anted to make other investments</span>. There was no suggestion that such investments were on behalf of BCS or Renslade (HK), and Weber merely responded that he could arrange it all. This goes against the Defendants’ claim that Weber was in fact dealing with his own monies. Again, Weber has chosen not to give evidence of possible background and a possible explanation as to why he sent the emails in the language that he did. We also note that this was not even something addressed in his unadmitted AEIC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Some nine months later on 22 May 2015, Chantal had forwarded Weber’s email dated 5 August 2014 to him. Chantal complained in the subject header of the email that: “Marcus email to me last August. Took 9.2 mill sFR on June 30, 2014. Repayment is at 3% interest (hope it is per year and not over the three years!) and plans to repay June 30, 2017. I thought he said $6million. Am not happy.”

Chantal had acceded to Weber’s request. However, Weber, without Chantal’s knowledge or consent, took more than the agreed amount, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, CHF9.5 million from the profits made under the Nu Skin SDA, and has not repaid that loan or, it appears, subject to any rendering of accounts, any interest, to date.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The governing law of the Trust Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 We now turn to the law applicable to determine the validity of the Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber. The law of the forum supplies the choice of law rules to determine the substantive law to apply to resolve the dispute between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> Volume 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span>”) at para 75.273), and so Singapore’s choice of law rules determine whether Singapore law or California law applies. The first step in the choice of law analysis is characterisation, also known as classification (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s </span>at 75.252). This involves characterisation of the legal issue, as the applicable choice of law rules are determined by the issue in the case (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s </span>at 75.253).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legal nature of the Trust Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The Estate’s pleaded case on the Trust Agreement and our findings have already been set out above. We have found that the Estate has made out its case of an express oral trust, and we now apply the choice of law rules that apply to trusts to ascertain the governing law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 We make it clear that this finding of a valid trust is a tentative conclusion. Knowing whether, under the Trust Agreement, Chantal had the intention of setting up a trust and whether this trust is valid are issues to be resolved under the applicable law, once identified. We address those issues at [215] to [226] below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The governing law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 In <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo Garuda Nusa Pte Ltd v SKP Pradiksi (North) Sdn Bhd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 814 (“<span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span>”) at [41], the Court of Appeal held that the proper law of an express trust is the law chosen by the trustee or, in the absence of such choice, the system of law to which the trust has the closest connection. Since the Court of Appeal also held that the general rules established for determining the choice of law in relation to contracts are applicable in determining the governing law of the trust (at [41]), we turn to the established approach to determine the governing law of a contract set out in <span class="font-italic">Rappo, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Rappo Tania</span>”) at [80], citing <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”) at [82]. First, the court will examine the contract itself to determine whether it states expressly what the governing law is. In the absence of an express statement, the court considers whether the intention of the parties as to the governing law can be inferred from the circumstances. If that cannot be done, the court then identifies the system of law with which the contract has its closest and most real connection: in essence, this is an objective analysis undertaken from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the parties at the time of the contract. The court may bypass the second stage and move to the third stage where neither party addressed their mind to the question of which law is to govern (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [47]). We therefore assess the governing law of the Trust Agreement between the parties according to the three stages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 At the first stage, we find there was no express choice of law provision as Chantal and Weber did not agree upon or stipulate the governing law. At the second stage, as to whether there was an implied choice of law, the search is for a real and not merely hypothetical common intention of the contracting parties, but as objectively ascertained from the terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span> at [42]). The mere fact that there was no written agreement, but only an oral one, is not a bar to a finding that there was an implied choice of law. Where one party seeks to rely on the parties’ course of dealing for the purpose of determining the governing law of the relationship, the relevant course of dealing is that at the outset of the dealings (<span class="font-italic">Rappo Tania</span> at [80]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span> found that there could be an implied choice of law in an oral agreement, and we find the facts there to be highly relevant to the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span>, the parties reached an oral agreement (although the nature and terms of which were heavily contested), and the parties incorporated a Singapore company on 12 November 2012 as a special purpose vehicle for their transaction (at [19]). The dispute was whether a trust had been created over the shares in that Singapore company. After examining all the relevant facts and circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that there was an implied choice of Singapore law (at [43]). The Court of Appeal made two remarks:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was not uncommon for a company to be incorporated as a special purpose vehicle. In <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span>, the parties did so for the sole purpose of holding shares in another company and not to have any business activity beyond that. This was a common occurrence in the complex commercial environment existing today, frequently because of tax reasons or other perceived advantages for being incorporated in a particular jurisdiction, and the fact that the sole objective of the parties in incorporating the company was for it to hold certain assets would not in itself provide a sufficiently strong basis to assume that the governing law of those assets is also the law applicable to the ownership of shares in the company itself (at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, it would be anomalous to ignore the structure that the parties chose to govern their arrangements by focusing on the governing law of the underlying assets. The parties chose to incorporate a separate entity and made a deliberate decision that Singapore should be the jurisdiction in which the company would be constituted (at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Where a trustee is a corporate vehicle specially incorporated for a particular purpose, it may be inferred that the law of the place of incorporation was intended as the governing law for the trust (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s </span>at para 75.332). Just as in <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span>, where the Court of Appeal considered that the parties’ choice of corporate structure to effect their agreement was a key feature, similarly, in the present case, Chantal initially chose a New Zealand incorporated company, managed by Weir, to buy out the Ethocyn Rights. Thereafter, she lost faith in Weir and decided to use Weber instead. Chantal and Weber deliberately chose a Singapore incorporated company to hold the Ethocyn Rights because they concluded that Singapore had a more favourable tax regime. Weber incorporated Renslade (S) in May 2000 upon the instructions of Chantal to hold the Ethocyn Rights. In the very first email from Weber to Chantal, he refers to the “foundation in S”, which we found to be a reference to the Singapore-incorporated Renslade (S). Chantal herself referred to the drafting of distributorship agreements according to Singapore law. It seems that Chantal and Weber always knew that a Singapore incorporated company would be used; even though these structures were implemented after the agreement had been concluded, this does not undermine what would have been the parties’ intentions at the time of the agreement. As in <span class="font-italic">Trisuryo</span>, the later implementation of the agreed upon plan is evidence of the implied choice. For that reason, we find that there was an implied choice of Singapore law between the parties at the outset of their dealings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 In the event we are wrong, and this is taken up elsewhere, we turn to the third stage and consider the question of the system of law with which the transaction has its closest and most real connection. The aim of this stage is not to divine any “intent” of the parties but to consider, on balance, which law has the closest connection with the agreement in question and the circumstances surrounding the inception of that agreement. It is a pragmatic exercise acknowledging that parties do not always have a governing law in mind when they enter into contracts (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [48]). Nonetheless, as acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>, whilst it is not always the case that the parties’ intention on the governing law can be realistically inferred, the court might find it more productive to move to the third stage, although the same factors as those in the second stage would have to be addressed (at [47]). However, the aim is not to divine any “intent” of the parties but to consider what is the proper weightage to be given to the factors, on the facts and circumstances of the case at hand, to consider, on balance, which law has the closest connection with the contract (see [48] and [49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 The connecting factors pointed to various jurisdictions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The following factors pointed in favour of Singapore law:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Weber was a Swiss citizen but had become a Singapore permanent resident in 2002; we note that Weber claims he was already carrying out business in Singapore in 2000 and administered all his business from Singapore.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Weber’s AEIC at para 26.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  In so saying, we have not overlooked the fact that, like many businessmen whose transactions are in multiple jurisdictions, Weber does not always stay in one place. However, by the same token, the specific selection of a jurisdiction to incorporate companies for a specific transaction can be of significance.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Weber incorporated BCS in Singapore in March 1999.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Weber incorporated Renslade (S) in Singapore in May 2000 at Chantal’s direction. Singapore was chosen specifically for tax reasons.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) The Ethocyn Rights were transferred to Renslade (S) in May 2000 and assigned to BCS in April 2002. BCS entered into the Nu Skin SDA in 2003, and Nu Skin made direct payments to BCS from 2003 onwards. Monies were paid from Singapore to other companies (within the structure) for their expenses, including the manufacture and sale of the Ethocyn Products. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) The distributorship agreements between Renslade (S) and BCS, and BCS and its sub-distributors, were expressly stated to be governed by Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The following factors pointed in favour of California or US law:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Chantal was resident in California at all material times. When she required funds, they were transferred to her Los Angeles bank account. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) As Chantal made the decisions in the management of the Ethocyn Rights from California – or wherever else she happened to be at that time – that was also the seat of decision-making.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) The Ethocyn Rights themselves were United States patents (though some were registered outside the USA). BCS’s sub-distributors, E. Cosmetics LLC and Nova Derm, had their registered offices in California. Nu Skin, the largest customer, was a Utah corporation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Not all of the factors listed above should be given the same weight. For example, whilst the Ethocyn business had strong ties with the US, these are but links with third parties, and we find that they have little bearing on the relationship between Chantal and Weber. Moreover, as we have found, Chantal made a conscious decision to move the Ethocyn Rights offshore. As for the Distribution Agreements, these were, on Baker’s case, essentially sham agreements designed to manage tax exposure that involved Weber contracting with himself. We do not think these factors add much weight in favour of either California law or Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 Similarly, the place of Weber’s residence is only relevant because he is the owner and controlling mind of the Singapore companies who were the legal trustees, and into whose account the monies from the Nu Skin SDA were paid. Article 7 of the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on Their Recognition (“the Hague Convention”) lists the place of residence or business of the trustee as <span class="font-italic">one</span> factor in the second half of the list of criteria for identifying the closest connection. As Chantal was herself resident in California, the parties did not even have the same nationality or domicile. Their place of residence is therefore less relevant for determining the applicable law. Chantal’s own residence may have been the seat of decision-making where the Ethocyn business was concerned, but, given her deliberate choice for opacity over her beneficial interest in the business, we do not think much weight should be assigned to this either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 We turn to consider the use of the Singapore incorporated trust vehicles, Renslade (S) and later BCS, which held the Ethocyn Rights. The location of assets is less significant in cases of movable property (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at para 75.332). The Ethocyn Rights could have been held in companies incorporated anywhere in the world and, in today’s modern context with the international nature of business, this could have been done quite easily; they were transferred from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S). Nevertheless, it is of great relevance in this case that Chantal and Weber chose a Singapore incorporated company deliberately, because of the tax regime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 According to Mr Yeo SC, the court is only permitted to consider factors in place at the inception of the Trust Agreement in November 1999, which were Chantal’s California residency and the business’ links to the United States. The connecting factors to Singapore law and, in particular, the incorporation of Renslade (S), only arose after the parties made the Trust Agreement, and so they should be disregarded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 The transfer of property to the trustee is essential to the creation of an inter vivos trust (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at 110.469). A trust is only properly constituted at the time when the trust assets vest in the trustee. Though the Trust Agreement may have occurred in November 2019, it is undisputed that the trust assets were first held in Renslade (NZ) and only vested in Renslade (S) after it had been incorporated. The trust could only have been constituted<span class="font-italic"> </span>at the time when the Ethocyn Rights were transferred to Renslade (S). We may therefore consider the factors that were in existence at that time. To our mind, the strongest factor in favour of Singapore law is the use of Renslade (S), a vehicle incorporated for the deliberate purpose of holding the trust assets. Singapore was the place of administration of the trust chosen by Chantal as settlor. This factor is identified hierarchically as the first one on the list of criteria of Article 7 of the Hague Convention. It is very relevant that Chantal’s unwavering intention was to have the Ethocyn Rights held by a company outside the United States.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 We therefore find that there is sufficient evidence that supports an implied choice of Singapore law and, if we are wrong, Singapore law also has the strongest connecting factors with the case. The answer to [59(f)] above on the Agreed List of Issues is that Singapore law is the appropriate governing law, and we consider the enforceability of the Trust Agreement under Singapore law. However, for completeness, we will also consider its enforceability under California law below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The validity of the trust</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Under Singapore law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there was an express trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Notwithstanding our use of the shorthand phrase “Trust Agreement” to refer to the oral agreement between Chantal and Weber, we must also be satisfied that the said agreement amounted to a trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 First, we consider whether the oral agreement amounted to an express trust as pleaded by the plaintiff (at [22] and [23] above). The formation of an express trust in Singapore law requires three certainties: (a) certainty of the settlor’s intention, (b) certainty of subject matter, and (c) certainty of object (<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span>”) at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Certainty of intention requires proof that a trust was intended by the settlor. The principle is that in what was said or done by the settlor, there must be clear evidence of an intention to create a trust. It must be certain that the settlor intended to create a trust rather than to impose a mere moral obligation or to make a gift or to do some other act which was not a trust (<span class="font-italic">Compania De Navegacion Palomar, S</span><span class="font-italic">.A. and others v Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala</span> [2017] SGHC 14 at [95], citing Alastair Hudson, <span class="font-italic">Equity and Trusts</span> (Routledge, 7th Ed, 2013)). Intention may be inferred from the settlor’s words or conduct, the surrounding circumstances and the interpretation of any agreements that might have been entered into (<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span>at [50]–[53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 It is undisputed that Chantal never used the label of a “trust” in her communications. While it is unnecessary for the settlor to use the word “trust” before an intention to create a trust can be found, as Mr Yeo SC acknowledged, Chantal was familiar with trust structures and would have understood the implications of the term. Mr Yeo SC submits that the fact that she did not use the word “trust” therefore suggests that she did not intend a trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 From our review of the evidence set out above, we have found that, when the Chantal Companies were facing financial difficulties and entered into Chapter 11 proceedings, Chantal came up with the plan to purchase the Ethocyn Rights through an offshore corporation and to move the assets offshore (see [72] to [79] above). The offshore corporation and associated corporate structures would enable her to keep her beneficial ownership opaque. It allowed Chantal to start anew in an offshore location that would also have a more favourable tax regime. In furtherance of this plan, she instructed Weir to get her a New Zealand corporation to hold the Ethocyn Rights and structure a holding and associated companies for different aspects of the Ethocyn business. That was, in essence, an intention to form a trust because Chantal intended to split the legal and beneficial interest of the asset. Weir was Chantal’s professional agent and trustee who would own and control the offshore corporations and holding companies. The Ethocyn Rights were thus acquired by Renslade (NZ) from the Chantal Companies with the sanction of the US Bankruptcy Court on 19 October 1999. Chantal thus had her first trust arrangement, as she intended, in place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 As we found (see [77] above), sometime in November 1999, Chantal lost confidence in Weir and began exploring other options. She engaged another lawyer, Noel Conway,

</div> and considered other corporate structures. It was at or around this time (her loss of confidence in Weir) that Weber, through his collaboration with Wehinger, offered his services. We see from Chantal’s Handwritten Chronology that she travelled to Hungary in November 1999 to look into laboratory space. She also referred to the purchase of some laboratory equipment from an exile in Switzerland and referred to Wehinger: “Dr Wehinger set w/ him.”

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 Through her relationship with Weber, Chantal then planned to shift the location of the trust assets from New Zealand to Singapore, by changing her “trustee” from Renslade (NZ) to the as-yet-unincorporated Renslade (S). By Weber’s email of 9 March 2000, he was already apprised of Chantal’s plan and had begun work on the “foundation in S”, which we found to be Renslade (S) (see [101] above). We therefore found that sometime in November 1999, an oral agreement was reached between Chantal and Weber that Chantal would transfer the ownership of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) to a Singapore corporation and all income and proceeds from the exploitation of the Ethocyn Rights would be held on trust for Chantal save that Weber was entitled to deduct 5% for his commission or remuneration (see [108] above). Work on that process began immediately <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, changing lawyers, undoing the corporate structure set up by Weir and setting up the new corporate structure with Weber and Wehinger. As noted above (see [75] to [78] and [109] to [112]), the documentary evidence shows Chantal, not Weber, spearheading multiple fronts during this period. In her correspondence around March to April 2000, she referred to Renslade (S) as if it was already in existence. In an email dated 10 May 2000 from Chantal to Weber, she referred to drafting and signing the “asset purchase agreement” of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S) and asked, notably, whether it could be backdated to 24 December 1999.

</div> Renslade (S) was incorporated on 23 May 2000 pursuant to Chantal’s direction and involvement. Weber seems to have delayed this as we see Chantal sending chaser emails and facsimiles to Weber for confirmation as to whether this had been done. The assignment of the Ethocyn Rights is dated 24 May 2000 but the evidence shows it was backdated from sometime in September 2001 (see [113] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 Chantal had already formed the necessary intention for a trust even before the sale of the Ethocyn Rights by the US Bankruptcy Courts. That intention was initially directed at the trust in Renslade (NZ) with Shane Weir, but after the assets had been transferred, she changed her mind. Her intention to create a trust remained but she decided to rely on Weber instead of Weir, based on the oral agreement that they reached sometime in November 1999. From the time the agreement was reached, there were many matters to sort out, many arrangements to be made for the business going forward, and some of the legal paperwork fell behind. The incorporation of Renslade (S) was delayed because of Weber’s delays. We therefore find that the trust in Renslade (S) was properly constituted from 24 May 2000, the date specifically chosen by the parties for the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S). This was the day after the incorporation of Renslade (S), which had been incorporated specifically for holding the Ethocyn Rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 We therefore find that this arrangement was a trust where a company, owned and controlled by Weber, would hold the Ethocyn Rights on trust for Chantal; the income or proceeds generated by the Ethocyn Rights were to be held on trust for Chantal, save that Weber was entitled to 5% of the proceeds as his commission or remuneration. The Trustees were Renslade (S), who were subsequently replaced with BCS, and with Renslade (HK) holding some proceeds on trust after 2007 as well, and Weber also is a trustee by virtue of his ownership and control of these companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 As we have found above (see [72] to [74] and [132] above), Chantal had her reasons for keeping her beneficial ownership of the Ethocyn Rights opaque, and this also included her plan to have reduced exposure to taxes. Consequently, she wanted to avoid setting up a formal trust with all its formalities and rigidity. At the same time, there is no dispute that she intended to split the <span class="font-italic">legal </span>and <span class="font-italic">beneficial </span>title of the assets. That is supported by the evidence, which shows that she retained ownership and decision-making power over the assets even though legal ownership was held in Weber’s companies. We find that there is sufficient evidence of Chantal’s certain intention to create a trust; whether that is an illegal trust will be dealt with below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 As for the two other requisite certainties of subject matter and of beneficiaries, it is relatively uncontroversial in this case that the subject matter would be the Ethocyn Rights and the proceeds and profits they generated. The intended beneficiary at the time of the Trust Agreement would have been Chantal herself and, given her demise, her Estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 We therefore find that the Trust Agreement led to the formation of a valid express trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there was a resulting trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 Alternatively, Baker pleaded that a resulting trust was created over the Ethocyn Rights in favour of Chantal as the sole beneficiary (at [24] above) through Chantal’s provision of the funds to acquire the Ethocyn Rights and in the Royalty Buyout. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 A resulting trust is characterised by an absence of intention to part with the beneficial interest in favour of the person taking title to the property (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span> at 110.546). Resulting trusts are imposed by law and arise in two main ways: (a) the transfer of property from one person to another for no consideration, and (b) the failure of an express trust to exhaust the entire beneficial interest (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [34]). The first category is also known as a “presumed resulting trust”, as there is a presumption that the payor did not intend to make a gift to the payee. The beneficial interest remains with the payor. In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, the leading case on resulting trusts in Singapore, the Court of Appeal highlighted the difference between the presumption of resulting trust and the resulting trust itself (at [35]). The presumption is an inference of fact drawn from the existence of other facts, whereas the resulting trust is the equitable response to those facts, proved or presumed. The facts that give rise to a resulting trust are a transfer of property to another in circumstances in which the provider does not intend to benefit the recipient; the facts that give rise to the <span class="font-italic">presumption </span>of resulting trust are a transfer of property to another for which the recipient does not provide the whole of the consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 Weber claims he provided consideration for the Ethocyn Rights or, more accurately, Mr Yeo SC points to documents that there was consideration, as Weber did not give any evidence. We have already found that Chantal provided the funds for the Ethocyn Rights and the Royalty Buyout (at [79] to [92] and [132] to [134] above), which form the core of the Trust Assets. The Ethocyn Rights were also transferred from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S) for, in effect, no consideration (at [116] to [120] above). Even without relying on what we found to be Chantal’s intention to create an express trust (see [217] to [224] above), the facts would give rise to the presumption of a resulting trust. Though the presumption of a resulting trust may be rebutted by clear evidence of the payor’s intention to make a gift to the recipient (<span class="font-italic">Tay Yok Swee v United Overseas Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd and others</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 36 at [17]), there is no indication that Chantal intended to make a gift to Weber; she met him less than a year before Renslade (S) was incorporated. As set out above, Weber appeared to be an accountant for Chantal, particularly in the early years (at [99] and [105] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 We therefore find that a resulting trust will also arise on the facts, and we address the implications of this below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Under California law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231  For completeness, we also consider the parties’ cases on the formation of a trust under California law. The parties agreed for California law to be proved by way of submissions rather than expert evidence (see [64] above). Baker was represented by Ms Rachel J. Harris and Mr Jeffrey A. Krieger, and the Defendants were represented by Ms Manya Devanatan and Mr Howard M. Ehrenberg.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 California trust law largely mirrors Singapore law. The existence of an oral trust is established when there is clear and convincing evidence that: (i) the settlor intended to create a trust; (ii) there is trust property; (iii) the purpose of the trust is valid; and (iv) there is an identified beneficiary: see Cal. Prob. Code. §§ 15201–15203, 15205, 15207.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 The “clear and convincing” standard may be satisfied in several ways (<span class="font-italic">Fahrney v. Wilson</span>, 4 Cal. Rptr. 670, 673 (Cal. Ct. App. 1960)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is often said that the evidence to prove an oral trust of personalty must be clear and convincing, and especially so in cases where the alleged declarant is dead at the time of suit.  However, the application of this test is primarily for the trial court, whose determination cannot be attacked on appeal if there is substantial evidence to support the judgment.  The required proof may be indirect, consisting of acts, conduct and circumstances.... </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 The trial court may consider self-serving declarations of a decedent, made before or after the alleged trust was created, and it may draw inferences supported by substantial evidence: see <span class="font-italic">Hansen v. Bear Film Co</span>., 28 Cal. 2d 154, 173–175 (Cal. Sup. Ct., 1946).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 Two of the four oral trust requirements cannot be seriously contested. The trust property is the Ethocyn Rights and related assets; and Chantal was the beneficiary. The real issues are whether Chantal intended to create a trust and whether the trust is invalid under Cal. Prob. Code § 15203 because it was "created for [a] purpose that is…illegal or against public policy".</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Chantal intended to create a trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 The evidence discussed in the analysis of Singapore law leads to the same conclusion under California law – Chantal intended to create a trust. She devoted most of her adult life to the creation and exploitation of Ethocyn. She invented the compound (with one other person) in the early 1980s; obtained patents for its use in skin care products; and licensed the Ethocyn Rights to companies she controlled. In 1999, when the Chantal Companies were in bankruptcy, Chantal provided the funds for Renslade (NZ) to acquire the Ethocyn Rights from the Bankruptcy Court. A few years later, she settled the class action securities fraud lawsuit with her own funds. Thereafter, at her direction, the Ethocyn Rights were transferred several times, until they came to be held by BCS Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 From 2002, until her death in 2016, Chantal ran the Ethocyn business successfully. She arranged for and supervised the manufacture of Ethocyn, and she negotiated licensing agreements with distributors. She relied on Weber to structure the business entities, manage accounts, and reap the profits. He received a 5% commission for those services.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 There is no contemporaneous reference to the creation of an oral trust in any of the many emails, notes or other documents in evidence. Even in later communications, there is no written evidence from Chantal stating that Weber was holding her assets in trust. But the parties’ conduct over more than 15 years clearly evidences a trust relationship. Chantal ran the business as her own and Weber took her directions without question. She regularly instructed that funds be transferred to her accounts, often asking that the transfer be made within 24 hours. At one point, the parties discussed how to book those transfers and they decided to call them operating expenses.

Weber then wrote the 4 June 2016 letter that totally contradicts his claimed ownership of the Trust Assets, and provides compelling evidence of the existence of an oral trust (see [165] above). In that letter, Weber “confirmed” that all the BCS Singapore assets “will go to you or to your daughters”; that he will transfer all assets to a new structure agreed upon by Chantal’s attorneys; that “[t]rust is [his] business”; and that, since Chantal no longer trusts him, he will not continue working with her.

We are unable to accept this submission as it draws an unnecessary fine line when the clear purpose of such a declaration would be to assure the Bankruptcy Court and the creditors that Chantal did not have any interest in Renslade (NZ). We found above that the Estate has made out its case that Chantal was responsible for deciding upon a New Zealand corporation, Renslade (NZ), to purchase the Ethocyn Rights. We also found that it was Chantal who funded the purchase of the Ethocyn Rights.

The Court of Appeal set out a two-stage test to ascertain whether or not an agreement may be unenforceable due to illegality (at [64] and [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 The <span class="font-italic">first stage</span> of the inquiry is to ascertain whether the contract, as opposed to merely the conduct, is prohibited either pursuant to a statute or an established head of common law public policy (at [22] and [64]). If the contract is prohibited by statute, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, an unlicensed moneylending contract falling afoul of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed), then there can be no recovery whatsoever pursuant to the illegal contract; the contract is void and unenforceable. If the contract falls foul of established heads of common law public policy, then that would also render a contract unenforceable. Examples of this include contracts prejudicial to the administration of justice (including contracts to stifle a prosecution and contracts savouring of maintenance or champerty); contracts to deceive public authorities; contracts to oust the jurisdiction of the courts; contracts to commit a crime, tort or fraud; contracts prejudicial to public safety; contracts prejudicial to the status of marriage (including marriage brokerage contracts as well as agreements by married persons to marry and agreements between spouses for future separation); contracts promoting sexual immorality; contracts that are liable to corrupt public life; and contracts restricting personal liberty (at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 Under the second category of common law illegality, there are a category of contracts which are not unlawful <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but which are tainted by illegality in that they nevertheless involve the commission of a legal wrong in their formation, purpose or manner of performance. The traditional approach was that the court would not enforce these agreements as they were tainted with illegality. In <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May v Boon Lay Choo </span>[2014] 3 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading</span>, the Court of Appeal departed from the traditional approach and held that the enforcement of this category of contracts is subject to the limiting principle of <span class="font-italic">proportionality</span> (at [39] and [64]). To determine whether these contracts are enforceable under the principle of proportionality, the court has to undertake a fact-centric enquiry and consider different factors, including:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether allowing the claim would undermine the purpose of the prohibiting rule;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the nature and gravity of the illegality;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the remoteness or centrality of the illegality to the contract;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the object, intent, and conduct of the parties; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the consequences of denying the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 In the case of such contracts, the court will consider the proportionality of refusing to enforce the contract in deciding whether or not it is prohibited under the first stage. If the contract is not prohibited, the court may enforce it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 If the contract is prohibited, the court then moves on to the <span class="font-italic">second stage</span> of the inquiry, which is to ascertain whether, notwithstanding the fact that there can be no recovery pursuant to the (illegal) contract, there might, nevertheless, be restitutionary recovery of the benefits conferred thereunder (as opposed to recovery of full contractual damages) (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>at [42] and [65]). There are three possible avenues for restitutionary recovery:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where the parties are not <span class="font-italic">in pari delicto</span>, or equally at fault, the plaintiff may seek restitutionary recovery (at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where the plaintiff is permitted a <span class="font-italic">locus poenitentiae </span>or opportunity for repentance, the plaintiff may obtain restitutionary recovery of benefits he has transferred pursuant to an illegal contract (at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the plaintiff has an <span class="font-italic">independent cause of action</span> such that he or she does not have to rely on the illegal contract in a substantive legal matter, the parties may be returned to a position they would have been in if they had never entered into the illegal transaction at all (at [50]). Traditionally, this involved claims in tort and the law of trusts premised on the plaintiff’s property or title (at [51]). The Court of Appeal also held that restitutionary recovery may be available on a claim in unjust enrichment, subject to the defence of illegality and public policy (at [139]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 The Court of Appeal addressed the possibility of an independent cause of action in unjust enrichment in detail. The ordinary requirements for a claim in unjust enrichment are necessary, one of which is the existence of an unjust factor (at [140]). The claim is also subject to the usual defences to unjust enrichment of illegality and public policy – the issue of illegality therefore arises again not in the contractual sense, but as a defence (at [143]). The guiding principle is <span class="font-italic">stultification, </span>and a claim in unjust enrichment will be precluded where allowing it will undermine the fundamental policy that rendered the underlying contract void and unenforceable in the first place (at [145]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 The Court of Appeal also considered the application of the principle of stultification to the other independent causes of action, such as the traditional claims in tort and trusts (at [161]). It was of the view that independent causes of action may be similarly disallowed if allowing them would <span class="font-italic">stultify </span>or undermine the fundamental policy that rendered the agreement illegal in the first place (at [168]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 We now apply these principles to the case before us.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Trust Agreement is illegal or tainted by illegality</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 The Trust Agreement is not prohibited under any Singapore statute. Nor is it prohibited under any established heads of common law public policy. We therefore turn to whether the Trust Agreement is tainted by illegality. A Singapore court will not enforce a contract “if its object or purpose would involve doing an act in a foreign and friendly state which would violate the law of that state” (<span class="font-italic">BCBC Singapore Pte Ltd and another v PT Bayan Resources TBK</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1 at [175]). According to the Defendants, the object and purpose of the Trust Agreement was to deceive the creditors and the Bankruptcy Court by keeping Chantal’s assets out of their reach. The Defendants also argue that the performance of the Trust Agreement was unlawful because Chantal had made false declarations and continued to conceal her beneficial interest in the Ethocyn Rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 We find that the object of the Trust Agreement was not unlawful. It is not unlawful for A to arrange for B to hold intellectual property and attendant rights on trust for A with B being remunerated from the proceeds generated from those rights. The Defendants’ argument that the object of the Trust Agreement was to keep the Trust Assets out of the creditors’ reach is misconceived. We have already found above there were no other buyers interested in the Ethocyn Rights despite the efforts of the Creditors’ Committee (see [94] above); we are not surprised, given their nature, the specialist effort required to be able to exploit them and the need to put in more capital to do so. If Chantal had not made the false statements, it would, in all probability, only result in the creditors attempting to obtain a better price for the Ethocyn Rights. Whether Chantal would have agreed to pay more, or whether the Creditors’ Committee would have thrown in the towel at some point, especially given the expiry of the patents in 2004, the lack of interest from potential bidders and the need to sink in more capital, will be pure speculation. Chantal’s declarations to the Bankruptcy Court were made in September 1999 but the Trust Agreement was made sometime in November 1999. These declarations predate the Trust Agreement, and so they cannot be said to have formed the object and purpose of the Agreement. The Defendants certainly do not plead or imply they knew of Chantal’s plans from early 1999 to September and October 1999. On the contrary, the Defendants distance themselves from this by pleading the purchase of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) in or around May 2000 or later. The Defendants then argue that the object and purpose of the Trust Agreement was to deceive the creditors and the Bankruptcy Court but, by the time of the Trust Agreement, the deception had already occurred. It is also misguided to refer to the “performance” of the Trust Agreement as unlawful because, by the time the Trust Agreement had been reached, the unlawful acts had already been performed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 There was some suggestion that the purpose of the Trust Agreement was to evade taxes, with the defendants highlighting the consequences of evasion of US taxes.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, this was not pleaded, possibly because Weber himself would be implicated in any such scheme. We therefore do not consider this part of the object and purpose of the Trust Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 However, we find that the Trust Agreement may not have been unlawful <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but it was tainted by illegality. Chantal’s false declarations to the Bankruptcy Court were undoubtedly part of the basis upon which the US Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the Ethocyn Rights to Renslade (NZ). At the time of Chantal’s communications with Weir and the purchase of the Ethocyn Rights by Renslade (NZ), she clearly intended to hide her interest in the Ethocyn Rights. The corpus of the Trust was obtained partly through making false declarations (see [242] above). The Estate cannot “wash” that illegality through the later Trust Agreement and incorporation of Renslade (S).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 The Trust Agreement therefore falls under the category of contracts discussed in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>([250] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) to which the principle of proportionality will be applied (at [39]). The courts examine the relevant policy considerations underlying the illegality principle so as to produce a proportionate response to the illegality in each case (<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May </span>([252] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [66]). This is a fact-centric analysis, and the proportionality of enforcing the Trust Agreement must be considered in light of the factors set out at [252] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 Upon consideration of the proportionality factors, we find that they point to the disproportionality of refusing to enforce the Trust Agreement. Without downplaying the severity of Chantal’s conduct in the Bankruptcy Proceedings, we do not think that the nature and gravity of the false declarations is so severe as to weigh against enforcement of the Trust Agreement. There is no prohibition against a debtor in bankruptcy proceedings buying back its own assets; the only difference is that the courts will apply a higher level of scrutiny to ensure that the sale is fair. The question is whether the bankruptcy sales were fair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 We detailed the conduct of the Bankruptcy Proceedings above (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, [10] above). Crucially, we note that there was an active Creditors’ Committee, and they hired the Kriegsman Group as an investment banker and other consultants to market the products to 20 potential buyers. In spite of the best efforts of the Creditors’ Committee, no other offers were made for the Ethocyn Rights. Renslade (NZ) remained the best offer. In fact, as we highlighted at [94], Renslade (NZ) had actually made a higher offer for the Ethocyn Rights first <span class="font-italic">and had been rejected</span>. That, to us, is clear evidence that Chantal was not manipulating the Bankruptcy Proceedings for her own benefit. Even when the APA between the Creditors’ Committee and Renslade (NZ) was presented to the court, there was an option for other potential buyers or “overbidders” to purchase these assets at the hearing, and yet there were no overbids (at [11] above). Though that might seem suspicious, it is easily explained by the unique nature of the Ethocyn Rights, as highlighted at [93]. There was no ready market for the Ethocyn Rights as they consisted of intellectual property, and not any buyer would have been able to exploit them. Chantal, as the inventor, was possibly one of the few people in the world uniquely able to use these assets. Aside from a vague claim that full disclosure would have led to “stricter scrutiny” of the sale, the Defendants have not shown how the disclosure of Chantal’s interest in Renslade (NZ) would have materially affected the bankruptcy sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Another factor in the proportionality analysis is the remoteness of the illegality; this means that some real or central connection must be demonstrated by the party relying on the defence of illegality between the contract concerned and the unlawful intention (<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span> ([252] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [67]). We find that the false declarations are remote from the Trust Agreement. A key indication as to whether the illegality is too remote from the contract lies in whether any overt step in carrying out the unlawful intention was taken in the contract itself (<span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May </span>at [67]). The declarations were made in September 1999, before the Trust Agreement had been reached and Weber was not yet in the picture. There could not have been any “overt step” in carrying out the unlawful intention as said unlawful act had been carried out by the time of the Trust Agreement. As stated above, at its highest, the corpus of the Trust is tainted by illegality as it was obtained on the basis of false declarations set out at [242]. As noted, those false declarations were not the only bases upon which the US Bankruptcy Court approved the sale. Further, this approval was some 20 years prior to these proceedings. From 2002 to 2015, parties abided by the Trust Agreement in managing the Trust Assets. We do not think the false declarations had a strong or central connection to the Trust Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 We add that the US Bankruptcy Court approved the APA on 19 October 1999 (see [11] above), the class action suit against Chantal and Chantal Pharmaceutical was settled in May 2001 (see [14] above) and the Bankruptcy Court approved the Royalty Buyout in 2002 (see [16] above). Since then, it appears that no action has been taken in those proceedings and the Bankruptcy Court orders still stand. Nothing has been done that would impugn those orders and, even if something can be done, it is not clear which party would have standing to do so. This court is not the proper forum to nullify the order. That weighs in our consideration of the remoteness of the alleged illegality. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 As for the conduct of the parties, Chantal deliberately hid her interests from the Bankruptcy Court, and her alleged motive of facing death threats, on the facts and circumstances of this case, should not, as stated above, be given disproportionate significance. We have also found that Chantal was in all likelihood also motivated by a desire to exploit own product (see [74] above). At the same time, we think Weber’s conduct in the performance of the Trust Agreement is also relevant. Under the Trust Agreement, he was to manage the assets on behalf of Chantal and yet now he stands to benefit from all her work over the past two decades. We also find that the consequences of denying the Estate’s claim weigh in favour of enforcing the Trust Agreement, because Weber will stand to benefit. Weber is a trustee, acting in flagrant breach of his duties as such and attempting to misappropriate trust properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 Finally, we address the issue of whether allowing the claim will undermine the purpose of the prohibiting rule. This relates to the principle established in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>([250] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) of stultification, which applies at the second stage of the inquiry<span class="font-italic"> </span>(we address that principle below at [274]). In the present case, the rule that was violated is that a party in bankruptcy proceedings should not make false declarations to the court, and it exists because the court must have all material information available so that it can protect the creditors’ interest. Undoubtedly, Chantal’s false declarations would have fallen afoul of this rule. At the same time, the Defendants have not shown how the falsity of these declarations made a difference in the conduct of the Bankruptcy Proceedings. If Chantal is able to lay claim to the Trust Assets, we do not think it would undermine or make a mockery of the Bankruptcy Proceedings. That might be the case if she had purchased the assets at an undervalue, but there is no evidence of that. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 Applying the principle of proportionality, we find that there is no reason not to enforce the Trust Agreement, and it is not prohibited under the first stage of the inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether there is an independent cause of action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 Even if we are wrong, and the Trust Agreement is prohibited under a common law head of public policy, we find that the Estate still has an independent cause of action under Singapore law under a resulting trust, as we found at [227] to [230] above that a resulting trust is presumed to arise on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 The resulting trust is one of the traditional independent causes of action that have been recognised as allowing the recovery of benefits conferred under an illegal transaction (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>([250] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [51]). The leading case on this is the decision of the UK House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Tinsley v Milligan </span>[1994] 1 AC 340 (“<span class="font-italic">Tinsley</span>”), which was discussed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>(at [54] to [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 In <span class="font-italic">Tinsley</span>, the parties purchased a house in which they cohabited as a couple. The house was conveyed into the name of the plaintiff, but both parties had provided money for the purchase. The aim was to allow the defendant to claim social security benefits from the state, which would only be distributed if she did not own a home. The parties fell out and the plaintiff moved out. The plaintiff then brought an action for possession to claim that the house was hers, while the defendant brought a counterclaim for an order of sale and a declaration that the plaintiff held the property on trust for both parties in equal shares. The majority of the House of Lords found in favour of the defendant, holding that illegality did not bar the defendant’s claim because the presumption of resulting trust allowed the defendant to establish an equitable interest in the property. The defendant did not have to rely on the underlying illegal agreement to establish a proprietary interest in the house.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 <span class="font-italic">Tinsley</span> has been subject to criticism because of its perceived arbitrariness. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>([250] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) noted at [163], it is “subject to the accidents of pleading”; after all, had the parties in <span class="font-italic">Tinsley</span> been married, the presumption of advancement could have applied to bar the defendant’s claim and he would then be unable to rely on the illegal agreement to rebut that presumption. In <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading</span>, the Court of Appeal considered the possibility of departing from <span class="font-italic">Tinsley, </span>but left the question open for a future case (at [166] to [168]). However, the Court of Appeal’s criticism of <span class="font-italic">Tinsley </span>was in the context of its discussion of the case of <span class="font-italic">Nelson v Nelson </span>(1995) 184 CLR 538, a decision of the High Court of Australia where the plaintiff had to rely on the illegal agreement to rebut the presumption of advancement (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>at [165]). The facts of that decision do not arise in the present case. Instead, the present case involves a classic example of the plaintiff’s entitlement to property based on the independent cause of action of the presumption of resulting trust. No “reliance” on the illegal agreement, in the formal or procedural sense or in the normative or substantive sense (Ochroid Trading at [128] to [130]), is necessary, because any “reliance” by Weber on the Trust Agreement would affirm, rather than rebut, the trust, by establishing Chantal’s clear intention to retain an interest in the Ethocyn Rights. The case falls squarely within the <span class="font-italic">Tinsley </span>category of cases and, as it has not been overruled, the Estate can rely on the resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 In <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([250] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal also considered whether the principle of <span class="font-italic">stultification </span>applies to independent property claims in the law of trusts (at [168]). Though it did not reach a conclusive view on the issue, we nonetheless consider whether the principle of stultification would operate such that we should disallow the claim in resulting trust. The principle of stultification precludes allowing a claim if to do so would undermine the fundamental policy that rendered the underlying contract void and unenforceable in the first place (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>at [145]). We have set out our reasons for finding that allowing the claim would not undermine the fundamental policy that rendered the Trust Agreement illegal in our analysis on proportionality above (see [263] to [269] above), and we would reach the same conclusion here. Specifically, in the context of a claim for restitutionary remedies, we find that allowing the Estate to claim title to the Trust Assets on the basis of a resulting trust does not undermine the policy in prohibiting false declarations in bankruptcy proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 We therefore find that the Estate would have an independent cause of action against the Defendants in a resulting trust, as Chantal provided the funds involved in the purchase of the Ethocyn Rights and the Royalty Buyout, and the Ethocyn Rights were transferred to Renslade (S) for no consideration. However, we highlight that, under this independent cause of action, the parties may only be returned to the position they would have been in had they never entered into the illegal transaction (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>([250] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [50] and [129]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 In conclusion, we find that the Trust Agreement is not unenforceable by reason of illegality under the governing law of the trust, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore law. To answer [59(i)] and [59(j)] of the Agreed List of Issues above, the Trust Agreement is not illegal, void or unenforceable as being contrary to public policy, and even if it was, the Defendants nevertheless hold the Trust Assets and Trust Monies on a resulting trust for the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Illegality under California law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 For completeness, we also address the parties’ arguments on whether the Trust would be invalid by reason of illegality or as against public policy under California law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Trust is enforceable assuming it was created for an invalid purpose </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 Under California law, a trust may be created for any purpose that is not illegal or against public policy: see Cal. Prob. Code § 15203. The purpose of the trust was to allow Chantal to continue to conduct her business without revealing that she was the beneficial owner of the Trust Assets.  As a general matter, a trust established to maintain confidentiality is perfectly valid under California law: see Cal. Prob. Code § 15203.  The death threats may have been the motive behind Chantal’s desire for confidentiality, but they do not justify her actions and we have already found that the statements to the Bankruptcy Court were false. The Creditors' Committee accepted Renslade (NZ)’s proposal and the Bankruptcy Court approved the sale on the belief that Chantal had no relationship to Renslade (NZ). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 A trust created for the purpose of defrauding creditors is illegal under California law: see <span class="font-italic">Goodrich v. Briones</span><span class="font-italic"> (In re Schwarzkopf)</span>, 626 F.3d. 1032, 1037 (9th Cir. 2010). But, the analysis does not end there. Even if the express trust is set up for an illegal purpose, the court may impose a resulting trust to do justice to the case. The Defendants contend that Chantal’s false declarations to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court were criminal acts under 18 U.S.C. §§ 152 and 157.  They acknowledge that Chantal was never prosecuted; and that private parties have no standing to pursue a claim based on those statutes.  But they argue that “the court is entitled to take cognisance of [Chantal’s] criminal conduct”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 530.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> (D’s Closing Submissions at 530).  We agree that Chantal’s conduct is one aspect of the analysis of the enforceability of an illegal trust. Calling it criminal conduct does not change the analysis. As set out in <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Torrez</span>, 827 F.2d 1299 (“<span class="font-italic">In re Torrez</span>”), 1301 (9th Cir. 1987), California courts look to four factors in deciding whether to enforce an illegal trust:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he completed nature of the transaction, such that the public can no longer be protected by invocation of the rule that illegal agreements are not to be enforced; the absence of serious moral turpitude…; the likelihood that… the party asserting the illegality [will] be unjustly enriched at the expense of the other party; and disproportionality of forfeiture as weighed against the nature of the illegality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 The facts of <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Torrez </span>were uncontroversial. A couple purchased 120 acres of land but registered the title of the land in the names of their son and daughter-in-law. The purpose of this arrangement was to exceed the son and daughter-in-law’s maximum allotment of federally subsidised irrigation water. When the son and daughter-in-law were in a precarious financial position, the parents directed that the property be conveyed to their daughter as trustee, and this was done so for no consideration. The son and daughter-in-law subsequently became bankrupt, and had to sell the property. They sought an order to reconvey the property to them, while the parents opposed it on the grounds that an express oral trust existed or, alternatively, that the land was held in a resulting trust in their favour. The son and daughter-in-law argued that any trust would be void because the purpose of the trust was illegal, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to avoid federal law governing allotment of irrigation water.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 The 9th Circuit applied all four factors to determine whether the defence of illegality applied. It found that the contract had been completed, and was not executory, and so an invocation of the rule against illegality would benefit the public only by way of example. The conduct of the parents did not involve serious moral turpitude; the only penalty for their conduct would have been the loss of eligibility for irrigation water. What the 9th Circuit found “most compelling” was the likelihood that the children would be enriched at the expense of their parents; they would benefit from the sale of property upon which they had never paid a cent, nor worked, nor otherwise expended any effort, and this would amount to unjust enrichment. As for disproportionality, the land would be forfeited when the original penalty was mere disentitlement to federally subsidised water. The 9th Circuit therefore concluded that the factors weighed in favour of imposing a resulting trust, and the son and daughter-in-law were precluded from relying on illegality as a defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 Similarly, applying <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Torrez </span>to the present case, all four factors favour enforcement of the Trust. The bankruptcy proceedings were concluded 20 years ago. Chantal's conduct did not involve serious moral turpitude.  She did not use the trust to hide assets, and she did not attempt to purchase the Trust Assets until after the Creditors' Committee, with professional assistance, was unable to find another buyer. Though she may have hoped to purchase the Trust Assets at a low price, there is no real evidence that, had she disclosed her interest in Renslade (NZ), the price would have been higher – there was no other buyer of the Ethocyn Rights. If Weber were allowed to keep the Trust Assets, he would be unjustly enriched, perhaps by as much as $41 million, and that result would be greatly disproportionate to the mere fact of Chantal’s false declarations in the bankruptcy proceedings. We therefore find that, even if Chantal’s purpose of creating the trust was illegal, under California law, Baker would prevail on his claim that the Trust is an enforceable resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Trust violates public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 The Defendants maintain that, because Chantal's false statements to the Bankruptcy Court constituted a fraud on the court, public policy prohibits enforcement of the Trust. They rely on <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Roussos </span>541 B.R. 721 (“<span class="font-italic">In re Roussos</span>”) (Bankr. C. D. Cal. 2015)<span class="font-italic">, </span>where the Bankruptcy Court denied a motion to dismiss a claim to set aside a sale order, holding that, "[t]he fraud alleged here was so serious as to prevent the judicial machinery from performing “in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases….”" (<span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Roussos </span>at 725). The fraud allegations in <span class="font-italic">In re Roussos</span>, however, were far more serious than the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 In the early 1980s, August Michaelides (“August”) and two Roussos brothers agreed to buy two apartment buildings, with August owning one third of one property and ten percent of the other property. Ten years later, after August died, his wife, Lula Michaelides (“Michaelides”), learned that the Roussos brothers had failed to include August on the deeds to the properties. She sued to quiet title and obtained a judgment quieting title and awarding her $1.1 million in damages and fees.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 The Roussos brothers then conspired to extinguish Michaelides' interest in the properties. They set up two corporations, filed individual chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions, and then filed a motion to sell the properties to their corporations. The Roussos brothers falsely declared that they had no interest in the corporations; that the sale was at arms-length; and that the properties were over-encumbered. The end result was that Michaelides lost her interest in the properties and the Roussos brothers and their corporations obtained bankruptcy protection as discharged debtors and good faith purchasers. The Bankruptcy Court noted that fraud on the court is a fraud that "defiles the court itself” (<span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Roussos </span>at 729). The facts of <span class="font-italic">In re Roussos </span>fit that definition because the Roussos brothers basically used the court as an unwitting participant in a scheme to defraud Michaelides. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 Chantal's misrepresentations, although worthy of condemnation, did not rise to the level of a fraud on the court. There was an active Creditors' Committee that hired independent professionals to seek buyers, without success. There is no evidence that Chantal hid any assets or otherwise interfered with the bankruptcy proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 The facts here are more like those in <span class="font-italic">Matter of Met-L-Wood Corp </span>(861 F.2d 1012 (7th Cir. 1988) (“<span class="font-italic">Matter of Met-L-Wood Corp</span>”), where the successful bidder at a foreclosure sale was a shill for the debtor. Met-L-Wood was indirectly owned by one Frederick Pipin. When it entered financial trouble, it conducted a public foreclosure sale. The sale was advertised in major newspapers, and letters were sent to 40 creditors announcing the date, time, and place. Bids were solicited and received, and there were only two bids – one by Thomas Smith and one by Gerald Thompson. The creditors preferred Thompson’s bid, and the sale was approved. Six months later, a trustee was appointed who concluded that both Smith and Thompson were shills for Pipin; it emerged that, after the sale, Thompson had sold the only profitable part of the business back to Pipin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 The court noted that all of the unsecured creditors had been notified of the sale, and there was an active committee of creditors that had participated actively through counsel in the hearings before the bankruptcy court. There was no indication that the assets were worth more than what was bid, nor that the defendants had done anything to impede or discourage the bidding at the sale. As the creditors who appeared had actively urged the judge to approve the bid, the court found that a fair inference could be drawn that the bid was in the best interest of all creditors. If the debtor used his control to obtain the bankruptcy assets "for a song", it would be a fraud on the creditors, but not a fraud on the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 Given the similarities between <span class="font-italic">Matter of Met-L-Wood Corp</span> and the present case, we conclude that the Trust Agreement did not involve illegality or fraud on the court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the court would impose a constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 We have set out why a court applying California law would find an express trust or, at the very least, a resulting trust. The Estate also submitted that the court should impose a statutory constructive trust over the assets arising out of the Weber’s wrongful act in order to prevent unjust enrichment, as Weber had promised to hold the assets on an express trust but failed to do so.

</div> They did not pursue this argument with great vigour, and we do not think we need to say any more about this given our finding that the Trust is valid and enforceable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Trust is an irrevocable self-settled trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 The parties also ran arguments on whether or not the Trust was an irrevocable self-settled trust. Although this was somewhat a peripheral issue, we address it for completeness as, if the Defendants’ arguments are true, it may undermine our findings on the enforceability of the Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">292 An irrevocable self-settled trust is one that cannot be revoked by the settlor during his lifetime, and where the same individual is both settlor and beneficiary. Such a trust is prohibited under California law by reason of public policy because it places the property of the settlor beyond the reach of their creditors.

</div> The Defendants submit that the Trust was such an invalid irrevocable self-settled trust as Chantal was both the settlor and the beneficiary, and given that she intended to keep her assets out of the reach of her creditors, she must have intended an irrevocable trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 On the other hand, Baker denies that the Trust was an invalid irrevocable self-settled trust, as emails exchanged between Chantal and Weber – where Chantal sought an accounting of the Trust Assets – clearly demonstrate that Chantal obviously intended that the assets would be returned to her. Baker also relies on Cal. Prob. Code § 15400, which states that a trust is revocable unless by its terms it is expressly made irrevocable. Even if it was an irrevocable trust, pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code § 15304, the court would merely invalidate the provision that renders the trust irrevocable and not the entire trust.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 Cal. Prob. Code § 15400 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unless a trust is expressly made irrevocable by the trust instrument, the trust is revocable by the settlor. This section applies only where the settlor is domiciled in this state when the trust is created, where the trust instrument is executed in this state, or where the trust instrument provides that the law of this state governs the trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 It is undisputed that Chantal was domiciled in California at the time the Trust was created, and the Trust must have been a revocable one. We do not think the Defendants are correct to suggest that, because Chantal intended to keep the assets out of the reach of her creditors <span class="font-italic">at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings</span>, she must have intended an irrevocable trust which would keep the assets out of her own hands <span class="font-italic">for her lifetime</span>. This supports the evidence, set out above, that Chantal treated the Trust Assets as her own and clearly expected them to be returned to her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">296 Our conclusion is fortified by Cal. Prob. Code § 15304, which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the settlor is a beneficiary of a trust created by the settlor and the settlor’s interest is subject to a provision restraining the voluntary or involuntary transfer of the settlor’s interest, the restraint is invalid against transferees or creditors of the settlor. The invalidity of the restraint on transfer does not affect the validity of the trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 Admittedly, the present case involved an oral trust and not a trust instrument for an express trust. What Cal. Prob. Code § 15304 reflects is that the invalidity of the restraint on transfer does not lead to the invalidity of the entire trust. Instead, the courts will just treat it as a revocable trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">298 In conclusion, under California law, the Trust created here will be recognised as a valid trust. To answer [59(g)] and [59(h)] of the Agreed List of Issues above, the Trust is valid under California law and, if it were not so, there would still be a valid resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusions and Judgment/Remedies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">299 Having found the Trust Agreement to be valid and enforceable, we find that the Defendants have breached their fiduciary duty to Chantal by failing to provide an account of the Trust and the Trust Monies. In addition, the Defendants have breached the Trust Agreement by unilaterally increasing the commission from 5% to 10% from 2016 to 2017 without Chantal’s knowledge and consent. We also find that Weber breached his fiduciary duty to Chantal by failing to procure BCS or Renslade (HK) to return the Trust Assets, and breached his contractual obligation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Chantal to return the CHF9.5 million borrowed from the Trust with 3% annual interest. The Defendants, having claimed both legal and beneficial ownership over the Trust Assets and Trust Monies, conspired with the intention of injuring Chantal and/or the Estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 Consequently, taking into account the remedies sought by the plaintiff at [33] above, we make the following orders.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) We declare that BCS and/or Renslade (HK) hold the Trust Assets and/or Trust Monies and/or any other income or proceeds generated from the Trust Assets on trust for the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) We order the Defendants to provide a detailed account of all transactions taken place in respect of the Trust Assets and/or Trust Monies within 14 days from the date of this judgment.

<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">SIC/S 3/2018</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Michael A. Baker (Executor of the Estate of Chantal Burnison, Deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> [2020] SGHC(I) 10</span></p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court (delivered by Justice Quentin Loh, Justice Carolyn Berger and Justice Dominique Hascher):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>SICC declares that the defendants hold the rights to the patents of Ethocyn (“the Ethocyn Rights”) and the income and proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights on trust for the Estate. </span></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p><span>1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The plaintiff is the executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison (“Chantal”), who was based in Los Angeles and passed away on 2 October 2016 in Los Angeles. Chantal was the co-inventor of a compound called “Ethocyn”, a skin product said to make the skin look younger and better toned.</p>
<p><span>2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The rights to the inventions and patents of Ethocyn (“the Ethocyn Rights”) were assigned to California-incorporated companies that were controlled by Chantal sometime prior to May 1982 (“the Chantal Companies”). In February 1999, the Chantal Companies entered into bankruptcy proceedings in the United States (“the Bankruptcy Proceedings”). The companies’ assets, including the Ethocyn Rights, were acquired by a New Zealand corporation, Renslade Holdings Limited (“Renslade (NZ)”) with the approval of the US Bankruptcy Court in October 1999.</p>
<p><span>3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Subsequently, the Ethocyn Rights were transferred from Renslade NZ to Renslade Singapore Pte Ltd (“Renslade (S)”) and then, in 2002, to the first defendant, BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd (“BCS”). Renslade (S) and BCS are Singapore incorporated companies. The third defendant is a Hong Kong incorporated company, Renslade Holdings Limited (“Renslade (HK)”). The second defendant, Marcus Weber (“Weber”), is a Swiss national and a Singapore permanent resident. Weber controlled Renslade (S), BCS and Renslade (HK) and therefore indirectly the legal owner of the Ethocyn Rights. Renslade (HK), BCS and Weber are collectively referred to as “the Defendants”.</p>
<p><span>4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In June 2003, the Defendants entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Nu Skin International Inc (“Nu Skin”) whereby BCS agreed to supply Ethocyn to Nu Skin for its use and distribution. The payments made by Nu Skin to BCS formed the bulk of the proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights (referred to as the “Trust Monies”). In or around 2007, the bulk of the Trust Monies were transferred from BCS to Renslade (HK). In or around 2014, Weber withdrew a sum of CHF9.5 million from the Trust Monies. </p>
<p><strong>The dispute</strong></p>
<p><span>5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>According to the plaintiff, Chantal was the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights. Chantal instructed a lawyer to use Renslade (NZ) to purchase the Ethocyn Rights on her behalf from the Chantal Companies during the Bankruptcy Proceedings. In or around November 1999, Chantal wished to relocate her place of business to Singapore. She entered into an agreement with Weber (“the Trust Agreement”), for Weber to acquire the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) and hold any income or proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights on trust for her (“the Trust Assets”). Under the Trust Agreement, the Defendants are entitled to retain 5% of the proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights.</p>
<p><span>6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In support of the plaintiff’s case, he alleged that Chantal provided the funds for the purchase of the Ethocyn Rights from the Chantal Companies, directed the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (S) to BCS, and fronted the negotiations with Nu Skin. When she was diagnosed with metastic colon cancer in September 2015, Chantal, together with her daughter, Heika Burnison (“Heika”), sought an account of the Trust Monies and the Ethocyn Rights. Chantal passed away without an account being rendered by Weber. The plaintiff brought the current suit in the light of the Defendants failure to account for the same.</p>
<p><span>7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In contrast, the Defendants denied there was any kind of agreement between Chantal and Weber. The Defendants’ case was that Chantal wished to sell the Ethocyn Rights held by Renslade (NZ), Weber saw a good business opportunity and agreed to purchase the Ethocyn Rights from Chantal for his own benefit through Renslade (S). Weber had all along been the legal and beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights. Weber denied the existence of the Trust Agreement and asserted that the Defendants did not hold the Ethocyn Rights and Trust Monies on trust for Chantal. Chantal worked for Renslade (S) as a consultant and assisted the Defendants with the exploitation of the Ethocyn Rights. The defendants also pleaded that on the plaintiff’s own case, the Trust Agreement was void for illegality as she hid her ownership of Renslade (NZ) from the US Bankruptcy Court. </p>
<p><span>8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>As regards the CHF9.5 million that Weber withdrew from the Trust Monies, the plaintiff claimed that Chantal had agreed to loan Weber CHF6 million for a period of three years with interest at 3% per annum. Weber however, without Chantal’s knowledge or consent, took CHF 9.5 million from the Trust Monies. In contrast, the Defendants alleged that the sum of CHF9.5 million belonged to Weber and he used it to invest in bonds on behalf of Renslade (S).</p>
<p><span>9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>At the trial, at the close of the Plaintiff’s case, the Defendants elected not to call any evidence and made a submission of no case to answer.</p>
<p><strong>The court’s decision</strong></p>
<p><span>10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>As the Defendants elected not to call evidence at the trial, the test was whether the plaintiff’s evidence at face value established no case in law or whether the evidence led by the plaintiff was so unsatisfactory or unreliable that its burden of proof had not been discharged (at [67]–[69]).</p>
<p><span>11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The Court found that the plaintiff had established, at least, on a <em>prima facie </em>basis the existence of the Trust Agreement. The evidence throughout each stage of the development of the Ethocyn business, to the date of Chantal’s death, pointed to the same conclusion that Chantal had always been the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights, the Trust Assets and Trust Monies. Weber had always been working for Chantal as her trustee and was obliged to account to her in relation to the Trust Monies and Trust Assets (at [187]–[188]).</p>
<p><span>12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The Court found that Weber unilaterally increased the commission due to him as a trustee under the Trust Agreement from 5% to 10% from 2016 to 2017 without Chantal’s knowledge and consent (at [190]).</p>
<p><span>13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The Court found that Weber had asked Chantal for a loan of CHF6 million for a period of three years, with interest at 3% per annum. Chantal had acceded to Weber’s request. Weber however, without Chantal’s knowledge or consent, took CHF9.5 million from the Trust Monies (at [194]–[199]).</p>
<p><span>14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The Court held that Singapore law was the proper law that governed the Trust Agreement as there was an implied choice of Singapore law and it had the closest connection with the Trust Agreement (at [206] and [211]–[214]).</p>
<p><span>15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>There was a valid express trust under Singapore law as Chantal had the requisite intention to form a trust from the time that Renslade (NZ) purchased the assets in the bankruptcy sale (at [219]–[224]). The Trust Agreement was tainted by illegality because Chantal had made false declarations to the US Bankruptcy Court to hide her interest in the Ethocyn Rights (at [261]). Notwithstanding the illegality, the Court found that it was disproportionate to refuse to enforce the Trust Agreement and there was no reason not to enforce it (at [263]–[269]). Alternatively, the plaintiff had a valid cause of action against the defendants on a resulting trust as Weber acquired the Ethocyn Rights for no consideration (at [229] and [275]). </p>
<p><span>16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The Court also considered the validity and enforceability of the Trust Agreement under California law and concluded that it would be recognised as a valid trust under California law (at [240] and [298]).</p>
<p><span>17<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In conclusion, the Court found that the Defendants had breached their fiduciary duties to Chantal by failing to provide an account of the Trust Monies and by unilaterally increasing the commission from 5% to 10% from 2016 to 2017 without Chantal’s knowledge and consent. The Court declared that the Defendants held the Trust Assets and Trust Monies on trust for the estate and had to account for the same. The Court also entered judgment against Weber for the loan of CHF9.5 million together with 3% interest per annum (at [299]–[300]).</p>
