The caveator’s counsel stated that the caveator was not appealing against the dismissal of the stay application, and would not seek to challenge my refusal to grant the stay; rather, the caveator was appealing against an express order that I had supposedly made for the removal of the caveat. However, I made no such order, and the caveat remains on the record.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Be that as it may, in these grounds of decision I will address the reseal of the foreign grant, the dismissal of the stay application, as well as the status of the caveat.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The stay application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The applicant obtained the Vanuatu grant on 10 November 2021, in Vanuatu Probate Case No. 3613 of 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 5 May 2022, the caveator filed Civil Case No. 832 of 2022 in Vanuatu to quash the Vanuatu grant. That was after the caveator had filed his stay application on 27 April 2022 in the caveat proceedings, seeking a stay of the resealing proceedings until the proceedings contesting the Vanuatu grant were concluded.

</div>
</div> He exhibited:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A letter dated 24 October 2022 from the caveator’s Vanuatu lawyer stating that the caveator’s application for leave to appeal out of time (filed on 12 October 2022) would be heard on 16 November 2022.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A Notice of Discontinuance dated 26 October 2022 which was signed by the caveator’s Vanuatu lawyer and filed with the Vanuatu court. Addressed to the applicant, it stated (in relation to the caveator’s purported Vanuatu appeal), “The Appellant have [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] discontinued this proceeding against you.”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Vanuatu court’s handwritten notes dated 27 October 2022 stating that “Applicant for leave to appeal has filed a notice of discontinuance…The application for leave to appeal is marked as withdrawn. There was never any appeal on foot so nothing to discontinue.” The court’s notes further record that “[c]ounsel both attended and confirmed the information and orders set out above.” (A copy of the Vanuatu court’s typed note was shown to me at the hearing on 24 November 2022, and thereafter provided by correspondence on 17 December 2022.) The applicant’s Vanuatu lawyer elaborated in para 9 of his affidavit that at that hearing on 27 October 2022, the caveator’s Vanuatu lawyer “confirmed the matter is closed meaning they will not be seeking to proceed further.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 With the discontinuance of the caveator’s application for leave to appeal on 26 October 2022, as noted by the Vanuatu court on 27 October 2022, the caveator’s attempts to challenge the Vanuatu grant came to an end.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The caveator had only sought to stay the applicant’s application for resealing the Vanuatu grant “until the proceedings contesting the grant in Vanuatu [were] concluded”. Those proceedings were concluded by the time of the November hearing before me. Accordingly, I dismissed the stay application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The resealing application</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable legislation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Section 47 of the Probate and Administration Act 1934 (“the Act”) empowers the Singapore court to reseal letters of administration granted in certain foreign jurisdictions including Vanuatu. When so resealed, the letters of administration shall be of the like force and effect, and have the same operation in Singapore, as if they were granted by the General Division of the High Court to the person by whom or on whose behalf the application for sealing was made (s 47(2) of the Act).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Section 47(4) of the Act provides that “If it appears that the deceased was not, at the time of his death, domiciled within the jurisdiction of the court from which the grant was issued, the seal shall not be affixed unless the grant is such as the General Division of the High Court would have made.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The caveator contended that: (a) the deceased was not domiciled in Vanuatu; and (b) the Vanuatu grant was not one “such as the General Division of the High Court would have made.” On the latter point, the caveator contended that the applicant was not the deceased’s wife, and consequently not a beneficiary of his estate – thus, the Vanuatu court should not have granted her letters of administration, and the Singapore court should not reseal the Vanuatu grant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The ex parte application for resealing the Vanuatu grant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 With the dismissal of his stay application imminent, the caveator sought to stay the resealing application further, on the basis that he had just filed an application to intervene in the resealing application, and could raise further matters for the court’s consideration relating to the deceased’s domicile – that intervention application was accepted as HCF/SUM 366/2022 filed on 29 November 2022. The caveator contended that the court should only proceed to deal with the resealing application if his intervention were not allowed. In effect, he was asking that the resealing application be stayed until the intervention application was dealt with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It would have been incongruous to stay the resealing application on account of an intervention application having been filed, when I had just dismissed the caveator’s stay application (for a stay until the conclusion of the proceedings challenging the Vanuatu grant). Moreover, by the time of the November hearing, the applicant’s resealing application (made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> on 22 February 2022) had already been pending for more than nine months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The caveator offered no explanation why he did not seek to intervene in the resealing application, at an earlier stage. Further, the assistant registrar had at a pre-trial conference (“PTC”) on 5 September 2022 observed that the stay application was for a “stay until proceedings contesting the grant in Vanuatu are concluded” and that the summons “is phrased in such a way that inheritance laws and domicile are not relevant to whether proceedings in Vanuatu are concluded.” Thus, the affidavit of foreign law that the caveator was given leave to file and serve was limited to “the stage of proceedings in Vanuatu and whether proceedings in Vanuatu are concluded”; the assistant registrar did <span class="font-italic">not</span> give the caveator leave to include matters regarding domicile or inheritance laws in that affidavit of foreign law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Despite what had happened at that PTC, the caveator did not seek to broaden his stay application beyond seeking a stay until the conclusion of proceedings in Vanuatu. Instead, the caveator filed and served an affidavit of foreign law (affirmed on 19 September 2022) that included matters regarding domicile and inheritance laws. In response, the applicant submitted that paragraphs 5 to 32 of that affidavit should be expunged and/or wholly disregarded.

In this regard, the applicant said that the caveator was aware that she had married the deceased, and that they were living together with their children as well, and that the caveator would drop by their house from time to time to spend time with the deceased and the children (this may have been a reference to a home in Spain, where they were residing in 2017,

</div> The caveator’s response was simply to “not admit” what the applicant had said; he maintained that the deceased had not spoken (to him) about being married, the deceased lived separately from the applicant, and the applicant had her own home in Spain, rather than a family home with the deceased. The caveator does not however say that the deceased was domiciled in <span class="font-italic">Spain</span> (and neither does the applicant say this).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) <span class="font-underline">Vanuatu citizenship</span>: even if the signature of Mr X as a witness on the Vanuatu citizenship nomination forms were forged (as he asserts), the fact remains that the deceased had sought and obtained Vanuatu citizenship. Furthermore, the deceased was the principal candidate for Vanuatu citizenship, in his application he had named the applicant as his wife, and she had obtained Vanuatu citizenship on that basis. The deceased and the applicant represented to the Vanuatu authorities that they were married parents of their elder child (who was then their only child), and obtained a Vanuatu birth certificate for him. These are all indications of the deceased’s intention to settle in Vanuatu with his wife and children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On the evidence before me at the time of the November hearing, it did not appear that the deceased was domiciled somewhere other than Vanuatu; in particular, it did not appear that the deceased was domiciled in UAE (as the caveator contended). In the circumstances, it was open to me to order that the Vanuatu grant be resealed, and I did so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the circumstances, it was not necessary for me to decide whether, if it appeared that the deceased was <span class="font-italic">not</span> domiciled in Vanuatu, the Vanuatu grant should nevertheless be resealed as a grant “such as the General Division of the High Court would have made”.

Prior to that, the caveat had been effective in ensuring that the foreign grant would not be resealed without notice to the caveator: indeed, the caveator was represented by counsel at the November hearing when I ordered that the Vanuatu grant be resealed. After that point, however, the caveat would have been spent. The fact remains, though, that I never ordered that the caveat be removed – and that purported order is what the caveator says he is appealing against by AD/CA 107/2022 in relation to HCF/CAVP 11/2022.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The assets in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It was common ground that the deceased had money in bank account(s) in Singapore – the applicant said so in her statement accompanying the resealing application, and in his affidavit the caveator likewise referred to the deceased’s having a bank account in Singapore.
