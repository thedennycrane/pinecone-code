When concerns arose regarding the sub-contractor’s ability to pay the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs met with the main contractor and the director of the sub-contractor regarding a direct payment arrangement between the main contractor and the plaintiffs.

Her evidence was that she agreed to this meeting out of goodwill despite the fact that Precise had no obligation to Ten-League, because parties were all working the Project together. According to her, it is Precise’s practice that whenever issues between its sub-contractors and their own sub-sub-contractors or suppliers are brought to Precise’s attention, Precise would try to assist, where possible. This is to ensure that a smooth working relationship is maintained between all parties on the project.

In consideration of this arrangement, Ten-League would refrain from shutting down its machines, so that G-Con could finish its works without delaying Precise’s Project. Further, Ten-League would agree to cap the outstanding rental owed by G-Con to it at $2m.

She said that she was confused because this meant that G-Con would have to be prepared to pay the full $2m to Ten-League.

Mr Choo explained that Mr Jison Lim had contacted him and told him that Ten-League’s auditors required G-Con to issue the 31 Jan G-Con Letter such that Ten-League’s initial public offering exercise (“IPO”) would not be affected. Thus, the 31 Jan G-Con Letter was simply for show. He explained that he signed the 31 Jan G-Con Letter despite disagreeing with its contents because he trusted Mr Jison Lim’s explanation that it was simply to satisfy Ten-League’s auditors.

He understood, based on the terms of the Direct Payment Agreement, that this letter was important to “formalise the payment arrangement and record that G-con expressly authorised Precise to settle its debt to Ten-League on G-Con’s behalf, to avoid any potential action by G-Con against Precise for interfering in its contractual arrangement with Ten-League.”

The Direct Payment Agreement was the culmination of negotiations that had begun as early as 14 January 2020 when it became clear that G-Con would be unable to pay its debt to Ten-League. Accordingly, Ten-League proposed that Precise make direct payment of monies due to G-Con to it instead, and in exchange, Ten-League would agree to allow G-Con to continue to use the Equipment on the Project. Mr Choo agreed on behalf of G-Con because he wanted to complete the works and get paid, such that he could pay G-Con’s creditors.

Ten-League first offered to enter a direct payment agreement at the 14 Jan Meeting, and this was rejected by Precise. Following this, a second offer was made when Ten-League asked Precise to sign the Draft Acknowledgement in response to the 31 Jan G-Con Letter. Again, this was not accepted by Precise. On 3 February 2020, Ten-League made a third, identical, offer, when it sent the 31 Jan Ten-League Letter to Precise over WhatsApp. This time, however, the offer was accompanied by a threat to shut the Equipment down unless Precise agreed by that day. When Ms Poon responded the next day that Precise would “do the necessary”, Ten-League thought that this offer had been accepted. However, Precise instead responded with a counteroffer in the form of the 4 Feb Letter. This counteroffer was not acceptable to Ten-League for the reasons set out in the 4 Feb E-mail. The 6 Feb Meeting was called to resolve the deadlock. Ten-League provides two options to explain what happened at the 6 Feb Meeting. The first is that a firm agreement arose as to the following: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Ten-League would cap any outstanding fees to be incurred at $2m and permit the continued use of machines for the Project; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Precise would agree to make direct payment to Ten-League subject to G-Con’s assessment and confirmation on the amount payable and confirm the other conditions set out in the 4 Feb Letter; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) G-Con was to confirm and provide such an assessment and confirmation on the amount payable, as a condition subsequent for any direct payment. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The second option is that the 6 Feb Meeting culminated in a counteroffer by Precise to confirm the amounts payable and other terms of the 4 Feb Letter. This counter offer was accepted by G-Con in the 7 Feb Letter and impliedly accepted by Ten-League.

First, when it paid the sum of $811,316.78 to G-Con rather than Ten-League on 2 March 2020. Second, when it refused to make further payment to Ten-League despite G-Con’s assessment of the sums payable in the 7 Feb Letter.

</div> It is relatively straightforward to see why the first alleged breach would have been a breach of the Direct Payment Arrangement. The second alleged breach is not so clear. To establish the second alleged breach, Ten-League argues that Precise’s back charges in PC14 and PC15 were illegitimate and not in accordance with the terms of the 4 Feb Letter that formed part of the Direct Payment Agreement.

</div> The only legitimate deductions were the sums of $67,605.24 for PC14 and $93,929.76 for PC15. Thus, Precise was in fact obliged to pay G-Con $355,313.74 under PC14 and $459.270.42 under PC15. Both sums were below the caps stated in the 7 Feb Letter. Thus, these sums should have been paid to Ten-League pursuant to the Direct Payment Agreement.

On Ten-League’s pleaded case, TLC is a party to the Direct Payment Agreement.

In <span class="font-italic">BWG v BWF</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1296 (“<span class="font-italic">BWG</span>”), the Court of Appeal discussed the doctrine of approbation and reprobation in detail. The following propositions which are relevant to this case were set out:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The doctrine can apply to cases involving different proceedings against different parties: at [118]. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The doctrine is engaged as long as the party has received an actual benefit as a result of its earlier inconsistent position: at [118].</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) For the purposes of the doctrine, a judgment is considered a benefit, even where the judgment is ultimately not satisfied. The benefit is the entitlement to payment that the party receives when it obtains the judgment: at [119].</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Thus, because Ten-League obtained a benefit in the form of judgment against G-Con in Suit 226, they may not reprobate from any matter which they relied on to obtain that benefit. This applies to the present suit even though the parties are not identical to those in Suit 226.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Mr Choo points to three categories of inconsistency between Ten-League’s position in these proceedings and its position in Suit 226: inconsistency of parties; inconsistency of factual positions taken on record; and inconsistency of course of action taken.

</div> In my view, none of these inconsistencies enliven the doctrine of approbation and reprobation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In <span class="font-italic">BWG, </span>the Court of Appeal (at [102]) endorsed the description of the doctrine set out in <span class="font-italic">Treasure Valley Group v </span><span class="font-italic">Saputa Teddy and another (Ultramarine Holdings, Ltd, Intervener) </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 358 at [31] by Belinda Ang J (as she then was):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The doctrine of approbation and reprobation precludes a person who has <span class="font-italic">exercised a right</span> from <span class="font-italic">exercising another right which is alternative to and inconsistent with the right he has exercised</span>. It entails, for instance, that a person ‘having accepted a benefit given him by a judgment cannot allege the invalidity of the judgment which conferred the benefit’: see <span class="font-italic">Evans v Bartlam</span> [1937] AC 473 at 483…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in <span class="font-italic">BWG</span>]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, in order for the doctrine to be engaged, Ten-League must be seeking to exercise a <span class="font-italic">right</span> which is inconsistent with the <span class="font-italic">right</span> it exercised in Suit 226. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 To illustrate, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BWG </span>considered (at [103]–[105]) the example of <span class="font-italic">Express Newspapers Plc v News (UK) Ltd and others</span> [1990] 1 WLR 1320 (“<span class="font-italic">Express Newspapers</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Express Newspapers, </span>the plaintiff newspaper had brought an action for breach of copyright against the defendant. The plaintiff had published an article, based on an exclusive interview, and the defendant had published a report of the same story. Some time later, the reverse happened in that the plaintiff republished an exclusive story which the defendant published first. The plaintiff obtained summary judgment, and the defendant sought to enter summary judgment on its counterclaim. The plaintiff objected, but the court considered that the facts of the claim and counterclaim were “legally indistinguishable” and therefore any defence put forward to the counterclaim would be equally applicable to the claim on which the plaintiff had obtained judgment. The plaintiff was not entitled to put forward two inconsistent cases, and summary judgment was granted on the defendant’s counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">Lipkin International Ltd v Swiber Holdings Ltd and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 962 (“<span class="font-italic">Lipkin</span>”), the plaintiff sought to rely on a document to advance a contract, but it had in earlier arbitration proceedings used that same document to advance a different contract with a different party. The doctrine of approbation and reprobation did not apply, but only because the prior arbitration had ultimately settled (and therefore the plaintiff did not “exercise” any right in them). However, the court still frowned upon the plaintiff’s approach and noted that its adoption of inconsistent attitudes should be viewed with circumspection and scepticism due to the “wider dimension” of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation: at [61]–[62].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my view, there is no similar inconsistency here. The Direct Payment Agreement on which Ten-League’s case is premised was allegedly reached orally at a meeting on 6 February 2020. It is a contract that co-existed with the Rental Agreements between G-Con and TLET. In fact, the Direct Payment Agreement was pleaded (albeit not exactly in the same terms) in TLET’s statement of claim in Suit 226. I reproduce the relevant paragraphs of TLET’s statement of claim in Suit 226:

Here, Ten-League asserts a related, but not inconsistent, right that arises from a purported agreement between different parties. The Rental Agreements have been pleaded in this suit and their validity is consistent with Ten-League’s case. Ten-League has stressed that it is not taking the position that the Direct Payment Agreement settles, supersedes or extinguishes G-Con’s debt under the Rental Agreements.

</div> As such, I agree that successfully establishing the Direct Payment Agreement would not in any way undermine the judgment in Suit 226. It is also important to note that Ten-League accepts that the principle of double recovery applies, and therefore any risk in that regard can be dealt with when damages are considered.

The plea of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which [the] parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The doctrine is well-established in Singapore law (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN </span><span class="font-italic">Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1104).

</div> However, the facts giving rise to liability for breach of any Direct Payment Agreement are <span class="font-italic">distinct </span>from those which gave rise to G-Con’s liability under the Rental Agreements. This is unlike <span class="font-italic">Manas Kumar Ghosh v MSI Ship Management Pte Ltd and others </span>[2021] 4 SLR 935 (“<span class="font-italic">Manas Kumar Ghosh</span>”) which Mr Choo cites. In <span class="font-italic">Manas Kumar Ghosh</span>, the plaintiff suffered injuries while working on board a vessel. He first commenced a suit against the owner of the vessel in negligence, which was ultimately settled. Six months later, he brought another suit, also in negligence, in respect of the same injury, against two ship managers of the vessel. There, the court rightly noted that the plaintiff was “covering the same ground already traversed” in the previous suit. In this case, however, it cannot be said that the existence of the Direct Payment Agreement was traversed in Suit 226. As I have covered at [69] above, I do not see the present claim to be inconsistent with that in Suit 226.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Mr Choo also argues that this is a collateral attack on the decision in Summons 1449 as it is a “backdoor means of enforcing the [judgment in Suit 226]”.

Counsel for Ten-League explained that the term “tripartite” was appropriate because TLET and TLC were acting collectively as a group.

</div> In any event, the number of alleged parties to the contract does not materially affect the contractual analysis. In <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve</span><span class="font-italic"> Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 63 (<span class="font-italic">“CCRB</span>”), there was alleged to have been an agreement entered into between three parties (at [9]). In setting out the relevant principles, the Court of Appeal did not consider any rule that set tripartite agreements apart from bilateral agreements (at [46]–[50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As recognised in <span class="font-italic">KLW Holdings Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Straitsworld Advisory Ltd and another </span>[2017] 5 SLR 184 (“<span class="font-italic">KLW Holdings</span>”) at [54] (citing <span class="font-italic">Malayan Banking </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Lauw Wisanggeni </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 287 at [12]), there is no requirement in tripartite agreements that consideration must benefit each and every other party. This flows from the trite principle that, while consideration must move from the promisor, it need not necessarily move to the promisee. Thus, in respect of the requirement of consideration, Ten-League simply must show that consideration was provided by each of the alleged parties to the Direct Payment Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The evidence adduced at trial, however, shows that the Direct Payment Agreement was not reached. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The contemporaneous documentary evidence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 On Ten-League’s case, negotiations leading up to the Direct Payment Agreement began on 14 January 2020.

The 31 Jan G-Con Letter was a <span class="font-italic">request</span> by <span class="font-italic">G-Con</span> that Precise make direct payment to Ten-League (see [15] above).

This is especially so given Precise’s use of words such as “consideration” and <br/>“warrants”, as well as the manner in which Precise’s obligations under the Direct Payment Agreement are framed. This language appears to at least raise the possibility that the Draft Acknowledgement would constitute a binding agreement between G-Con and Precise that was enforceable by Ten-League. On Ten-League’s case, the Draft Acknowledgement was a letter which recognised a direct payment agreement between Precise, G-Con and Ten-League.

This is unlike the Draft Acknowledgement, where Precise <span class="font-italic">promised</span> to perform G-Con’s request.

Specifically, there was no reference to “TLC agreeing to continue leasing their equipment to [G-Con] so that [the Project] can be completed in time”, as there was in the Draft Acknowledgement. On Ten-League’s case, the 4 Feb Letter was a counteroffer by Precise (see [40] above). It is curious that Precise’s counteroffer does not even refer to Ten-League’s alleged end of the contractual bargain. In any case, Ten-League’s characterisation of the 4 Feb Letter as a counteroffer is unconvincing. An offer “must consist of a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted”: <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [47]. The 4 Feb Letter contained no such promise to be bound, much less a promise to be bound <span class="font-italic">to Ten-League. </span>While the 4 Feb Letter was sent by e-mail to Ten-League, it was not even addressed to them. There was nothing in the 4 Feb Letter that could possibly objectively show that Precise intended to be bound upon acceptance of its conditions stated in the letter. Ten-League was aware of this (see [89] above). Thus, the 4 Feb Letter could not have been accepted to form a binding agreement<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Overseas Union Insurance Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Turegum Insurance Co</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 285 at [28]), and therefore cannot be considered a counteroffer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I pause to note that parties appear to take a different interpretation of para 2(b) of the 4 Feb Letter. Ten-League takes this para to provide only that “there would be no sub-contract relationship (as opposed to a contractual relationship arising from the terms of any direct payment arrangement itself) between Precise and [Ten-League] such that [Ten-League] would be considered a sub-contractor of Precise”.

</div> Ten-League appears to be drawing a distinction between a <span class="font-italic">sub-contractual </span>relationship and a <span class="font-italic">contractual </span>relationship. In essence, Ten-League submits that para 2(b) does not amount to an expression of Precise’s intention that there should be no contract between Precise and Ten-League. I wholly reject this suggestion as it is contrived and unsupported by evidence. As stated at [78(f)] above, it is important that the court should not place undue weight on specific words used by witnesses who are not legally trained. Ms Poon explained that, as per Precise’s usual practice with direct payment arrangements, “all obligations under Precise’s sub-contracts would remain unchanged and <span class="font-italic">no new contractual relationship between Precise and the suppliers would be created</span>” [emphasis added].

</div> In fact, Ten-League’s <span class="font-italic">own witness</span><span class="font-italic">’s evidence</span> (at [89] above) supports this interpretation. In oral closing submissions, Ten-League’s counsel appeared to have dropped this contention when he accepted that until 4 February 2020, it was clear to Ten-League that Precise did not want to enter into a contract with it, but that this understanding ceased by the time of the 6 Feb Meeting.

However, I should note that the 4 Feb E-mail does not raise concerns about the fact that the 4 Feb Letter clearly does not contemplate Precise undertaking an obligation to make direct payment. According to Ten-League, “anything short of an enforceable agreement would have been commercially meaningless”.

</div> Mr Lim Teck Meng’s evidence is that the letter was “lacking in substance” and complained of its “vagueness”. Essentially, the 4 Feb Letter was unsatisfactory to him because “Precise proposed only to pay Ten-League any amount that G-Con had agreed for them to pay on their behalf, without mentioning that G-Con had agreed to do so.”

</div> In closing submissions, it confirms that the 7 Feb Letter was either: an assessment and confirmation pursuant to the Direct Payment Agreement; or an acceptance of an offer made by Precise at the 6 Feb Meeting (see [40] above). Thus, in all the forms of Ten-League’s case, the 7 Feb Letter is consistent with the Direct Payment Arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 A few conclusions can be drawn from the 7 Feb Letter. First, as suggested by the phrase “if the amount payable to me is less than $2m”, the precise amount payable by Precise to G-Con pursuant to the G-Con Sub-contract had not been determined. Second, even following the 6 Feb Meeting, the terms stated in the 4 Feb Letter were “acceptable”. Finally, and most importantly, the 7 Feb Letter directly addresses Ten-League’s two concerns stated in the 4 Feb E-mail. There was now a stipulated timeline of three instalments of direct payments. There was also a confirmation from G-Con of the amounts that Precise was authorised to directly pay to Ten-League. This directly addressed Ten-League’s concern that the 4 Feb Letter provided that direct payments were subject to G-Con’s confirmation and assessment. Now, Precise was authorised to pay Ten-League specified amounts. It is a fair inference that these two points were ironed out in the meeting the day before. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The importance of the 7 Feb Letter was not lost on Mr Lim Teck Meng, who drafted the letter himself:

Ms Poon replied on 17 March with a robust rejection of its content. It is not reliable evidence of any agreement reached by parties on 6 February. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In my view, the picture that emerges from the documentary evidence is clear. Ten-League wished to obtain direct payment from Precise. It threatened to shut the Equipment down in order to convince Precise to do so. Ten-League’s first aim was to obtain an agreement from Precise that it could enforce, and it sought to do so in the Draft Acknowledgement. Precise did not agree. However, Precise was not opposed to providing Ten-League with direct payment, as long as it was not obliged to do so and any arrangement remained solely between it and G-Con. Precise set this out in the 4 Feb Letter. While this was not <span class="font-italic">exactly</span> what Ten-League wanted (because it was not an enforceable agreement), it was still acceptable and commercially meaningful to Ten-League because it still meant that Precise was likely to make direct payment to it (see [119] below). After all, Precise had the means to pay, was a reputable company, and entered direct payment arrangements (on a gratuitous promise basis) with other parties. Also, there was no incentive for Precise not to carry out the direct payment because it owed that money to G-Con anyway. However, the problem for Ten-League was that it did not want the amount that G-Con was prepared to allow to be paid directly to Ten-League to be up in the air with no timeline. Thus, the two concerns in the 4 Feb E-mail were raised. This problem was presumably addressed by parties at the 6 Feb Meeting, because the 7 Feb Letter came the day after, drafted by Ten-League, accepting the terms of the 4 Feb Letter but confirming the specific amounts that G-Con was prepared to pay Ten-League and the appropriate timeline.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The documentary evidence therefore reflects that no tripartite oral agreement was reached between parties at the 6 Feb Meeting. Parties went into the 6 Feb Meeting with Precise having clearly expressed its position that it would not be entering into a contract with Ten-League. Even so, the arrangement carried commercial benefit to Ten-League, who accepted that the arrangement would be on the terms of the 4 February letter. This was expressed in the 7 Feb Letter which Ten-League drafted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ten-League’s oral evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Three Ten-League witnesses were present at the 6 Feb Meeting: Mr Lim Teck Meng, Mr Jison Lim and Ms Zhang. All three gave the same account of the meeting. The main agenda of the meeting was to “discuss Ten-League’s shutting down of the Equipment”.

In fact, it runs contrary to what was pleaded in the Reply, which was that the Direct Payment Agreement was for set amounts to be paid according to a timeline.

Precise could only advise on the amount payable to G-Con when it issued its subsequent payment certificates. Further, she told them that any direct payment agreement would be subject to the terms and conditions set out in the 4 Feb Letter, including that such arrangement is solely between Precise and G-Con.

This was in any case likely to be true, because the G-Con Sub-contract was a measurement contract (see [4] above). The fact that Precise did not object to the 7 Feb Letter despite the fact that it contained specific sums payable at specific dates can be explained by the qualifier that immediately followed: “If the amount payable to me is less than $2m, please make whatever amount available to TLG.” Thus, these specific sums adding up to $2m were simply the <span class="font-italic">maximum</span> that Precise was <span class="font-italic">authorised</span> to pay to Ten-League, rather than sums that they were <span class="font-italic">obliged </span>to pay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Thus, I accept the evidence of Precise’s witnesses regarding the 6 Feb Meeting.

The documentary evidence makes clear Precise’s position not to enter a contract with Ten-League. Precise was adamant that any arrangement would be between itself and G-Con only, and recorded this in the 4 Feb Letter. This aspect of the 4 Feb Letter was not rejected or clarified by Ten-League in any of the written correspondence, nor in the 7 Feb Letter which Mr Lim Teck Meng drafted <span class="font-italic">after </span>the 6 Feb Meeting. Parties went into the 6 Feb Meeting with Precise’s clear position in mind, and any “agreement” could only have been in the context of the 4 Feb Letter and therefore non-binding.

On the other hand, Ten-League’s account was not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Two consequences follow from this conclusion.

</div> Thus, I do not proceed to consider whether there was an unlawful means conspiracy to injure Ten-League. The suit against Mr Choo is dismissed on this basis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was there a contract between Precise and G-Con that was enforceable by Ten-League?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Ten-League makes an alternative argument that if the Direct Payment Agreement was concluded only between Precise and G-Con on the terms as set out exclusively in the 4 Feb Letter and as accepted by the 7 Feb Letter, Ten-League may still sue to enforce the terms of that agreement which confer on them a benefit. Ten-League relies on s 2 of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap 53B, 2002 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 There is no factual basis for this argument. For there to be a contract enforceable by Ten-League, there must be a contract between Precise and G-Con. However, there is no evidence of such a contract between Precise and G-Con. First, as discussed at [88] above, the 4 Feb Letter is clear that it does not create any obligation on Precise to make direct payment to Ten-League. This is made clear from Precise’s statement that it was agreeing to assist in making direct payments to Ten-League “purely to assist [G-Con]’s cash flow and <span class="font-italic">without any obligation to do so</span>” [emphasis added]. To my mind, this makes clear that Precise did not make a “definite promise to be bound” and there was therefore no offer capable of giving rise to a contract between it and G-Con (see [90] above). Further, this makes clear that Precise did not intend, by this arrangement (if it were ever to materialise), to create any legal relations with G-Con. And as I have found at [112] above, the terms of the 4 Feb Letter persisted throughout parties’ discussions. Second, even on Ten-League’s case, the main motivation for Precise entering any Direct Payment Agreement was to secure Ten-League’s continued leasing of the Equipment to G-Con such that the Project would not be delayed. A contract only between Precise and G-Con would not result in Ten-League being obliged to do so. There is therefore no reason why Precise would enter such an agreement. Precise has been clear that in the 4 Feb Letter it simply consented to an arrangement that had been proposed by G-Con. This explanation is consistent with the contents of the 4 Feb Letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Ten-League points to a statement by Ms Poon in her affidavit filed in Summons 1449 and argues that she “confirmed on affidavit … that the Direct Payment Agreement was entered into, and the only dispute is the parties – whether it included [Ten-League].”

</div> I do not accept Ten-League’s claim in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 At the outset, there is no factual basis to Ten-League’s assertion that Precise requested that Ten-League continue leasing the Equipment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In any event, whether Precise had requested for Ten-League to not demobilise the machine is irrelevant to the analysis of whether a claim for unjust enrichment is made out. In this regard, the elements that a plaintiff must establish in an unjust enrichment claim are (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Swimming Club v Koh Sin Chong Freddie </span>[2016] 3 SLR 845 (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Swimming Club</span>”) at [90]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) a benefit has been conferred on, or an enrichment has accrued to the defendant; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the benefit was conferred at the expense of the plaintiff; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the enrichment was unjust. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is immediately clear that there was no enrichment that was unjust. Precise and G-Con had a contract, pursuant to which any work done by G-Con was paid for by Precise. In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Swimming Club </span>at [92]–[93], the Court of Appeal emphasised that unjust enrichment is not based on a general or broad notion of unconscionability or unjustness. Thus, in order to establish the third element above, a plaintiff must identify <span class="font-italic">specific</span> grounds of restitution, which are legally recognised factors that make the defendant’s enrichment unjust and are thus often referred to as “unjust factors”. Ten-League has not pleaded any such unjust factor underlying its claim in <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 For these reasons, I dismiss the suit against both defendants.
