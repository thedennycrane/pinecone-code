<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1

        This is an appeal pursuant to s 35 of the

Property Tax Act ("the Act") against the decisions of the Valuation Review Board

in VRB Appeal Nos 252-255 and 282-304 of 1999. All the decisions turn on the same issue

and they have been dealt with collectively by the Board in its Grounds of Decision dated

16 May 2002. They turn on the same facts and I shall also deal with them together.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The Appellant is the owner, operator and

landlord of the shopping centre known as Parco Bugis Junction ("the Shopping

Centre"). It has approximately 203 shop units which are let out to 168 tenants under

written leases. The anchor tenants are Seiyu, a department store, and United Artists, a

multi-screen cinema complex. The subject matter of the present appeals pertain to 27 of

the non-anchor shop units.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        The Shopping Centre opened for business in

1995. From then until sometime in 1997, the Appellant signed leases with its tenants in a

form that I shall term the Old Lease and after 1997, in a new form that I shall call the

New Lease. The New Lease comprised a lease agreement (the "Agreement") and a

Memorandum of Supplemental Lease Terms (the "Memorandum") which was made

applicable to the Agreement by clause 2.2 of the Agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        The payments by each of the Appellant’s

tenants under its lease comprise four components, viz.:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i)

          "Basic Rent" which is a fixed sum

  payable monthly computed on a per square metre basis as negotiated and agreed between the

  Appellant and the tenant.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii)

          "Additional Rent" which is the agreed

  percentage of the tenant’s gross sales from the retail unit and which is negotiated

  and agreed between the Appellant and the tenant.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii)

          "Tenant’s Contribution" being

  the tenant’s contribution towards the expenses for cleaning and maintenance services

  provided by the Appellant to the common areas of the Shopping Centre. Unlike the Basic

  Rent and Additional Rent, it is a fixed rate of $16.15 per square metre for all tenants

  (subject to increase).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iv)

          "A&amp;P Contribution", expressed in

  the lease as <i><b>"the fees payable by the Tenant to the Landlord for advertising

  and promotion as provided in the Lease"</b></i>. Like the Tenant’s Contribution

  it is a fixed rate and is set at $3.23 per square metre (subject to a minimum of $100.00

  and subject to increase).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        The provisions relating to A&amp;P

Contributions in both the Old Lease and the New Lease are almost identical. In the Old

Lease, these provisions are set out in Schedule 6. In the Agreement, they are found in

clause 6. There are minor differences in the A&amp;P Contribution provisions in the two

leases. The principal difference is that  1.1 of Schedule 6 of the Old Lease mentions

that the payment of the A&amp;P Contribution is "by way of additional rent" but

this statement is not found in clause 6.1 of the Agreement. However, clause 6.5.2 of the

Memorandum provides that all monies payable under the New Lease shall be deemed to be rent

in law. Nothing turns on the differences.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The Chief Assessor’s assessments of the

Annual Value of each of the 27 shop units were based on the actual rates paid of Basic

Rent, Additional Rent and A&amp;P Contribution, and did not include the Tenant’s

Contribution. The Appellant was dissatisfied with the inclusion of the A&amp;P

Contribution, and before the Board submitted that it ought to be excluded. The Board

dismissed the appeals and the Appellant now appeals before me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        The following facts were disclosed in the

Appellant’s affidavits which were not challenged by the Chief Assessor:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)

          The A&amp;P Contribution payments were utilised

  by the Appellant to help defray its costs in carrying out advertising and promotion

  ("A&amp;P") activities for the Shopping Centre. For such purposes, the Appellant

  incurred about $2 million each year. However the total collection in respect of A&amp;P

  Contributions amounted to approximately $500,000, about a quarter of the actual A&amp;P

  expenses.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b)

          The A&amp;P Contributions were paid by all

  tenants except the two anchor tenants, Seiyu and United Artists.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c)

          The Appellant has an A&amp;P Team who work with

  an advertising agency. The team’s role is to co-ordinate the promotional activities

  for the benefit of the tenants. These activities included staging events, conducting lucky

  draws and running media advertisements. As many as five promotional programmes are

  conducted annually in the Shopping Centre to draw shoppers to it. There are also numerous

  activities, events and promotions organised throughout the year in the Shopping Centre.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        The appeal turns on the interpretation of the

term "annual value" in the Act. Section 2 thereof defines it as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"annual value" — </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)    in relation

      to a house or building or land or tenement … means the gross amount at which the same

      can reasonably be expected to be let from year to year, the landlord paying the expenses

      of repair, insurance, maintenance or upkeep and all taxes (other than goods and services

      tax); …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The question is whether the

A&amp;P Contribution is a part of the gross amount that a shop unit can reasonably be

expected to be let. I turn to consider the relevant authorities on this question.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        In <i>Chartered Bank v The City Council of

Singapore</i> (1959) SPTC 1 the High Court dealt with an appeal against assessments made

by the City Council of certain premises owned by the bank. The assessment for each unit

was based on the gross rent received. The High Court allowed deductions to be made from

the gross rent of expenses incurred by the landlord for watchmen, cleaning, lifts,

air-conditioning and supervision. In addition the Court allowed a deduction of a 15%

loading over those costs, being a reasonable return on the landlord’s outlay to

provide such services. The Court also allowed the deduction of the depreciation of the

lifts, air-conditioner and fire extinguishers. This case is authority for the proposition

that the costs of providing services of watching, cleaning, lifts, air-conditioning and

supervision are deductible from the gross rent to compute the annual value under the Act.

Also deductible is a reasonable return on the landlord’s outlay to provide such

services.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        In <i>Bell Property Trust, Limited v Assessment

Committee for the Borough of Hampstead</i> [1940] 2 KB 543, the landlords of a block of

flats let to tenants under agreements providing for payment by the tenants of a

comprehensive sum, described as rent, for the occupation of the flats and the benefit of

services and amenities such as hot water, central heating and other services usually

provided in high class service flats. The English Court of Appeal held that the cost to

the landlords of providing those services was deductible from the gross rent before

arriving at the gross value of each flat for insertion in the valuation list. The court

also held that such deductions might properly include (i) an allowance for a reasonable

profit to the landlords on the provisions of such services, and (ii) the cost of repair to

and maintenance of the part of the building not demised to tenants, such as passages,

stairs, lifts and staff rooms. The statutory provision considered was s 4 of the Valuation

(Metropolis) Act 1869 which is similar in all respects with the corresponding provision in

the Act, and which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The term ‘gross value’

    means the annual rent which a tenant might reasonably be expected, taking one year with

    another, to pay for an hereditament, if the tenant undertook to pay all usual

    tenant’s rates and taxes, and tithe commutation rent charge, if any, and if the

    landlord undertook to bear the cost of the repairs and insurance, and the other expenses,

    if any, necessary to maintain the hereditament in a state to command that rent.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        The judgment of the English Court of Appeal was

read by Goddard LJ. After referring to the statutory definition of "gross value"

he set out the historical context at p 551:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    Now the difficulty, if difficulty there be, is one which is familiar to every one of

    experience in rating law. The definition is in substance taken from the Parochial

    Assessment Act 1836, which in turn gave statutory authority to the method of valuation

    which had been generally adopted for many years before that Act was passed. When rateable

    hereditaments consisted only of houses, mills, shops, farms, and such like properties, the

    ascertainment of annual value was comparatively simple, but changing conditions in

    industrial and social life brought about many complications, and to apply this definition

    to railways, sewers, gasworks, and other public utility undertakings was difficult in the

    extreme. In spite of appeals from the courts, Parliament, however, gave no assistance by

    clarifying the position by legislation. It preserved the definition in further Acts, such

    as the one which we are now considering, the Union Assessment Committee Act 1862, and,

    indeed, in the recent Act of 1925, which, while effecting many great and fundamental

    changes in rating practice and law, left this matter unaltered. Accordingly, the ingenuity

    of rating surveyors was directed to devising various methods and formul whereby a

    notional annual value could be attributed to rateable properties which in fact could have

    no annual value in the ordinary sense, and, as the courts gave their approval to these

    methods, which from their nature could only be highly artificial, so they took their place

    in the law of rating. Thus was evolved, to take only two instances, the contractors’

    theory, as it is called, and also the profits basis, for public utility corporations with

    property in more than one parish.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        Goddard LJ drew a distinction between the rent

and remuneration for services and amenities provided to the tenant by the landlord,

saying:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… While it does not follow

    that the actual rent paid by a tenant is the legal measure of the rent which the

    hypothetical tenant would pay, no question of this sort arises here, as the surveyors on

    both sides evidently considered that the actual rents reserved were what a hypothetical

    tenant would pay, and the questions raised by the special case turn entirely on the issue

    as to what portion of the gross sums payable by the tenants was actually for rents and how

    much was remuneration for services, or consideration for services and amenities provided

    for the tenants by the landlord.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        The judge drew the analogy of the provision of

furniture in a furnished flat, reasoning as follows at p 554:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… Here we have a gross sum

    paid by the tenant not only for the occupation of the flat, but also for the various

    services and amenities provided. We can see no difference in principle between such a case

    as this and the letting of a furnished flat. In the latter case the law is well settled

    that you must ascertain how much is paid in respect of the furniture and the things in no

    way forming part of the rateable premises, such as the rates, which are usually paid by

    the landlord who lets furnished, and the remainder represents the rent of the house

    itself, for which it is rateable: <i>Reg. v Lee</i>. Exactly to the same effect is Lord

    Fleming’s opinion in <i>M’Ewan v Glasgow Assessor</i>, where the question for

    decision was much the same as in the present case. He said: "The yearly rent or value

    of a flat ….. was the proportion of the gross rent paid to the owner which could

    fairly be attributed to the occupation of the heritable subject." Having then pointed

    out that the gross rent, by which he means the actual sum paid by the tenant, includes

    various services, he continues: "The tenants periodically pay a lump sum for the

    personal services and for the use of the heritable subject, and the problem, accordingly,

    is to ascertain the proportion of the cumulo payment which effeirs to the heritable

    subject." From these cases, with which we entirely agree, it appears that not only

    did the rating surveyors and the assessment committee approach the problem correctly, but

    so did quarter sessions. They set out to find what proportion of the sums reserved by the

    leases as rent represented the value of the services and amenities provided by the

    lessors, and deducting that and the rates, the balance left represented the true gross

    value. The hypothetical tenant, of course, is not concerned with what it costs the

    landlord to provide these services. He considers only what he can afford to pay for the

    sum of what he gets - namely, a flat to live in, together with such services and other

    attractions as may be offered. A man who feels he can pay a rent of about 250, and has

    been paying that in an old-fashioned flat with open fireplaces, where the water has to be

    heated in the kitchen, may well feel that he can pay, say, 275 or 300 for one in which

    he will be provided with domestic hot water and central heating. He will not concern

    himself with what it costs the landlord to provide those services, but it is none the less

    true that what he pays for the use of the flat itself is the rent reserved less a proper

    remuneration to the landlord for providing him with hot water in his taps and in his

    radiators.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        From this it can be seen that the concept of

rent in respect of annual value concerns the use or occupation of the heritable subject

and this is separate from the provision of other services and amenities.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        Interestingly, the Court of Appeal overruled <i>Pullen

v St Saviour’s Union</i> [1900] 1 QB 138, in which the facts are similar to the

present case. There the landlord had collected weekly payments from tenants of about 10

shillings for rent and another sixpence for cleaning and lighting the staircase. The court

in <i>Pullen’s case</i> had held that the sixpence was part of rent. Lord Goddard

observed at p 554 of the judgment in <i>Bell Property Trust</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… <i>Pullen’s case</i>

    has never been followed, and authors of works on this branch of the law have expressed

    doubts as to its correctness. Charles J in the court below, said that it appeared to be

    contrary to what he had always believed to be the law, and we must see exactly what the

    court in that case decided. The facts were that working-class tenements were let to

    tenants at rents of 8<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i> to 10<i>s</i> per week. Each tenant, on taking a

    tenement, was told that he would have to pay 6<i>d</i> per week to the landlord’s

    collector, in addition to the rent, and out of these sixpences the collector arranged for

    the cleaning and the lighting of the staircase. Quarter sessions held that the 6<i>d</i>

    ought to be regarded as part of the rent, and the court upheld them. In our opinion, the

    decision was wrong, and the law is correctly stated in the argument for the appellant,

    which is clearly and concisely set out in the report. A tenant, knowing that he would have

    to pay this levy of 6<i>d</i> per week, would take that into account when considering what

    rent he could afford to pay, and we can see no ground for holding that the 6d was part of

    the rent, and not payment for services. We think that this case should be overruled.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        In the present case, the Appellant had

collected an additional $3.23 per square metre (subject to a minimum of $100) each month

for A&amp;P activities. This is known right at the outset by the tenant and he would have

done his sums as to whether the Appellant’s offer in its entirety was acceptable,

including the knowledge that there would be a certain amount of A&amp;P activities that

would be carried out and financed in part or in whole by the A&amp;P Contributions. The

provision of A&amp;P activities by the landlord is no different from the provision of the

other services where the Courts have permitted deductions in the <i>Chartered Bank case</i>

and the <i>Bell Property Trust case</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        It is well known that in order for a shopping

centre to be successful in these times it has to continually maintain or even renew its

image and attractions. This is achieved principally through advertising in various media

combined with the holding of a variety of promotions. This would implant in the mind of

the public an awareness of the shopping centre and attract shoppers to the premises. Such

expenditure is usually of a continuing nature, especially in view of the keen competition

between shopping centres. The successful implementation of A&amp;P activities could go a

long way in attracting custom to the shops in the premises thus raising the profitability

of those shops and in turn the rent that the landlord would be able to charge upon the

renewal of the leases. Therefore such services are probably as essential to the tenants as

the traditional ones such as watching, cleaning and air-conditioning. In my view the

principles of valuation should take into account modern developments so as not to stifle

business innovation and creativity. The same approach was taken 60 years ago by the

English Court of Appeal in the <i>Bell Property Trust case</i> and the following comments

Goddard LJ (at p 552) are just as applicable today:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    The development of flats as a normal class of dwelling both in London and the provinces

    brought other problems, and that with which we are now concerned arises from the fact that

    modern flat dwellers expect, and owners vie with each other in providing, a variety of

    services and amenities unknown to an earlier generation. Whereas the provision of a lift

    and the attendance of a porter in uniform may have been all the service that was usually

    furnished by a flat owner thirty years ago, constant domestic hot water, central heating,

    a tastefully furnished garden, radio relayed to each flat from a station in the building,

    and perhaps a swimming-pool, are nowadays among the attractions which may be, and often

    are, offered to a prospective tenant. In some cases which have come before the courts,

    usually in connection with service flats, separate agreements, stipulating for separate

    payments, are made with regard to certain of these amenities, and in others, as in the

    present case, the tenant pays a gross sum, which includes the rent and the privilege of

    enjoying the services and amenities provided.</font></p>

        The Chief Assessor raised the issue, if the

A&amp;P Contributions were allowed to be deducted, of the evidence necessary to show that

these were <i>bona fide</i> A&amp;P Contributions. But that is a question of fact, not

principle. If the owner can satisfy the Chief Assessor, in relation to the A&amp;P

Contributions, that: (i) it was reasonable to provide those services; (ii) the tenants had

agreed to pay for such services; (iii) the services were in fact provided; and (iv) the

costs of providing them were reasonably incurred, then he ought to deduct such sums from

the gross rent in arriving at the annual value. It is always open to the Chief Assessor to

disallow anything that he deems to be unreasonably incurred. This was done in the <i>Chartered

Bank case</i> where the landlord made a claim of a loading of 25% on the costs of

providing watchmen, cleaning, lifts, air-conditioning, supervision, etc. The High Court

held that it was proper and reasonable for the landlord to provide those services and want

a return on his outlay, but ruled that the claim of 25% was too high and allowed a loading

of 15%.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19

        The Chief Assessor also argued that the

Appellant had no obligation under the leases to use the A&amp;P Contributions for A&amp;P

activities only. The Board had agreed with him and had said this in  25 of its Grounds

of Decision:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25

            The greatest flaw of the Appellant’s case,

    however, was that there was no legal obligation of the Appellant to provide any A&amp;P

    services. It was entirely up to the Appellant what they wanted to do with the A&amp;P

    Contribution collected. Even if there was an expectation by the tenants that the Appellant

    would engage in the activities, there remained no legal obligation for them to do so under

    the agreements. The tenants had no recourse against the Appellant under the agreements if

    he (sic) did not do so. This distinguished the present case from the [<i>Chartered Bank

    case</i> and the <i>Bell Property Trust case</i>].</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20

        The Board did not elaborate on the basis upon

which it arrived at this conclusion. The Chief Assessor had submitted to the Board that 

1.2 of Schedule 6 of the Old Lease gives the Landlord the sole discretion in the use of

the A&amp;P Contributions. Presumably the Board had agreed with this submission. That

provision of the Old Lease (viz. Schedule 6,  1.2) states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Landlord shall be entitled at

    its sole discretion to utilise the A &amp; P Contributions collected from all tenants for

    the advertising and promotion of the Retail Area in such manner as the Landlord may

    determine.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the Agreement, a virtually

identical provision is found in clause 6.2 which states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Landlord shall be entitled at

    its sole discretion to utilise the A &amp; P Contribution towards the costs of advertising

    and promotion of the Retail Area in such manner as the Landlord may determine.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21

        With respect to the Board, this would be a

misinterpretation of those provisions. On a close scrutiny, it is clear that they give the

Landlord the discretion to apply, in such manner as he may determine, the A&amp;P

Contributions <u>towards the costs of A&amp;P</u>. Those provisions do not empower him to

apply those funds towards the costs of anything else. Read with the definition of

"A&amp;P Contribution" as <i><b>"</b>the fees payable by the Tenant to the

Landlord for advertising and promotion as provided in the Lease"</i>, it is clear

that there is an obligation on the part of the Landlord to use those funds for A&amp;P

activities. But he is vested with the sole discretion to apply it for those activities in

such manner as he deems fit; no doubt a very important discretion to have in view of the

fact that there are more than a hundred tenants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22

        Finally I turn to the question whether the sum

of about $500,000 claimed by the Appellant is reasonable. The Chief Assessor did not

challenge the Appellant’s contention that it spent about $2 million on A&amp;P

activities, a much greater sum than the total of the A&amp;P Contributions. The tenants

had agreed to pay these sums to the Appellant for such services, which were provided to

them in the form of the A&amp;P activities at a cost about four times the collection. In

the circumstances, I would hold that the Appellant has proved that the A&amp;P

Contributions were reasonably incurred.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23

        I therefore allow the appeals and hold that the

A&amp;P Contributions collected by the Appellant ought not to be included for the purposes

of the determination of annual values of the properties the subject of the present

appeals. Pursuant to s 35(5) of the Act, I direct that the Valuation List be amended by

deducting the corresponding A&amp;P Contributions in respect of those properties. The

parties have advised me that the Appellant has paid the Property Tax based on original

assessments. It follows that there shall be an order to the Chief Assessor to refund the

differences and to pay the Appellant the statutory interest under s 33(1)(4) of the Act at

the rate of 6% per annum on those sums. </font></p>
