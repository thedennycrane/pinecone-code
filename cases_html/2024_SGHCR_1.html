This Suit arose out of the defendants’ diagnosis of the claimant with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (“T2DM”) and their treatment (or alleged treatment) of the claimant for T2DM and a fall in 2015. The claimant claims that, as a result, he suffers several side effects and is permanently unable to seek gainful employment.

After the tests were done again, his result on the HbA1c test was 13.4% and his random glucose was 26.5 which confirmed his diagnosis of T2DM. The first defendant reiterated the diagnosis of T2DM to the claimant and referred the claimant to the fourth defendant for management of the claimant’s “large abscess over back” and “newly diagnosed [T2DM] with uncontrolled hyperglycemia”.

The Medical Negligence Protocol explains that a medical report and medical records of the patient are often essential for a claimant to consider whether he or she has a viable claim or cause of action against his or her doctor and/or hospital (at para 1). Thus, claimants are expected to file and serve the main documents relied on in support of the claim including expert reports (at para 4). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The claimant did not file and serve any expert report in support of his claim when this Suit was commenced.

O 9 r 16(1) of the ROC 2021 is identical in effect to O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court 2014 (“ROC 2014”), except that O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2021 replaces O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC 2014 to build in the Ideals set out in O 3 r 1 of the ROC 2021, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to do what the interests of justice requires (<span class="font-italic">Tiger Pictures Entertainment Ltd v Encore Films Pte Ltd </span>[2023] SGHC 255 at [16] citing <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rules of Court: A Practice Guide</span> (Chua Lee Ming <span class="font-italic">et al</span> eds) (Academy Publishing, 2023) at para 09.051).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The General Division of the High Court, in <span class="font-italic">Leong Quee </span><span class="font-italic">Ching Karen v Lim Soon Huat and others </span>[2022] SGHC 309 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Quee Ching Karen</span>”) at [25]–[26], set out the following general guidance on the law on striking out: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it is trite that the bar for succeeding in a striking out application is a high one. The power to strike out is “very sparingly exercised, and only [applied] in very exceptional cases” and would not be justified “merely because the story told in the pleadings was highly improbable, and one which it was difficult to believe could be proved” (<span class="font-italic">Wing Joo Loong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [172]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the applicant in a striking out application bears the burden of proving that the claim is “obviously unsustainable, the pleadings [are] unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed before the court will strike it out” (<span class="font-italic">Koh Kim Teck v Credit Suisse AG, Singapore Branch</span> [2015] SGHC 52 at [21] and <span class="font-italic">Bank of China Ltd, Singapore Branch v BP Singapore Pte Ltd and others</span> [2021] 5 SLR 738 at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The tests for establishing each ground of O 9 r 16(1) of the ROC 2021 are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the test is whether the action has some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleadings are concerned (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat and others v Attorney-General and another</span> [2022] 2 SLR 1018 (“<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat</span>”) at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), the test is whether the pleadings constitute an abuse of process of the court. The court will consider whether the process of the court has been used properly, the good faith of the parties, public policy and the interests of justice to prevent improper use of its machinery and the judicial process as a means of vexation and oppression (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat </span>at [18]). For instance, if a claimant knowingly pursues a case that is “doomed to fail”, the claimant would be wasting the court’s time and this would amount to an abuse of process as the proceedings serve no useful purpose (<span class="font-italic">Leong Quee Ching Karen </span>at [27] citing <span class="font-italic">Kim Hok Yung and others v Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank) (Lee Mon Sun, third party)</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 455 at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), the test is whether it is in the interests of justice to strike out the pleadings. This gives effect to the court’s inherent jurisdiction to prevent injustice, such as where the claim is plainly or obviously unsustainable (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin Rahmat </span>at [19]). This provision is residuary in nature and intended to empower the court to terminate an action or dismiss a defence or make any other appropriate order if this outcome is necessary to achieve the interests of justice. If there are circumstances which do not fall within O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), they may be caught by this ground (<span class="font-italic">Leong Quee Ching Karen </span>at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Having regard to the authorities on the law on striking out, I am of the view that the claimant’s case ought to be struck out as it is plainly or obviously unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The claimant’s claim is time-barred</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I agree with the defendants that the claimant’s claim is time-barred as more than three years have passed since the claimant’s cause of action accrued and he acquired the requisite knowledge to bring an action against the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The starting point for bringing an action founded on tort is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued as stated in s 6(1) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, Rev Ed 1996) (“Limitation Act”).

</div> In view of the claimant’s position, it is strictly not necessary for me to go on to consider whether the three-year limitation ought to run from a later date pursuant to s 24A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Limitation Act. However, since the defendants have made submissions on the point, I proceed to consider this issue for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In this regard, I note that s 24A(4) of the Limitation Act defines the knowledge required to bring an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury or damage as knowledge: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that injury or damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the identity of the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than the defendant, of the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)  of material facts about the injury or damage which would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such injury or damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 24A(6) of the Limitation Act further states that a person’s knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) from facts ascertainable by him with the appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Court of Appeal, in <span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong v Ow Wah Foong and another</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 165 (“<span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong</span>”) at [36]–[38], elaborated on what constitutes knowledge under s 24A(4) of the Limitation Act. For the purposes of s 24A(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), knowledge is to be interpreted in broad terms of the facts on which the plaintiff’s claim is based and of the defendant’s acts or omissions and knowing that there is a real possibility that those acts or omissions have been a cause of the damage. With regard to “attributability”, the claimant need not know the details of what went wrong, and it is wholly irrelevant whether he appreciated that what went wrong amounted in law to negligence, as long as <span class="font-italic">he knows of the factual essence of his complaint</span>. For the purposes of s 24A(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), a claimant is not required to know that he had a possible cause of action and the requirement for the injury or damage to be “sufficiently serious” means that the action considered must not be frivolous or wholly without merit, taking into account the effort required in instituting a court action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As regards the degree of knowledge required, reasonable belief rather than absolute knowledge is enough to start the time running. For instance, knowing with sufficient confidence to embark on the preliminaries to the issue of an originating claim, submitting a claim to the proposed defendant, taking legal and other advice and collecting evidence would constitute reasonable belief. However, mere suspicion, particularly if it is vague and unsupported, will normally not suffice (<span class="font-italic">Lian Kok Hong </span>at [41]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the present case, the evidence reveals that the claimant had the requisite knowledge to bring this Suit by May 2018 at the latest:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 15 March 2016, the claimant requested a specialist medical report from the Department of Neurosurgery of the fourth defendant and the purpose of the request was stated as “legal proceedings”.

</div> Thus, he would have known the factual essence of his complaint in a reasonably short period of time after the Surgery, which could not have been later than May 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As evident from his complaints to the fourth defendant, Ministry of Health, Legal Aid Bureau and MP Lim, the claimant not only knew the factual basis of his various complaints but even proceeded to prepare evidence in support of his claim by seeking the necessary medical reports. From the series of medical reports he requested, the claimant was made aware of the identities of the putative defendants. As explained in the preceding paragraph, the claimant also must have known the material facts about his injury or damage which would lead a reasonable person to consider it sufficiently serious to justify instituting proceedings against the defendants because he claimed to have suffered the Side Effects shortly after 16 June 2015 and Permanent Disability after the Surgery in 2015. Thus, by latest May 2018, he must have had the knowledge required to bring this Suit. Therefore, even if the three-year limitation period began from May 2018, the claimant’s action would still be time-barred as this Suit was commenced on 13 April 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I turn to address two ancillary points raised by the claimant. First, I wholly reject the claimant’s argument that there was a ploy by the defendants to cause the time bar. It suffices to say that this bare assertion is not even supported by a shred of evidence and appears to be a mere afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Second, the claimant asserted in the hearing before me that he suffers from cognitive impairment and is confused. While I note that Dr Lee opined that the claimant’s brain injury may have caused him some degree of permanent cognitive impairment (at [16] above), Dr Lee’s opinion is not clear as to what degree any such impairment would affect the claimant’s ability to have the requisite knowledge to bring this Suit. Further, considering Dr Yeo’s assessment that the claimant passed an abbreviated mental test on all counts and his mentation appeared intact (at [22] above) and the claimant’s ability to take the necessary steps to institute this Suit (at [44] above), this assertion does not alter my conclusion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the premises, I agree with the defendants that the claimant’s claim ought to be struck out since it is time-barred. The pre-existing position under the ROC 2014 was that the court would strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim if the limitation period expired on the basis that the claim was “frivolous or vexatious” or an “abuse of process” (Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice </span>(LexisNexis, 2023) at paras [9.16.5] citing <span class="font-italic">People’s Parkway Development v Akitek Tenggara </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 469; <span class="font-italic">Yan Jun v Attorney-General </span>[2014] 1 SLR 793 and <span class="font-italic">Liew Soon Fook Michael and Anor v Yi Kai Development Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHC 88 at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In my view, the same approach applies to ROC 2021. A claim which is time-barred is clearly unsustainable and would be an abuse of process if allowed to continue. Considering the Ideals of expeditious proceedings and efficient use of court resources stated in O 3 r 1 of the ROC 2021, it would also be in the interests of justice to strike out such a claim. I therefore strike out the claimant’s statement of claim and dismiss this Suit under O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and O 9 r 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The claimant’s claim is plainly and obviously unsustainable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Even if I am wrong on striking out the claimant’s statement of claim and dismissing this Suit on the basis that the claimant’s claim has been time-barred, I would strike out the claimant’s claim in any case on the basis that it is plainly and obviously unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52  It is most telling that the claimant’s expert report by Dr Yeo submitted pursuant to paragraph 4 of the Medical Negligence Protocol contradicts all of his allegations. Despite being told of the claimant’s various complaints against the defendants (see [22]–[22] above), Dr Yeo opines that “the various treatments given to him have been <span class="font-italic">appropriate</span>” [emphasis added] (see [24(e)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my judgment, I find the claimant’s case to be bereft of any foundation and roundly contradicted by all the objective evidence on record. I turn to briefly address each of his complaints against the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 First, in relation to his complaint that the first, second and fourth defendants had negligently diagnosed him with T2DM when he did not have such a condition, this complaint is contradicted by his test results. In Dr Yeo’s report, he observed that the claimant likely had T2DM at least a year before 2010. Laboratory investigations confirmed that the claimant had grossly elevated HbA1c levels (with the results at 8.7% in 2010, 24.0% in 2015 and 7.1% in 2020) and blood sugar of 16.5 mmol/L in 2015. Dr Yeo stated that these results were consistent with the World Health Organization’s criteria for a diagnosis of T2DM (see [24(b)] above). I note that these results are also consistent with a diagnosis of T2DM since a laboratory investigation form ordered on 22 December 2020 by Marine Parade Polyclinic states that the HbA1c target for most non-pregnant adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes should be &lt;7.0% or &lt;53 mmol/mol.

</div> Further, the claimant’s assertion that the first defendant failed to ensure that he had fasted before doing a blood glucose test also does not suffice to support any alleged negligence given the consistency of the test results repeatedly confirming his diagnosis of T2DM.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> During the hearing before me, the claimant initially said that he met the second defendant but eventually clarified that he did not remember the name of the doctor who had treated him. He named the second defendant in this Suit because of her signature on the medical report dated 5 December 2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As recounted above at [9] above, the fourth defendant did prescribe metformin to the claimant on 12 October 2015. During this visit at the Department of Endocrinology, the claimant was educated on his diagnosis and given an appointment with a diabetes nurse educator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Even if the claimant’s pleadings that the defendants had prescribed metformin to the claimant which caused the claimant to suffer the Side Effects are assumed true, this does not establish that the defendants’ prescription of metformin to the claimant for treatment of T2DM is negligent. To establish a claim in negligence, the claimant must establish a duty of care, breach of the duty of care, and damage caused. As to whether a doctor has breached his duty of care to a patient, the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee</span> [1957] 1 WLR 582 and <span class="font-italic">Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority</span> [1998] AC 232 (cumulatively, the “<span class="font-italic">Bolam-Bolitho</span> Test”) apply. The <span class="font-italic">Bolam-Bolitho Test </span>requires that the defendant’s practice is supported by a responsible body of opinion within the profession, even if there is another body of opinion which disagrees and that the experts holding the opinion had directed their minds to the comparative risks and benefits relating to the matter and the opinion is defensible (<span class="font-italic">Hii Chii Kok v Ooi Peng Jin London Lucien and another </span>[2017] 2 SLR 492 at [76(c)] and [76(d)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The claimant’s pleadings, however, are premised on the misguided allegation that his T2DM diagnosis is wrong and that the defendants are negligent simply because he suffered Side Effects after consuming metformin. I find this claim plainly and obviously unsustainable as well. Given my finding above (at [54]) that his T2DM diagnosis is supported by laboratory investigations, the allegation that the prescription of metformin is negligent on the basis that his T2DM diagnosis is wrong is a non-starter. Even if the claimant suffered Side Effects from taking metformin as prescribed, this does not in itself amount to medical negligence on the part of the defendants. There are no facts pleaded to even show some chance of success of establishing a breach of the standard of care on the part of the defendants in accordance with the <span class="font-italic">Bolam-Bolitho </span>Test. For instance, it is not pleaded that the defendants had any special knowledge of any allergy that the claimant had which was not taken into account in the decision to prescribe metformin. Instead, Dr Yeo’s evidence for the claimant is that the treatment with oral diabetic agents such as metformin and glipizide was correct (see [24(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Third, in relation to his complaint that the third and fourth defendants negligently conducted the Surgery without his consent, this complaint is patently baseless. It was explained in a medical report dated 26 July 2017 by the third defendant that the Surgery was needed to save the claimant’s life and prevent permanent brain damage. At that time, the claimant was comatose and incompetent to give consent. The medical team at the fourth defendant therefore performed the Surgery “in the best interests of the patient”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Where the patient is incompetent and unable to provide consent for treatment, the law allows doctors the power to proceed with emergency treatment of the patient in the patient’s best interests. The High Court, in <span class="font-italic">Re LP (adult patient: medical </span><span class="font-italic">treatment) </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 13 at [9]–[10], explained that in situations where doctors are unable to obtain clear and express consent of their patient to proceed with any medical treatment, their only course is to act in the best interests of the patient. More recently, the High Court, in <span class="font-italic">Goh Guan Sin (by her litigation representative Chiam Yu Zhu) v Yeo Tseng Tsai and another </span>[2021] 3 SLR 364 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Guan Sin</span>”) at [284], observed that in a situation where emergency and immediate treatment was needed to prevent the patient’s death, the legal significance of consent, which could not in any case have been obtained, paled in importance compared to acting in the patient’s best interests which could be assessed to be saving the patient’s life. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 While the fourth defendant’s treatment team sought consent for the Surgery from the claimant’s mother, counsel for the defendants rightly concedes that this does not have the legal effect of providing consent on behalf of the claimant. This is because even the claimant’s mother, as his next of kin, does not have the right to consent on behalf of the claimant. The position, as set out by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Goh Guan Sin </span>at [281]–[282], is that the doctor need only obtain informed consent from the next of kin if there is a representative with the legal authority (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a deputy or a lasting power of attorney) to make decisions with respect to medical treatment for the patient. If not, the next of kin has no legal right either to consent or to refuse consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In this case, the evidence before me shows that the claimant was incompetent to give consent for the Surgery and the decision made by the fourth defendant’s treatment team to proceed with the Surgery was unequivocally in the best interests of the claimant with the aim of saving his life. As stated in a medical report dated 26 July 2017 by the third defendant, the claimant’s GCS score dropped from 15 to 11 on 20 December 2015 and he was observed to be “very drowsy”. An urgent CT scan also revealed interval worsening of the claimant’s left SDH. This necessitated an emergency burr hole drainage procedure.

</div> The claimant does not plead that the Surgery was conducted for any other reason other than his best interests. The facts pleaded also do not allow any basis for the court to conclude that there was negligence. Dr Yeo opined that the treatment given to the claimant was appropriate and the symptoms the claimant complained of were a consequence of “serious head injury and [SDH]” (see above at [24(c)]). Thus, I find that the claimant’s complaint as pleaded is unsustainable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Fourth, in relation to his complaint that the third and fourth defendants treated him negligently after the 2015 Fall, the claimant does not even plead any specifics as to the alleged negligent treatment. Given the insufficient particularisation which surely cannot fairly apprise the defendants of the case they have to meet in their defence (see <span class="font-italic">Chandra Winata Lie v Citibank NA </span>[2015] 1 SLR 875 at [34]), this claim is in my view bound to fail.
