When the court questioned Mr Seah why he/the Plaintiff then waited for another two years before she made her application, he said it was because of the Defendants’ applications including Interrogatories (in June 2017) which the Plaintiff could only answer in October 2017. He added that in between (items no. 11 to 16 in [22] above), the Plaintiff was seeing many doctors because her original whiplash injury developed into something serious.

When he received the report that the Plaintiff’s PTSD was due to the first accident and he sent it to the Defendants, the Defendants requested that the Plaintiff be examined by their insurers’ psychiatrist. Mr Seah said that he thought it would be prudent for all medical reports to be available and hence took some time to file the OS application after he decided that the Plaintiff’s action exceeded the jurisdiction of the District Courts.

Neither did they state what would be the fate of the second claim (consolidated with the DC Suit) as the Plaintiff had not applied to transfer the second claim to the High Court. Indeed, the second claim did not feature at all in Mr Seah’s submissions or in his list at [22] above, notwithstanding the consolidation order granted on 11 December 2017 at [17] above.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defendants’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In his submissions, counsel for the Defendants, Mr Pang, relied on the Plaintiff’s two AEICs as well as the documents exhibited in her AEICs and/or the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit and her list of documents (particularly her medical reports). He pointed out that the Plaintiff’s transfer application was filed more than nine years after the first accident; more than 8 years after she instituted the first claim; more than seven years after the second accident took place; and more than seven years after interlocutory judgment was obtained in the first claim. It was also more than five years after the first claim was converted to the DC Suit and more than five years after the Plaintiff commenced the second claim. It was also more than two years after the Plaintiff filed her first AEIC; more than a year after she filed her second AEIC; and more than three months after the first tranche of the assessment hearing on 17 May 2019. The assessment hearing was supposed to resume on 18 October 2019.

For her neck injuries, the Plaintiff apparently suffered from paresthesia in her fingers, toes and the whole of her two arms some four years after the first accident.  Her back injuries were L4 and L5 disc bulk and a L5/S1 disc protrusion. In 2010, her prognosis for recovery was excellent while her orthopaedic injuries were also pre-existing. The Defendants estimated damages for the Plaintiff’s orthopaedic injuries to be $10,000 and $8,000 for back and neck respectively for a total of $18,000.

The PTSD recurred after the second accident but she improved significantly by 2012.

In <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span><span class="font-italic"> II </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the plaintiff/respondent was involved in an accident on 13 November 2001 while working at the premises of the defendant/appellant. He subsequently commenced proceedings in the district court for his claim for personal injury and losses. Although the plaintiff’s claim ($725,000) exceeded the jurisdiction of the district courts, no steps were taken to transfer the matter to the High Court. Instead, the parties entered into a consent interlocutory judgment on 7 May 2004 based on apportionment of liability with damages to be assessed. The plaintiff changed solicitors on 25 May 2006. His new solicitors recognised that his claim exceeded the district courts’ jurisdiction. However, because of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ricky </span><span class="font-italic">Charles s/o Gabriel Thanabalan v Chua Boon Yeow</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 511 (“<span class="font-italic">Ricky Charles</span>”), they did not apply to transfer the plaintiff’s action to the High Court (in a nutshell, <span class="font-italic">Rick</span><span class="font-italic">y Charles</span> held that where a plaintiff had obtained interlocutory judgment in the district courts, he had thereby affirmed the district courts’ jurisdiction and would not be allowed to transfer his action to the High Court).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On 5 April 2007, the defendant in that case brought an application before the district court pursuant to O 14 r 12 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322 R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) to determine whether the deduction for contributory negligence was to be made from the district court limit or from the actual damages assessed. The issue was eventually resolved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span> <span class="font-italic">Dockyard </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 839 (“<span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine I</span><span class="font-italic">”)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As a result of certain observations made by the Court of Appeal in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine I</span> on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Rick</span><span class="font-italic">y Charles</span>, the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span> <span class="font-italic">II</span> ([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) then applied on 24 April 2008 to transfer his action to the High Court. The High Court judge allowed the transfer (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Chan Teng v Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 647). On appeal by the defendant, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine II </span>allowed the appeal and reversed the decision of the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In disallowing the plaintiff’s transfer of his action to the High Court, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine II</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) held (at [17]–[20]), <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he mere existence or presence of a “sufficient reason” [under s 54B of the SCA] does not automatically entitle a party to have the proceedings transferred from the District Court to the High Court. A holistic evaluation of all the material circumstances needs to be undertaken in every case where a transfer application is made; in particular, the court needs to assess the prejudice that might be visited upon the party resisting such a transfer …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he “prejudice” suffered by the appellant was not simply that the damages awarded could exceed the District Court’s jurisdictional limit … First, at the time the parties entered the consent interlocutory judgment, it was thought that, following <span class="font-italic">Rick</span><span class="font-italic">y Charles</span>, by entering the interlocutory judgment in the District Court, the parties would be taken to have affirmed the jurisdiction of the District Court and would, therefore, be barred from transferring proceedings to the High Court … [I]t was rather unlikely that the appellant would have agreed to a consent order on the same terms had they known of this potential exposure. To allow for the transfer of proceedings now would, therefore, prejudicially expose the appellant to increased damages … Second, … both parties had accepted and relied on the consensual agreement for a substantial period of time … Third, even if we were to exercise our discretion to transfer the proceedings on the condition that the consent order was to be set aside, the appellant would nevertheless still be prejudiced by the transfer. Certain interlocutory processes have already been completed since the interlocutory judgment was entered … The appellant quite rightly underscored the fact that many practical difficulties might arise if the issue of liability had also to be re-opened … [T]o require the appellant to defend its case on liability despite the significant lapse of time since the accident occurred would be severely prejudicial to its interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Subsequently, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ng Djoni</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) followed and applied the principles enunciated in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span><span class="font-italic"> II </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Djoni</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the plaintiff and the defendant were involved in a car accident on 27 December 2012. On 23 December 2015, the plaintiff commenced an MC Suit (“the MC Suit”) against the defendant for the injuries he sustained in the 2012 accident. In 2016, the plaintiff was involved in two more car accidents. The writ of summons and statement of claim were finally served on the defendant on 16 March 2017 after the writ of summons was twice renewed. On 11 April 2017, the plaintiff applied to transfer the MC Suit to the High Court on the ground that his claim for damages would exceed the State Courts’ jurisdiction of $250,000. An Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) disallowed the application for the reason that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that his claim would exceed the jurisdiction of the State Courts and that there would be irreparable prejudice to the defendant if the transfer were allowed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The plaintiff appealed to a judge in chambers by way of a Registrar’s Appeal. His appeal was dismissed as the judge accepted the AR’s reasoning and held that there was a two stage process to the court’s analysis of whether there is “any other sufficient reason” for a transfer to the High Court under s 54B of the SCA and adopted the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span> <span class="font-italic">II </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) set out at [52] above. The judge added that there must be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> credible evidence (which there was none) to substantiate the assertions underlying the quantification of the claims. She further held that there would be irreparable prejudice to the defendant if the MC Suit were to be transferred to the High Court, as the plaintiff had delayed in commencing his suit and in crystallising his position on the quantum of damages claimed. As a result of the delay, any re-examination of the plaintiff’s medical condition, which the defendant wished to carry out if his potential liability became higher, would not be fruitful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I turn next to the case of <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat </span>([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that the Plaintiff relied on. There, the plaintiff commenced a DC Suit in 2009 to recover damages for injuries he sustained when his taxi was involved in a collision with a vehicle driven by the defendant on 14 October 2008. The plaintiff obtained consent interlocutory judgment against the defendant on 17 March 2010 on the basis the defendant would bear 85% liability. On 17 May 2012, the plaintiff applied to transfer the DC Suit to the High Court. By then, two assessment hearings in the State Courts had been adjourned twice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the plaintiff, a taxi-driver, was able to show a material change in his condition, as shown in his medical reports, since the time he filed his writ in the State Courts. The breakdown of his claim for general damages produced to the court showed a total sum of $463,500. The plaintiff had been on medical leave since the accident and had not been able to return to work. As a consequence of the whiplash injury he suffered from the accident (together with a right foot fracture), the plaintiff alleged he was troubled by chronic neck and lower back pain and he suffered from depression as well as impotency, both of which the defendant contended were unsubstantiated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The plaintiff had relied on the medical reports of one Dr Ho for the change in his condition. However, the defendant had roundly criticised Dr Ho’s medical reports on the basis that Dr Ho, being a consultant anaesthesiologist and not an orthopaedic surgeon, was not qualified to comment on the orthopaedic condition of the plaintiff or to assess his medical condition. The defendant’s orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Chang, on the other hand, had concluded that the plaintiff’s neck pain had been resolved while his back issues were age-related degeneration. Dr Chang further opined that surgical procedures recommended by Dr Ho were unnecessary and the plaintiff could be gainfully re-employed, including driving a taxi.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Although the court there agreed that the time lapse (between the accident and the transfer application) was not ideal, it noted that there was no evidence that the time lapse had led to any particular difficulty in conducting the litigation. Consequently, the court held that the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> established the material change in circumstances necessary to support his application for a transfer. Consequently, notwithstanding the objections of the defendant, the court granted the transfer application on the basis that the consent judgment was set aside so that, after the transfer, the defendant could defend the suit and argue that his liability should be for less than 85% of the plaintiff’s damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the present facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As can be seen from the narrative in [56] to [59], the facts of <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span> ([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) were far removed from those in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It bears noting that the application to transfer proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span> <span class="font-italic">II </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) was made almost four years after the consent interlocutory judgment. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Djoni</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), it was four years and four months after the plaintiff commenced proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the delay between the granting of the consent judgment and the transfer application was just two years and two months. The time lapses in the three cases should be contrasted with the prolonged delays in this case as set out earlier at [34] above. Here, the plaintiff was making her transfer application in August 2019, which was more than <span class="font-italic">seven</span> years after she obtained consent judgment (on 4 July 2012) for her first claim and more than <span class="font-italic">nine</span> years after the first accident (on 26 May 2010). No valid excuse or any explanation was offered in the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit for such delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 At the hearing below, the learned AR had considered the medical report of Raffles Hospital dated 20 November 2016 exhibited in the plaintiff’s second AEIC dated 6 June 2018. The plaintiff had quantified her claim for general damages at $800,000 at the hearing below. This is what the learned AR said in dismissing the plaintiff’s transfer application:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The evidence provided by the Plaintiff does not appear to support the desired quantification $800,000. First, no breakdown has been given as to how the amount of $800,000 is reached. Next, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> inspection of the IRAS statements, there did not appear to be any drop in the Plaintiff’s income in the immediate years following the accident. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Further, I find that even if there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the claim amount exceeds $250,000, I find that there would be substantial injustice caused to the Defendant if the issue of liability is reopened when the matter is transferred. It has been more than 9 years since the accident. As far as the further medical reports are concerned, it would have been apparent to the Plaintiff by, at the very latest November 2016, that the Plaintiff had a medical report stating that the 1st incident may still be operative to cause her injuries. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit paragraph 6, the medical reports referred to are up to 2016. It would have been apparent by then what the extent of the Plaintiff’s injuries were and the quantum that the Plaintiff seeks to claim. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having considered <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span>, there are practical difficulties if the issue of apportionment of liability is reopened. There would be prejudice suffered by the Defendant in preparing its case against the third party (and vice versa) in the apportionment. That is not compensable costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 This court endorses the learned AR’s above comments. Before the learned AR, the plaintiff’s counsel stated that the medical report the learned AR referred to came from the defendants. That would have been the report of Dr Lim Yun Chin, a consultant in Psychological Medicine at Raffles Hospital (referred to above by the learned AR) stating that the plaintiff had not fully recovered from PTSD resulting from the first accident when she met with the second accident 16 months later. However, there was also another medical report along the same lines as that from Raffles Hospital. That was the plaintiff’s own medical report that she referred to in her first AEIC dated 17 April 2017 (see [23] above), namely that dated 30 June 2016 from Dr Raja Sathy Velloo of IMH. In that report,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Pang’s Affidavit at p 187. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Dr Velloo clarified his earlier report dated 3 March 2016 and said: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Based on our record, the first accident caused her initial Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTAD). The diagnosis of PTSD was made by a private psychiatrist. She reported that she improved with treatment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The second accident caused a relapse of her PTSD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Based on her own medical report from IMH, therefore, the plaintiff well-knew almost five months before 20 November 2016 that her PTSD resulted from the first accident and recurred after the second accident. No further medical reports were required after 20 November 2016 – her condition may improve but would not worsen so as to prevent the Plaintiff from pursuing her two claims whether in the High Court or in the State Courts. However, the Plaintiff did nothing. This can be seen from her solicitor’s own selective chronology of events set out in [22] above. Instead, what she did in June 2017 was to refuse to answer the Interrogatories served on her by the Defendants and to continue to ignore them despite an order of court directing her to furnish her answers in August 2017, until she was served with an “unless order” in October 2017 (see [15] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Earlier (at [33] above), I had alluded to the Plaintiff’s failure to address the court on what would happen to the second claim and the consolidation order if the transfer application was allowed. The second claim will be left in limbo if only the DC Suit is transferred to the High Court. In addition, the Plaintiff seemed to have overlooked that there are third party proceedings in the DC Suit. What about the position of the Third Party? Would he be forced to defend a High Court suit for his 5% liability to the Plaintiff? The Plaintiff did not even join the Third Party to the OS until prompted by the Court below to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 No figures were provided by the Plaintiff that showed that her claim for general damages was likely to exceed the $250,000 threshold of the State Courts’ jurisdiction. The Plaintiff had sought to persuade this court to follow <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), where the court held that a transfer application is not the forum to determine the merits of the Plaintiff’s claim or its quantum. That may be so but the burden is still on the Plaintiff to present some <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence (as the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>did), that the general damages she is claiming is likely to exceed $250,000; she failed to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Defendants, on the other hand, presented figures that showed that the Plaintiff’s claim for damages <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> is unlikely to be anywhere near $250,000 (see [38]–[46] above). To recapitulate, the Defendants’ main arguments, in regard to the Plaintiff’s physical (whiplash) injuries, is that she had recovered well and her future medical expenses may be $10,000 to $18,000 (according to the Defendants; see [39] above). Giving the Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, the court would be prepared to double those figures to say $38,000 to $40,000. It was difficult to estimate the Plaintiff’s loss of future earnings as her income tax returns at [41] above showed no discernible loss of income after the first accident. Again, giving the Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and awarding her some loss of future earnings, it could never be anywhere near $50,000 or $100,000. Similarly, her claim for pain and suffering cannot be a high figure. The Plaintiff would not be able to claim for any surgical procedures in future as none of her medical reports made the recommendation. Consequently, the court is hard put to make an estimate, however generous, of $250,000 and more, for her claim for general damages. Her claims for special damages cannot be excessive either in the light of [46] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Apart from the lack of substantiation that the Plaintiff’s claim is likely to exceed $250,000, there is the question of prejudice as pointed out by the learned AR at [62] above. It would be appropriate for the court to refer to <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine </span><span class="font-italic">II </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at this juncture and to cite the following passage from the appellate court’s judgment (at [52] above):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A holistic evaluation of all the material circumstances needs to be undertaken in every case where a transfer application is made; in particular, the court needs to assess the prejudice that might be visited upon the party resisting such a transfer...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Irreparable prejudice would be caused not only to the Defendants but also to the Third Party if the transfer application is allowed. For seven years, the Defendants were under the impression that their total liability would not exceed $250,000 with the Third Party bearing 5% of the quantum determined by the court. The Defendants may not even have consented to interlocutory judgment in July 2012 had they known that their liability for damages was not capped at $250,000. No amount of costs that the Plaintiff is willing to pay can compensate for the prejudice the Defendants would suffer thereby. Not only must the consent judgment be set aside for the DC Suit if the first claim is transferred to the High Court, but also what about the Third Party proceedings, the consolidation order, the second claim and the adjourned hearing for the assessment of damages in the State Courts? To echo the words of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span><span class="font-italic"> II </span>([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>; see [52] above):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Certain interlocutory processes have already been completed since the interlocutory judgment was entered … The appellant quite rightly underscored the fact that many practical difficulties might arise if the issue of liability had also to be re-opened … [T]o require the appellant to defend its case on liability despite the significant lapse of time since the accident occurred would be severely prejudicial to its interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It also bears noting that the Plaintiff should have been the party that applied for consolidation of the two claims instead of relying on the Defendants to do so. She was never proactive in the pursuit of either of her two claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the many reasons set out earlier, this court was of the view that the transfer application should not be granted and it was accordingly dismissed with costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu<br/>Senior Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Seah Choon Huat Johnny (Seah &amp; Co) for the plaintiff/appellant; <br/>Pang Weng Fong and Anthony Wee (United Legal Alliance LLC) for the first and second defendants/respondents and the third party.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
