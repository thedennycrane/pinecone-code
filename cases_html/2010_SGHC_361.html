<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff was a former group regional
                    director of the defendant. Between March 2005 and December 2009, he was employed
                    in various senior executive and managerial positions in the Asia-Pacific region.
                    During his employment, he signed a Confidentiality, Restrictions &amp;
                    Intellectual Property Agreement (“the non-compete agreement”) with
                    the defendant. On 11 September 2009, the plaintiff gave three
                    months’ notice of his resignation. His last day of employment would
                    therefore have been 10 December 2009. However, on 9 December 2009, the
                    defendant purported to dismiss him summarily with immediate
                effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant was incorporated in Singapore in
                    October 2003. It is in the business of designing and developing location-based
                    information technology services and solutions (telematics). These solutions
                    enable businesses and government organizations to monitor, trace and control the
                    movement and status of machinery, vehicles, personnel and other assets. The
                    defendant’s business dealings are often confidential as they pertain to
                    matters of security and defence. It is part of the Astrata Group of companies
                    which comprises Astrata (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“ASP”) and Astrata
                    Group Inc (“AGI”), a USA company. AGI is the parent company of the
                    defendant which is in turn the parent company of ASP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff commenced an action for the salary
                    due to him from September to 10 December 2009 and for payment of expenses
                    and accrued leave. The defendant filed its defence and counterclaim alleging
                    that the plaintiff had breached his duties by giving information to certain
                    entities (“the US parties”) resulting in the defendant having to
                    incur extra costs to defend a Chapter 11 proceeding in the USA. Just before
                    the defendant applied for an interim injunction and a search order against the
                    plaintiff, it sought leave to amend its defence and counterclaim to include a
                    new claim for breach of the non-compete agreement. Its application was allowed
                    save for the prayer asking for leave to use the evidence obtained in this action
                    in any other proceedings between the Tridex Companies and the defendant’s
                    group of companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 21 June 2010, the defendant applied for
                    and obtained an interim injunction and search orders against the plaintiff.
                    These orders were extracted as order no. 2968 of 2010 (“the
                    injunction”), order no. 2969 of 2010 and order no. 2986 of 2010
                    (“the search orders”). Among other things, the defendant alleged
                    that the plaintiff had approached its customers and business partners (namely
                    COSEM, the Tridex Companies and TNT). The injunction enjoined the plaintiff from
                    giving confidential information to third parties and from breaching the
                    non-compete agreement. The search orders were directed at evidence that the
                    plaintiff had given information to the US parties as well as his breach of the
                    non-compete agreement. The search orders were extended by the court on
                    25 June 2010, extracted as order no. 3082 of 2010, as the physical
                    imaging of the plaintiff’s gmail account could not be completed in time. A
                    moratorium of two weeks was ordered against perusal of any materials obtained as
                    a result of these orders and if the plaintiff should apply within two weeks to
                    set aside or to vary the orders, the prohibition against perusal would continue
                    until further notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There were two applications in issue here. In
                    summons no. 3229 of 2010, the plaintiff sought to set aside the orders
                    mentioned above, the return of certain items, the prohibition against usage of
                    those items in any legal or arbitral proceedings against the plaintiff or other
                    entities, the non-disclosure of the items’ contents, an inquiry as to
                    damages and costs. In summons no. 3351 of 2010, the defendant applied for a
                    copy of an email sent from one James Lau to the plaintiff on 19 April 2010
                    (“the James Lau email”) to be made available to the defendant or
                    its solicitors, that the moratorium be lifted in respect of that email and that
                    the defendant be permitted to use it in this action and for costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After hearing the parties, I varied order
                    no. 2969 of 2010 by setting aside that part of paragraph 2 that
                    allowed the defendant to use the information and documents disclosed or produced
                    pursuant to the search orders for purposes of any claim against the plaintiff as
                    well as the Tridex Companies in and outside Singapore (“the arguments on
                    the <em>Riddick</em> principle”). All other orders
                    granted were ordered to stand. I also lifted the moratorium against perusal and
                    ordered costs at 90% to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, the deduction
                    of 10% being the costs attributed to the arguments on the <em>Riddick</em> principle. No stay was granted in respect of these
                    orders. I directed the parties’ solicitors to review the disputed
                    documents obtained and try to come to an agreement whether they fall within the
                    ambit of the search orders, failing which the plaintiff may apply to court to
                    resolve the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff has appealed to the Court of
                    Appeal against these orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the course of the plaintiff’s
                    employment, he signed, in 2007, the non-compete agreement which contained the
                    following pertinent terms:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The “Termination Date” referred to
                    would be 9 December 2009 according to the defendant and 10 December
                    2009 according to the plaintiff. “Products or Services” was
                    defined as referring to products or services of the same kind or materially
                    similar kind or competitive with any products or services sold or supplied by
                    the defendant or any Relevant Group Company. “Relevant Customer”
                    referred to any person or organization who/which during the Relevant Period is
                    or was negotiating with the defendant and a Relevant Group Company for the sale
                    or supply of Relevant Products or Services or a client or customer of the
                    defendant or any Relevant Group Company for the sale and supply of Relevant
                    Products or Services or in the habit of dealing with the defendant or any
                    Relevant Group Company for the sale or supply of Relevant Products or Services
                    and in each case with whom or which the plaintiff was directly concerned or
                    connected or of whom or which the defendant had personal knowledge during the
                    Relevant Period in the course of his employment. In this case, the Relevant
                    Customers included the Tridex Companies, COSEM and TNT. “Relevant Group
                    Company” referred to any Group Company for which the plaintiff had
                    performed services under his agreement or for which he had operational or
                    management responsibility at any time during the “Relevant
                    Period”, which in turn referred to the period of 12 months immediately
                    before the Termination Date. “Relevant Products or Services” were
                    the sale or supply of products or services with which the plaintiff was directly
                    concerned or connected with or of which he had personal knowledge during the
                    Relevant Period in the course of his employment with the defendant. As the
                    plaintiff was the managing director of the defendant and a director of its
                    subsidiary, he had personal knowledge of all the products and services provided
                    by the defendant and its subsidiary. “Restricted Territory” would
                    be any place in the world where the defendant or any Relevant Group Company had
                    carried on business during the Relevant Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff admitted that he met James Tan
                    of COSEM, a Relevant Customer, business partner and potential competitor of the
                    defendant. He also approached another customer, the Tridex Companies, for
                    business leads. The plaintiff had been photographed meeting James Tan and James
                    Lau (a Tridex employee). He acknowledged that he contacted Tony Lugg, the
                    security manager of TNT, sometime in May 2010. COSEM, the Tridex Companies and
                    TNT were major customers of the defendant during the plaintiff’s
                    employment. The nature of the defendant’s business was that at any one
                    point of time, it would be mainly involved in a few select projects with a few
                    major customers. It was not a business with multiple customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     COSEM’s website indicated that it dealt
                    with vehicle tracking and fleet management systems and could design solutions to
                    enable businesses to efficiently allocate and track the movement and location of
                    their vehicles anywhere. Its services therefore compete directly with those
                    provided by the defendant. COSEM also works on projects in collaboration with
                    the defendant. It still wishes to bid with the defendant for a project for speed
                    monitoring and control of heavy vehicles in Singapore. It is therefore also a
                    Relevant Customer or business partner. The plaintiff admitted that James Tan of
                    COSEM had asked him to look at a draft quotation for supply of an automatic
                    truck tracking system and give his views. The plaintiff did so and informed
                    James Tan that he thought the quotation was reasonable. By doing so, the
                    plaintiff breached clause 3.2.1 of the non-compete agreement although it
                    was unclear whether the quotation was to or by COSEM. Further, as the defendant
                    was able to provide the same or a similar tracking system to COSEM, the
                    plaintiff was also in breach of clause 3.2.3 as he would cause COSEM to
                    cease or to reduce its order from the defendant. The plaintiff’s conduct
                    and the surrounding circumstances provided a strong <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of breach of his obligations to the defendant which
                    the plaintiff was not able to rebut by his bare assertions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff stated that he was working on
                    and providing an Asterisk Fingerprint Access Control System to COSEM with Lau
                    Hui Jen, also a former employee of the defendant. They incorporated a company
                    called SGT Pte Ltd on 7 June 2010. The plaintiff denied competing with the
                    defendant. He claimed that the said biometric access system was not in
                    competition with the defendant and sought to support his claim by producing a
                    one-page brochure (as an exhibit in Lau Hui Jen’s affidavit). He also
                    averred that he was entitled to meet the defendant’s
                customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The defendant disagreed that its business was
                    only in vehicle tracking and in geomatics in the oil and gas industry. Its core
                    technology is sufficiently versatile to be adapted to perform a number of
                    different functions such as biometric access control if its customers wanted to
                    have that. Accordingly, the defendant argued, even if the plaintiff and Lau Hui
                    Jen were not using the defendant’s proprietary technology, they were
                    engaging in the sale or supply of products and services of the same or
                    materially similar kind or competitive with the defendant’s products and
                    services. By dealing with COSEM and/or possibly Tridex on the biometric access
                    control system, the plaintiff breached clause 3.2.5 of the non-compete
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff admitted that he met James Tan
                    of COSEM for lunch on numerous occasions to discuss various subjects. Lau Hui
                    Jen has effectively admitted that he and the plaintiff have solicited and
                    conducted business with COSEM. The plaintiff was therefore in breach of
                    clause 3.2.4 of the non-compete agreement. Similarly, the plaintiff has
                    admitted trying to get business or business leads from the Tridex Companies
                    although he claimed that it was not in any areas that the Astrata Group was
                    involved in. Tridex was a major customer of ASP during the time of the
                    plaintiff’s employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Although the plaintiff asserted that he did
                    not know whether Lau Ming Chiew (mentioned in the search orders) was James Lau,
                    he accepted that James Lau, an employee of Tridex Technologies Pte Ltd, had
                    picked him up from his home before. The plaintiff had also evaded overtures by
                    the defendant to show him photographs of Lau Ming Chiew to see whether that was
                    the James Lau that he knew. The James Lau email was found in the
                    plaintiff’s home. Its heading was “Greetings from
                    Territory”. As shown by the defendant, “Territory” was the
                    code name for the supply of the defendant’s products and services to the
                    Tridex Companies. Pending perusal of that email, the defendant submitted that it
                    was likely to be an update from James Lau regarding the project between the
                    defendant and Tridex. The plaintiff has made known to the supervising solicitor
                    his objection to release the said email to the defendant or its solicitors
                    unless there is an order of court directing or permitting such release on the
                    basis that he was not sure whether James Lau was Lau Ming Chiew and therefore
                    whether the James Lau email fell within the scope of the search
                orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The defendant contended that it has
                    established a strong <em>prima facie</em> case of breach by
                    the plaintiff of the non-solicit obligations contained in clause 3.2.4 of
                    the non-compete agreement in the light of the plaintiff’s admission that
                    he had met up with Tridex employees on numerous occasions to try to obtain
                    business from the Tridex Companies and his evasive attitude regarding the James
                    Lau email. There was also a strong possibility that he had breached
                    clauses 3.2.1, 3.2.5 and 4.3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Where TNT was concerned, there was no dispute
                    that it was the defendant’s customer. The plaintiff acknowledged that he
                    did try to keep in touch with Tony Lugg of TNT, someone he believed to be
                    well-connected and highly respected in the security industry. The plaintiff
                    emailed Tony Lugg in March 2010 and sent him messages via SMS in May and in June
                    2010 requesting a meeting. While the plaintiff denied that he was trying to
                    solicit TNT for any business relating to the sale or supply of telematics
                    products and services, he did not explain what business he was keen to do with
                    TNT which is involved in logistics and transportation of cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff asserted that he is a consultant
                    in the employ of Hathaway Marine Pte Ltd from 11 January 2010 but did not
                    elaborate on the nature of his work besides stating that this company had
                    nothing to do with telematics. This company is supposedly in the business of
                    logistics support for transportation of materials, transhipment and
                    time-chartering services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     During his employment with the defendant, the
                    plaintiff provided confidential information to persons hostile to the defendant.
                    After his employment ceased, he communicated with the defendant’s
                    customers and business partners, in particular COSEM which was also interested
                    in the speed-limiting technology that the defendant was working on with the
                    Singapore Police Force. Even if the plaintiff was not the lead negotiator for
                    the contracts in question, he was the main contact point with the clients’
                    top management and oversaw the daily progress of the defendant’s projects.
                    The know-how involved in the implementation of the projects was confidential.
                    There was therefore every possibility that the plaintiff had breached his duty
                    of confidentiality in his interaction with COSEM. Further, by setting up SGT Pte
                    Ltd with another ex-employee of the defendant to provide a product which
                    appeared suspiciously similar to the operating rationale of the
                    defendant’s core technology, there was a strong <em>prima
                        facie</em> case that the plaintiff had made use of the
                    defendant’s confidential information as spelt out in the
                    injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff has admitted that he still
                    communicated with some of the companies named in the search orders after the
                    termination of his employment with the defendant and that such email would be in
                    his gmail account. He has also admitted deleting information from the MacBook
                    provided by the defendant to him while he was serving out his notice of
                    resignation after having delayed the return of the same and despite having given
                    an assurance through his solicitors on 11 November 2009 that he would
                    return the notebook at the end of the said notice without tampering with it.
                    This assurance was given after the defendant asked for its return by
                    3 November 2009 (after he had given his notice of resignation) and
                    emphasized in a subsequent letter of 11 November 2009 that it was to be
                    returned by 13 November 2009 without any deletion or alteration of any
                    programmes, files or email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The information technology experts engaged by
                    the defendant to look into the said MacBook found that there was erasure of
                    information between 13 November 2009 and 10 December 2009 (the date it
                    was finally returned to the defendant). Each successful erasure (there were nine
                    of them), which involved a process of writing over the free space in the
                    computer 35 times, took 12 hours or more to complete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff claimed that the deleted
                    information was of a personal nature and that he did not tamper with the
                    computer. He asserted that the computer had a standard built-in function which
                    emptied the trash bin and that it was his practice all along to clean up the
                    trash bin from time to time. He had used the computer for preparing and
                    reviewing documents relating to his dispute with the defendant and for
                    communicating with his lawyers. He was afraid that the defendant’s
                    “very tech-savvy” Anthony Harrison would be able to read the
                    deleted information. Shortly before he returned the computer to the defendant,
                    he activated the function one more time. The plaintiff also accused the
                    defendant of having manipulated the electronic data in the computer and then
                    concealing such manipulation. Four of the defendant’s employees had
                    accessed the computer and had run various data recovery programmes on it before
                    it was handed over to the defendant’s experts. However, while the
                    plaintiff’s information technology experts opined that manipulation was
                    possible, they accepted that it was a technically difficult thing to do. No
                    evidence was adduced that manipulation did occur.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It was not disputed that the data-deletion
                    function had to be activated by the user who must consciously select how many
                    times he wants to write over the free space. The more times the writing-over
                    takes place, the longer the time needed for the process to complete.
                    Accordingly, the “35 pass” erasure method adopted by the plaintiff
                    would take the longest time to complete. That method also provides the highest
                    degree of guarantee against forensic recovery of data. The programme also
                    informs the user that adopting that method would “prevent the recovery of
                    deleted files”. Back-ups of the data in the computer were in fact done
                    prior to the deletion of data while it was in the plaintiff’s custody.
                    However, the plaintiff denied that he had copies of such back-ups.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The supply agreement between the defendant
                    (through ASP) and the Tridex Companies was worth some US$93million. It was
                    terminated by Tridex on 5 February 2010 and the two parties are now
                    involved in litigation and arbitration. The plaintiff had acquired information
                    about the defendant’s business contacts and technology that would be
                    useful to other competitors in other projects, in particular, the speed-limiting
                    technology which the defendant spent a lot of time developing. The loss that
                    would be caused by him divulging such information was potentially a huge
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was
                    guilty of material non-disclosure when it applied <em>ex
                        parte</em> for the injunction and the search orders. One of the
                    defendant’s assertions on affidavit was that the plaintiff could have been
                    in contact with a competitor of the defendant, a Hong Kong company known as
                    Sunlink Holdings International (“Sunlink”). The plaintiff has now
                    shown conclusively from public records that Sunlink was in liquidation since
                    early 2009. While the defendant has acknowledged its error, it did not explain
                    why no check was done on Sunlink and why it did not discover the truth when it
                    accessed the MacBook in February 2010 to search for evidence of the
                    plaintiff’s contact with Hong Kong companies. Further, the defendant had
                    alleged that Sunlink was now re-established and might be able to
                    reverse-engineer the telematics product that the defendant had designed for
                    Tridex. This suggested that the defendant knew that the Hong Kong company had
                    been in liquidation and was now back in business. The defendant explained that
                    it was under the initial impression that Sunlink had gone into liquidation and
                    was re-established in another form. In any event, it was suspicious that the
                    plaintiff had in his computer a quotation given to a company which was known to
                    be a competitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The defendant was also alleged to have omitted
                    informing the court that the MacBook had been tampered with. It merely stated
                    that three (not four, which was the actual number) of its trusted employees
                    examined the computer and had not deleted anything from it. By omission, the
                    defendant was suggesting that no activity was performed on it. No mention was
                    made of the fact that seven external storage devices were introduced to it and
                    that four files were deleted by the defendant’s employees. Further, the
                    defendant had alleged that all data had been erased when the MacBook was
                    returned on 10 December 2009 although the truth was that more than 14,000 email
                    and more than 8,000 documents still existed therein. The defendant also did not
                    inform the court that the erasure function was a built-in feature. In any case,
                    the plaintiff denied that he used the said erasure function that many times as
                    alleged by the defendant’s experts. The back-up drive that was in the
                    plaintiff’s office during his employment and which was subsequently
                    missing was not kept by the plaintiff. It was not true that only the plaintiff
                    and the human resource manager had the key to the plaintiff’s office. Even
                    the receptionist had such a key. Further, the plaintiff had found his office
                    door open on 21 September 2009, a public holiday, when the defendant was in
                    the midst of moving its office premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff also submitted that the court
                    was entitled to consider whether the terms of the search orders were complied
                    with. If they were not and prejudice was caused, the court could discharge the
                    said orders. The plaintiff complained that the defendant imaged his wife’s
                    laptop and her AOL email account and that the search extended well beyond 5pm on
                    the first three days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The defendant explained that the search
                    concluded at 8.45pm on the first day as the plaintiff had delayed accepting
                    service until 3.08pm although the supervising solicitor was at his premises at
                    12.10pm. The search for the remaining days was halted by the supervising
                    solicitor at around 6 to 7pm with the remaining time taken up in sealing and
                    handing over of the items obtained and in other administrative matters. On the
                    second day, the physical search actually concluded at 4.04pm and the rest of the
                    time was spent imaging the plaintiff’s computers (which was done quietly
                    by the experts in the plaintiff’s study room) and administrative
                    discussions between the parties. The plaintiff’s solicitors were present
                    in the premises at all times and could have raised any objections to the
                    supervising solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The factors to consider when deciding whether
                    or not to grant an injunction are set out in <em>American
                        Cyanamid Co v Ethicon</em> [1975] AC 396 at 407 and 408. The
                    claim must not be frivolous or vexatious, <em>i.e</em>.
                    there is a serious question to be tried. At this stage, the court does not try
                    to resolve conflicts of evidence on affidavit as to facts on which the claims of
                    either party may ultimately depend nor to decide difficult questions of law. The
                    court should then consider whether damages would be an adequate remedy for
                    either party and where the balance of convenience lies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Where restraint of trade clauses are
                    concerned, it is not necessary for the court to assess their reasonableness at
                    this stage. The photographs taken of the plaintiff with the relevant parties and
                    his admission of discussions and looking for business or business leads with
                    those parties indicated that the defendant has real prospects of success in its
                    claim against the plaintiff. By the plaintiff’s actions in approaching the
                    defendant’s customers, for business and/or divulging of confidential
                    information, he could cause great loss in business to the defendant. Such loss
                    would also be hard to quantify. The plaintiff did not appear to be a person with
                    the financial means to be able to meet a judgment for a substantial amount. The
                    defendant, on the other hand, would be able to make good its undertaking as to
                    damages if its case against the plaintiff fails. In any case, the injunction is
                    to prevent the plaintiff from doing what he had already agreed not to do and he
                    has insisted that he was not breaching the non-compete agreement. If that is the
                    case, then the plaintiff has not suffered anything by the grant of the
                    injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Guidance on the circumstances justifying the
                    grant of a search order may be found in the Court of Appeal’s decision in
                        <em>Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest
                        Management Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 907 at [14]. Four tests must
                    be satisfied:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the applicant has shown that it has an
                            extremely strong <em>prima facie</em>
                        case;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the damage suffered by the applicant
                            would have been very serious;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether there is a real possibility that the
                            subject of the search order would destroy relevant documents;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the effect of the search order would be out of
                            proportion to its legitimate object.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In my view, the evidence adduced by the
                    defendant at the <em>ex parte</em> application did show an
                    extremely strong <em>prima facie</em> case of breach of the
                    non-compete agreement by the plaintiff, particularly the non-compete and
                    non-solicit clauses therein. His explanations that the meetings were innocuous
                    were lacking in details. He has acknowledged that they were business meetings
                    and not personal ones. Whether what was discussed was truly not in breach of his
                    obligations to the defendant can only be verified at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff’s conduct surrounding the
                    return of the MacBook left me with a great deal of unease as to whether he would
                    play fair when it comes to discovery of documents. The plaintiff delayed the
                    return of the computer and the forensic evidence pointed to deliberate deletion
                    of information on the device. When his solicitors responded to the
                    defendant’s demands for the return of the MacBook, there was no
                    qualification to the plaintiff’s undertaking not to tamper with it. Yet,
                    soon after the correspondence, the computer’s erasure function was
                    activated many times. The plaintiff’s claim that he deleted only personal
                    and confidential material therefore sounded highly suspicious. His experts
                    alluded to the possibility of manipulation of the data but did not suggest that
                    such did occur. In the circumstances, I was left with the distinct impression
                    that there was a real possibility that the plaintiff had deleted and would
                    destroy or hide relevant documents if a search order were not
                ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As mentioned earlier, the damages that would
                    be suffered by the defendant would be very real and substantial and would be
                    hard to quantify. It also did not appear that the plaintiff would be in a
                    position to compensate such loss. Although search orders are by their nature
                    intrusive of privacy, it was imperative that such orders be made in this case.
                    The plaintiff’s conduct regarding the MacBook was highly questionable and
                    his actions in evading service of the search orders lent further support to the
                    impression that he could not be fully trusted to cooperate and play a fair game.
                    The search was not disruptive to any business activities and there was no
                    evidence that the search party did anything untoward during the search. The
                    plaintiff had his solicitors with him and could have insisted on the search
                    party leaving his home at 5pm. It is not uncommon for subjects of search orders
                    to prefer that a search proceed beyond the stipulated hours so that it could
                    hopefully be completed within that day. Where the imaging of the
                    plaintiff’s wife’s laptop and her email account was concerned, the
                    directions I have given to the solicitors for both parties (set out in the last
                    sentence of <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) should be able to
                    resolve the matter quite swiftly if nothing of relevance is noted therein. The
                    information obtained could then be returned or destroyed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I was of the view that the non-disclosures
                    alleged by the plaintiff would not have materially affected my decision whether
                    or not to grant the orders sought. The Sunlink issue was a peripheral matter
                    and, in any case, the wrong information was neither egregious nor deliberate.
                    Where the MacBook was concerned, it was my understanding that data which was
                    potentially relevant had been deliberately erased and not that all data had been
                    deleted by the plaintiff. It would not have mattered to me if the defendant had
                    disclosed the alleged omissions in <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>
                    above. The fact remained that the forensic examination had uncovered deliberate
                    erasure of information in the last weeks of the plaintiff’s notice of
                    resignation while the MacBook was in the plaintiff’s custody and was being
                    used by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the circumstances, I made the orders and
                    directions set out in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                above.</p>
