In that judgment, this court upheld the constitutionality of the POFMA and ruled on the applicable burden and standard of proof in applications under s 17 of the POFMA. Consequently, counsel for the SDP indicated that it would not be pursuing its arguments on these points (see the Judgment at [7]). In <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>(at [163]), this court also set out a five-step analytical framework for determining whether a direction made under Part 3 of the POFMA (which includes CDs issued under s 11 of the POFMA) may be set aside under ss 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA (“the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework”): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court should determine the Minister’s intended meaning in respect of the subject statement that he has identified in the relevant direction.

An objective approach applies in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the court should determine (on an objective approach) whether the identified subject statement is “false” in the sense explained in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the court should consider whether the identified subject statement has been, or is being, communicated in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 28 March 2022, the Judge heard the OS on its merits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Judge’s decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In his Judgment issued on 10 May 2022, the Judge first set out his reasons for dismissing the SDP’s preliminary application for the OS to be heard in open court. The Judge noted that the default starting position for all originating summonses, as set out in O 28 r 2 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC 2014”), was that they should be heard in chambers. The POFMA did not exclude the application of this provision or specify a different starting position for applications under s 17 of the POFMA. The question was therefore whether special reasons existed to warrant an open court hearing. The Judge found that no such reasons existed. Accordingly, the Judge dismissed this preliminary application (see the Judgment at [15], [26] and [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Judge then applied the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework to the SDP’s substantive application to set aside the CD under s 17(5) of the POFMA. The Judge’s findings in respect of the first, second and fifth steps of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework are not in issue here. For the purposes of this application, the key portions of the Judge’s decision relate to the third and fourth steps of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework. At the third step, the Judge found that both sentences of the Subject Statement purported to be a report of Dr Cheong’s Statement and that both were statements of fact (see the Judgment at [60] and [63]). At the fourth step, the Judge held that the Subject Statement was false for two reasons (see the Judgment at [67] and [73]–[83]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the SDP had chosen to steer away from Mr Aw’s Letter which made clear that the figures in Dr Cheong’s Statement pertained to living<span class="font-italic"> </span>density (which took into account only the land available for urban areas) and not population<span class="font-italic"> </span>density. The Judge inferred from the evidence before him that the SDP was aware of Mr Aw’s Letter at all material times and had deliberately substituted “living density” in Dr Cheong’s Statement with “population density” in the SDP Article and applied Dr Cheong’s figures for living density to Singapore’s total land area.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the SDP must have known that the density in Dr Cheong’s Statement could not simply be applied over Singapore’s total land area because, on a “back of the envelope” calculation, applying this figure to Singapore’s total land area would yield a figure of 7.92 million persons at the time of the IPS Lecture. At that time, however, Singapore’s population was not even 6.9 million persons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Accordingly, the Judge dismissed the OS and declined to set aside the CD (see the Judgment at [93]). On 24 May 2022, the SDP filed the present application for leave to appeal against the Judge’s decision.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 We do not accept this argument. On a plain reading of s 17(8) of the POFMA, its effect was that the right of appeal from a decision under s 17 would be the same as that from decisions made by the High Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. In other words, s 17(8) made clear that s 34 and the Fourth and Fifth Schedules to the then-prevailing Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the 2007 SCJA”) would apply equally to decisions made under s 17 of the POFMA. This was put beyond doubt by r 16 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation) Rules 2019 (No S 665) (“the POFMA Rules”), which provided expressly that appeals against POFMA decisions “may, in accordance with paragraph 1(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act<span class="font-italic"> </span>[which is now para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA], be brought to the Court of Appeal only with the leave of the [High] Court or the Court of Appeal”. The POFMA Rules first came into operation on 2 October 2019 together with the POFMA itself (see r 1 of the POFMA Rules).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 There is therefore no basis for the SDP’s contention that POFMA decisions were appealable as of right at the time the POFMA was enacted. Instead, both s 17(8) of the POFMA and r 16 of the POFMA Rules provide a clear indication that appeals against POFMA decisions were always intended to be subject to the same restrictions as appeals against decisions made by the High Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. This weighs against the SDP’s suggestion that a different approach to permission to appeal was intended to be (or should be) applied to POFMA cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legislative history of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Turning to the legislative history of the Fifth Schedule, the SDP asserts that the requirement in para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of permission to appeal from POFMA decisions was introduced without explanation by the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill. The SDP cites <span class="font-italic">R (on the application of Maughan) v Her Majesty’s Senior Coroner for Oxfordshire </span>[2020] UKSC 46 at [44], where the UK Supreme Court noted that it would “be contrary to drafting conventions for a schedule to the Rules [in this case, the Coroners (Inquests) Rules 2013 (SI 2013/1616) (UK)] to be used to make what would clearly be a change of some consequence in the law”. The crux of the SDP’s submissions is therefore that it was inappropriate for this restriction on the right to appeal from POFMA decisions to be introduced by way of an amendment to the Fifth Schedule which – based on the Parliamentary debates on the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill – purported to be merely procedural in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 However, a closer examination of the legislative history shows that the SDP’s position is not correct. The provision that is now para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA was first introduced as para 1(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the 2007 SCJA (as was in force from 2 October 2019 to 11 September 2020). It was not inserted by the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill but by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Amendment of Fifth Schedule) Order 2019 (S 666/2019) with effect from 2 October 2019. This was the date of commencement of the POFMA itself: see the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (Commencement) Notification 2019 at para 2. The requirement of permission to appeal against POFMA decisions has thus existed since the inception of the POFMA and indeed was introduced alongside<span class="font-italic"> </span>s 17(8) of the POFMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 A few days after the POFMA came into force, the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill was read in Parliament for the first time on 7 October 2019. Clause 23 of this Bill repealed and re-enacted substantially the Fifth Schedule, renumbering para 1(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the 2007 SCJA as para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA. On 5 November 2019, at the Second Reading of the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill, the then Senior Minister of State for Law stated that the Bill would “facilitat[e] a better use of judicial resources and also introduc[e] procedural amendments to enhance the flexibility and also the efficiency of Court processes” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(5 November 2019) vol 94 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)). The fact that these comments suggested that the relevant amendments were purely procedural in nature is readily explicable on the basis that the permission to appeal requirement for POFMA decisions was already<span class="font-italic"> </span>in the Fifth Schedule and was not introduced by the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill. There is therefore no basis for suggesting that the permission to appeal requirement was somehow slipped into the Fifth Schedule by the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill after the POFMA was enacted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Substantive rights of the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The SDP also argues that POFMA decisions should be appealable as of right because such decisions dispose of the parties’ substantive rights.

As explained by the Senior Minister of State for Law at the material time, the 2010 SCJ Amendment Bill “streamline[d] and restrict[ed] appeals to the Court of Appeal on interlocutory matters”, which would now be “categorised based on their importance to the substantive outcome of the case”. However, “[t]he right to appeal all the way to the Court of Appeal [would] … remain for interlocutory applications that could affect the final outcome of the case” and “the right of appeal for substantive matters heard at first instance by the High Court remain[ed] unchanged”. Thus, for example, a High Court Judge’s decision to strike out a claim would be appealable to the Court of Appeal as of right because such a decision “means that the case can no longer proceed to trial and it would clearly put an end to the party’s substantive rights” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 October 2010) vol 87 at cols 1369–1370 and 1385–1386 (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Law)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The SDP also refers to this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 354 (“<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James Michael</span>”).

</div> This would be for the propositions that the Fifth Schedule was only intended to curtail rights of appeal against interlocutory orders made at the hearing of interlocutory applications and that Parliament had intended that an appeal to the Court of Appeal ought to remain as of right where a final order disposing of the parties’ substantive rights was made (<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James Michael</span> at [52], [84] and [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In our judgment, there is no legal rule that in cases where permission to appeal is required<span class="font-italic"> </span>under the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA, permission ought to be granted where the decision below disposes of the parties’ substantive rights. A similar argument was rejected recently in <span class="font-italic">VXF</span>, where the Appellate Division of the High Court held that the fact that a party’s substantive rights were affected by the judgment below was “not a reason <span class="font-italic">per se </span>to grant permission to appeal” (<span class="font-italic">VXF </span>at [21]). In the same paragraph, the Appellate Division clarified that the decision of Woo Bih Li J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Aries Telecoms (M) Bhd v ViewQwest Pte Ltd (Fiberail Sdn Bhd, third party) </span>[2017] 4 SLR 728 “does not stand for the proposition that where a substantive right is engaged and where permission to appeal would otherwise be necessary, it would follow that permission to appeal should be granted”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In this regard, a distinction ought to be drawn between restrictions relating to substantive matters as opposed to those concerning interlocutory matters on the one hand and restrictions relating to the subject matter of the intended appeal<span class="font-italic"> </span>on the other hand. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Kosui Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu </span>[2016] 2 SLR 105 (“<span class="font-italic">Kosui</span>”), this court rejected the appellant’s contention (made in reliance on, among other authorities, <span class="font-italic">Dorsey </span><span class="font-italic">James Michael</span>) that an appeal had to lie as of right where the parties’ substantive rights were concerned. Instead, where the relevant restriction on the right to appeal was a “subject-matter restriction”, it was “irrelevant” that the decision in question affected a party’s substantive rights. For example, the contention that the right to appeal could not be excluded if the matter pertained to a substantive right was “plainly contradicted” by the requirement of leave to appeal against a summary decision on an interpleader summons, where the facts are agreed, under s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the 2007 SCJA (now para 3(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA) (see <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [26] and [28]). In <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>itself, the relevant subject-matter restriction was found in s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 2007 SCJA (now para 3(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA), which stated that leave to appeal was required where “the only issue in the appeal relates to costs or fees for hearing dates” (see <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [30]; see also <span class="font-italic">Lin Jianwei v Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and another </span>[2021] 2 SLR 683 (“<span class="font-italic">Lin Jianwei</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 We would add that subject-matter restrictions on appeals could also exist in terms of the value of the claim in issue so that claims falling below a specified amount are appealable only with the permission of the court. This is essential for the good administration of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Returning to the present application, para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA (like paras 3(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and 3(<span class="font-italic">g</span>)) plainly imposes a subject-matter restriction on the right to appeal. Consequently, it is irrelevant that decisions falling within the scope of this paragraph may dispose of the parties’ substantive rights. According to the plain words of para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>), POFMA decisions listed in that paragraph are appealable only with permission.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the applicable principles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For the reasons that we have explained above, it is clear that POFMA decisions are not, and were not at any stage, appealable as of right to the Court of Appeal. Similarly, we do not accept the SDP’s submissions that we should apply different principles or a different legal test when considering applications for permission to appeal against POFMA decisions or the SDP’s contention that permission to appeal should normally be granted as a matter of course. No justification has been shown for creating this special category of cases for the purpose of determining whether permission to appeal should be granted. On the contrary, both the wording of the relevant statutory provisions and their legislative history indicate that permission to appeal against POFMA decisions was intended to be subject to the same restrictions that apply in respect of non-POFMA decisions made by the General Division of the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 We will therefore deal with the SDP’s application on the basis that permission to appeal will only be granted if the SDP establishes one or more of the three well-established grounds set out in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan</span><span class="font-italic"> Yew </span>at [16] (and recently reaffirmed by this court in <span class="font-italic">Lin Jianwei </span>at [85]): (a) a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error; (b) a question of general principle decided for the first time; or (c) a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As a preliminary point, we agree with the AG’s submissions that the SDP is out of time to apply for permission to appeal against the Judge’s decision to hear the OS in chambers. As noted at [11] above, the SDP’s preliminary application for the OS to be heard in open court was dismissed by the Judge on 11 September 2020, although the Judge’s detailed reasons for this decision were set out in the Judgment issued on 10 May 2022. This decision, which did not dispose of or determine the parties’ substantive rights in the OS, was an interlocutory order at the hearing of an interlocutory application. Leave to appeal was required under what was then para 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the 2007 SCJA. Pursuant to O 56 r 3(1) of the ROC 2014, the SDP would have had to apply to the Judge for leave to appeal against this decision within seven days from the date of the Judge’s order (by 18 September 2020). Even if leave was not<span class="font-italic"> </span>required to appeal against this particular decision, the SDP would have had to file and serve its notice of appeal within one month from 11 September 2020, pursuant to O 57 r 4 of the ROC 2014. It did not do so. Accordingly, the Open Court Question would not arise for this court’s determination in any appeal against the Judgment as the SDP is clearly out of time to pursue this point further. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Even if the Open Court Question is<span class="font-italic"> </span>an issue to be decided in any appeal by the SDP against the Judge’s decision, it is neither a question of general principle nor a question of importance.

</div>
</div> Order 28 r 2 of the ROC 2014 stated that all originating summonses would be heard in chambers unless otherwise provided. Rule 5(1) of the POFMA Rules expressly requires appeals under ss 17, 29, 35 or 44 of the POFMA to be brought by way of originating summons. Rules 11(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 11(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA Rules provide that the court hearing a POFMA appeal may “give such directions for the hearing of the appeal as the Court thinks fit” and “conduct the hearing of the appeal in such manner as the Court thinks fit”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On a plain reading of these provisions, the SDP’s argument that rr 11(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 11(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA Rules should apply instead of O 28 r 2 of the ROC 2014 is unsustainable. As the Judge noted (at [26] of the Judgment), the POFMA could have excluded the application of O 28 r 2 or specified a different default position for applications under s 17 of the POFMA but that was not done. Rules 11(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 11(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA Rules do not provide for any default position as to the manner of hearing POFMA appeals. It is therefore clear that the default position set out in O 28 r 2 of the ROC 2014 applies even in respect of POFMA cases. In any event, a decision under rr 11(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 11(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA Rules would be the product of an exercise of discretion in the circumstances of each case, as evidenced by the words “as the [c]ourt thinks fit”. Such judgment calls made after considering particular factual situations would not raise any question of general principle or importance (see <span class="font-italic">IW v IX </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 135 (“<span class="font-italic">IW</span>”) at [27]–[28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Further, the legal principles regarding when a departure from the default statutory position in O 28 r 2 of the ROC 2014 would be justified are well established: the applicant seeking an open court hearing must show “special reasons” (<span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin v Attorney-General </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 735 (“<span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin</span>”) at [7]). This was the test applied by the Judge (at [15] and [27] of the Judgment) and the SDP does not suggest that the Judge made any <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>error in this regard. The SDP submits that the “special reasons” test should be reversed in the POFMA context so that POFMA appeals should be heard in open court unless<span class="font-italic"> </span>there are special reasons for them to be heard in chambers.

</div> However, this argument was expressly rejected by the Judge (at [11]–[12] of the Judgment) and again, the SDP does not contend that the Judge made a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>error on this point. Indeed, the Judge noted that counsel for the SDP had accepted that even if an issue was of public interest, that alone would not constitute a special reason for the matter to be heard in open court (see [26] of the Judgment). More fundamentally, the possibility of a general<span class="font-italic"> </span>rule that it was in the public interest for particular categories of proceedings to be heard in open court was rejected with “no hesitation” by Andrew Phang JA in <span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin </span>at [7].

This requires an objective<span class="font-italic"> </span>approach in ascertaining whether the identified subject statement is a statement of fact (<span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [158] and [163(c)]). The fourth step of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework then requires the court to determine whether the identified subject statement, as understood according to the Minister’s intended meaning, is “false” in the sense of being “false or misleading, whether wholly or in part, and whether on its own or in the context in which it appears” (s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA).

The Judge also held that the Subject Statement was a false<span class="font-italic"> </span>statement of fact for the reasons summarised at [15] above. Moreover, because the Subject Statement purported to be an accurate report of Dr Cheong’s Statement, it should have taken the clarification in Mr Aw’s Letter into account, as this was published in response to Mr Cheang’s Forum Letter on which the SDP Article was premised (see the Judgment at [85]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The SDP does not argue that the Judge made a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>error in arriving at the conclusions above.

</div> Instead, the SDP’s contention is that in cases where the identified subject statement is a report of a statement made by someone else, the third and fourth steps of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework should be approached differently, such that the relevant question is whether the statement made by the original statement maker (here, Dr Cheong) and the statement made by the party who reports that statement and receives the CD (here, the SDP) “reasonably could be taken to mean the same thing”.

</div> Applying this proposed approach, the SDP submits that since “living density” and “population density” might reasonably be taken to mean the same thing, Dr Cheong’s Statement was reasonably construed to mean that Singapore’s population<span class="font-italic"> </span>density would increase from 11,000 people <span class="font-italic">per </span>sq km to 13,700 people <span class="font-italic">per </span>sq km between then and 2030.

At the third step of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework, the statement of fact made by the Subject Statement was that it reported what had in fact been said in Dr Cheong’s Statement. At the fourth step of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework, this statement of fact was false given that Dr Cheong’s Statement had referred to Singapore’s “living density” (see [4] above).

</div> Mr Aw’s Letter then clarified that the figures cited by Dr Cheong related to “living density” rather than “population density” and explained the key difference between these two terms for the purposes of calculating population size. For this reason, the Subject Statement, viewed objectively, was false or misleading. Even if it was reasonable for the SDP to take “living density” and “population density” to mean the same thing, this is immaterial. It is not relevant that the SDP believed subjectively that the Subject Statement was an accurate report of Dr Cheong’s Statement if the Subject Statement was objectively a false or misleading report of the same (see <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>at [159]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Report of Statement Question is therefore not a question of general principle or importance that would arise in an appeal against the Judge’s decision. The issues of whether a subject statement which is a report of a statement made by someone else is a “statement of fact” and whether that statement of fact is “false” can be answered by an application of the principles set out at the third and fourth steps of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework and no further explanation is needed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Opinion Question </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The final question framed by the SDP is the Opinion Question: what is a statement of opinion (as opposed to a statement of fact) for the purposes of the POFMA?

</div> The SDP submits that an important issue arising from the Judge’s decision is “what formulation of words is necessary to mark a statement as an opinion for the purposes of [the] POFMA” and “how statements may be identified as opinion”.

</div> The key part of the Subject Statement in this regard is the second sentence – “Given our land area, this means that our population would go up to nearly 10 million by 2030” – which the SDP contends demonstrates a deductive process and marks the Subject Statement as one of opinion rather than fact.

</div> The Judge, however, held that this second sentence was not merely the SDP’s opinion of what Dr Cheong’s Statement would mean. Instead, it was a statement of fact<span class="font-italic"> </span>because it purported to be a report of what Dr Cheong’s Statement had said in fact (see the Judgment at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In our view, the Opinion Question is not a question of general principle or importance because its resolution turns ultimately on the specific facts of each case. No general answer, much less any particular “formulation of words”, can be prescribed. Although the POFMA does not define the phrase “statement of opinion”, the key phrase “statement of fact” is defined in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA (as set out at [52] above), which – as the Court of Appeal clarified in <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>at [158] – requires the court to take an objective approach in ascertaining whether the identified subject statement falls within that definition. As the AG submits, the question of how a particular statement should be construed is a question of fact and there can be no set formula because it depends on the specific facts and context.

</div> However, the question of how these illustrations should be construed would not arise for determination on appeal. It was not contended that the Subject Statement was based on either “incomplete” or “fabricated” data and that it therefore does not fall within the scope of either para B(xiii) or para B(13) of the MinLaw Paper.

After the SDP applied unsuccessfully to the Minister to cancel the CD, it appealed to the High Court under s 17 of the POFMA to set aside the CD (“the OS”). The High Court judge (“the Judge”) first dismissed the SDP’s preliminary oral application for the OS to be heard in open court and directed that it be heard in chambers. After hearing the OS on its merits, the Judge dismissed the OS and declined to set aside the CD. The SDP then filed the present originating application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the Judge’s decision. The Attorney-General (“the AG”) opposed the application, submitting that permission to appeal should not be granted.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The SDP argued that permission to appeal should normally be granted in POFMA cases and that the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 should not be applied in this context. The SDP also contended that the requirement for permission to appeal in POFMA cases (as set out in para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA) was anomalous and inconsistent with the wording of s 17(8) of the POFMA. Further, the SDP submitted that even if the <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew </span>principles were applied, permission to appeal should be granted because the OS involved questions of general principle decided for the first time (“questions of general principle”) and questions of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage (“questions of importance”). These questions, as framed by the SDP, were as follows:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. What are the principles (if any) that apply to applications for permission to appeal against POFMA decisions? (“the Permission Principles Question”)</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b.  When should a POFMA appeal be heard in open court? (“the Open Court Question”)</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. How should the third and fourth steps of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework<span class="font-italic"> </span>be applied to a situation where the subject statement is a report of a statement made by someone else?

Section 17(8) of the POFMA and r 16 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation) Rules 2019 (No S 665), which first came into operation together with the POFMA itself, provided a clear indication that appeals against POFMA decisions were always intended to be subject to the same restrictions as appeals against decisions made by the High Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. This weighed against the SDP’s suggestion that a different approach to permission to appeal was intended to be (or should be) applied to POFMA cases: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">27]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[28]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 Next, the court rejected the SDP’s assertion that the requirement of permission to appeal from POFMA decisions in para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the Fifth Schedule was introduced without explanation by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 32/2019) (“the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill”), by way of an amendment to the Fifth Schedule which purported to be merely procedural in nature. The provision that was now para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) was first introduced as para 1(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (as was in force from 2 October 2019 to 11 September 2020). It was not inserted by the 2019 SCJ Amendment Bill but by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Amendment of Fifth Schedule) Order 2019 (S 666/2019) with effect from 2 October 2019 – the date of commencement of the POFMA itself. The requirement of permission to appeal against POFMA decisions had thus existed since the inception of the POFMA: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[30]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 Third, the court rejected the SDP’s argument that POFMA decisions should be appealable as of right because such decisions disposed of the parties’ substantive rights. There was no legal rule that in cases where permission to appeal was required<span class="font-italic"> </span>under the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA, permission ought to be granted where the decision below disposed of the parties’ substantive rights. A distinction ought to be drawn between restrictions relating to substantive matters as opposed to those concerning interlocutory matters on the one hand, and restrictions relating to the subject matter of the intended appeal<span class="font-italic"> </span>on the other hand. Where the relevant restriction on the right to appeal was a subject-matter restriction, it was irrelevant that the decision in question affected a party’s substantive rights. As para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the Fifth Schedule to the SCJA plainly imposed a subject-matter restriction on the right to appeal, it was irrelevant that decisions falling within the scope of this paragraph might dispose of the parties’ substantive rights. According to the plain words of para 3(<span class="font-italic">m</span>), POFMA decisions listed in that paragraph were appealable only with permission: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[34]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[35]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">37]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The court therefore rejected the SDP’s position that different principles or a different legal test should apply when considering applications for permission to appeal against POFMA decisions, and that permission to appeal should normally be granted as a matter of course. Permission to appeal would only be granted if the SDP established one or more of the well-established grounds set out in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew</span>: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[38] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[39]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Whether permission to appeal should be granted</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 Applying those principles, the SDP’s application for permission to appeal was dismissed as none of the questions framed by the SDP could be regarded as questions of general principle or importance which would arise for decision in an appeal against the Judge’s decision in the OS: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[62]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The Permission Principles Question was not a question that arose from the Judge’s decision, nor was it one which would arise in the substantive appeal against the Judge’s decision.

The default position stated in O 28 r 2 of the ROC 2014 (now O 15 r 1(1) of the ROC 2021) was that all originating summonses would be heard in chambers, and this applied even in respect of POFMA cases. The legal principles regarding when a departure from this default statutory position would be justified were well established: the applicant seeking an open court hearing had to show “special reasons”. This was a fact-sensitive inquiry to which no general answer could be given: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[45]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">50]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The Report of Statement Question was not a question of general principle or importance that would arise in an appeal against the Judge’s decision. The issues of whether a subject statement which was a report of a statement made by someone else was a “statement of fact” and whether that statement of fact was “false” could be answered by an application of the principles set out at the third and fourth steps of the analytical framework in <span class="font-italic">The Online Citizen Pte Ltd v Attorney-General and another appeal and other matters</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2021] 2 SLR 1358. No further explanation was needed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[56]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 The Opinion Question was not a question of general principle or importance that would arise for determination in an appeal against the Judge’s decision because its resolution turned ultimately on the specific facts of each case. The court had to take an objective approach in ascertaining whether the identified subject statement fell within the definition of a “statement of fact” in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA. The question of how a particular statement should be construed was a question of fact and there could be no set formula because it depended on the specific facts and context: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[58]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[61]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
