<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused, Sujay Solomon Sutherson, who was
                    unrepresented, claimed trial to the following charge:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you … are charged that you, on 27 May 2012, sometime between
                        6.30 p.m. to 10.45 p.m., at Blk 248 Bukit Batok East Ave 5, #02-66,
                        Singapore, did commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder, to wit, by
                        repeatedly stabbing one Mallika Jesudasan on her neck with multiple knives,
                        which act was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as was
                        likely to cause the death of the said Mallika Jesudasan, and you have
                        thereby committed an offence punishable under section 304(a) of the Penal
                        Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the
                    accused and sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment which was ordered to
                    commence from 29 May 2012, the date he was first placed on remand. He has filed
                    an appeal against the sentence imposed, and I provide my detailed
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In support of their case, the Prosecution led
                    three strands of evidence. The first concerned the circumstances leading to the
                    discovery of the body. The second concerned the statements made by the accused.
                    The third pertained to the scientific and medical evidence, including evidence
                    that at the material time, the accused was suffering from paranoid
                    schizophrenia. I will set out each in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Circumstances leading to the discovery of the body</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The deceased, Mallika Jesudasan, was the mother
                    of the accused. She was last seen alive at home in their flat (“the
                    flat”) by her daughter, Sheena Sutherson (“Sheena”), before
                    Sheena left the flat to meet a friend at about 6.30pm on 27 May 2012. At about
                    10.35pm, Sunil Sutherson (“Sunil”), the deceased’s second
                    son, returned home to find that the door had been latched from the inside. He
                    used his mobile phone to call the house phone. When the accused answered the
                    call, Sunil asked him to unlock the door. The accused replied that he would do
                    so after he had cleaned the house. Sunil thought this strange as the accused
                    never did any house-cleaning. After a few minutes, the accused unlocked the
                    door.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       When Sunil entered the flat, the accused
                    retreated to the bedroom which he shared with Sunil and locked the door. Sunil
                    could not find the deceased at home. When he called her mobile phone, it was
                    switched off. Then, Sunil called Sheena to inform her of the situation and asked
                    her to rush home. Sheena returned home several minutes later. When Sunil and
                    Sheena searched the home, they noticed that several things were amiss. First, a
                    bottle of vodka, a stainless steel knife, and a stove lighter were placed on the
                    table in the kitchen when they were not normally stored there. Second, they
                    noticed that there were scraps of burnt paper and fabric in the room shared by
                    Sheena and the deceased. Lastly, they noticed that the floor was very sticky and
                    it seemed like many pieces of furniture had been moved from their original
                    positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       A while later, Daniel Jesudason
                    (“Daniel”), the deceased’s brother, arrived. He had made his
                    way to the flat after learning that the deceased was missing. Sunil and Sheena
                    informed him of their observations. As they were unable to find the deceased,
                    Daniel, Sunil, and Sheena left the flat and walked around the neighbourhood to
                    continue the search but the search proved futile. About ten minutes later, they
                    returned to the flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       By then, the items on the kitchen table were no
                    longer there and the burnt material on the floor had been cleaned up. Sunil
                    walked into the bedroom he shared with the accused. He noticed that several
                    boxes which were usually stored underneath the accused’s bed were out of
                    place. He asked Daniel to take a closer look. As Daniel was about to pull a
                    suitcase from underneath the accused’s bed, the accused rushed in and
                    attempted to stop him. Daniel persisted in pulling the suitcase out, and he saw
                    a pair of legs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Daniel cried out in shock and informed Sunil and
                    Sheena that the deceased was under the bed. He then shouted for Sunil to call
                    the police. The accused rushed out of his bedroom and latched the main door of
                    the flat. He then confronted Sunil and demanded that he not call the police.
                    Seeing this, Daniel grabbed hold of the accused in an attempt to stop him from
                    getting close to Sunil and a scuffle ensued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Meanwhile, Sunil managed to get through to the
                    emergency operator and shouted his address before putting down his mobile phone
                    in an attempt to placate the accused. The accused demanded that Sunil and Sheena
                    hand their mobile phones to him, which they did. Around then, Daniel’s
                    wife called him on his mobile phone. Daniel answered, hurriedly informing her
                    that the deceased had been killed and requesting her to call the police
                    immediately. The accused then approached Daniel and demanded that he surrender
                    his mobile phone. Seeing that the accused was occupied, Sunil took this
                    opportunity to unlatch the main door and run out of the flat to get help. The
                    accused tried to stop him but he was intercepted by Daniel. In the scuffle which
                    followed, Daniel sustained a cut on his left eyebrow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Soon after, the police arrived. One of the
                    police officers, Senior Staff Sergeant Mohamed Jasmani Bin Mohamed Hassan
                    (“SSSGT Jasmani”), questioned the accused, who stated that he
                    stabbed the deceased after a quarrel. Following this, SSSGT Jasmani entered the
                    accused’s room whereupon he noticed the deceased’s leg protruding
                    from beneath the bed. When he lifted the mattress slightly, he caught a glimpse
                    of the deceased’s body, which lay on the floor wrapped in a blood-soaked
                    blanket. Soon after, Senior Station Inspector Riduan Bin Hamid (“SSI
                    Riduan”) arrived at the flat. Together, they questioned the accused. The
                    accused was initially reticent but eventually informed them that he stabbed the
                    deceased after an altercation. Upon hearing this, they placed the accused under
                    arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statements of the accused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Next, I go to the statements given by the
                    accused to the police. Apart from the oral statements made immediately prior to
                    his arrest to SSSGT Jasmani and SSI Riduan set out at [10] above, there were
                    five written statements recorded under the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15
                    of 2010) (“CPC”). In chronological order, they were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     A statement recorded under s 22 of
                        the CPC on 28 May 2012 from 4.25am to 5.05am by Deputy Superintendent Foo
                        Jit Choon.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
                        statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC on 28 May 2012 from 12.15pm to
                        2.00pm (“the cautioned statement”). On this occasion, the
                        accused elected to write down his account of the events himself. He did so
                        in the presence of ASP Tan Lee Chye Raymond after being administered the
                        statutory warning.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     A statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC on 30 May 2012 from
                        10.10am to 12.25pm (“the second long statement”) by the
                        investigation officer, ASP Tan Lian Heng (“IO
                    Tan”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     A
                        statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC on 30 May 2012 from 4.50pm to
                        6.40pm (“the third long statement”) by IO
                    Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     A statement
                        recorded under s 22 of the CPC on 31 May 2012 from 10.35am to 12.27pm
                        (“the fourth long statement”) by IO Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The accused did not challenge the
                    admissibility of the five written statements, and they were duly admitted into
                    evidence. The fourth long statement only related to details of the
                    accused’s personal background so I shall say no more of it. As for the
                    other four statements, the contents were largely consistent, albeit with minor
                    discrepancies as to the precise sequence of events and the length of time that
                    transpired between them. In essence, the accused narrated that he quarrelled
                    with the deceased and that, in the course of the altercation, he stabbed the
                    deceased in the neck with knives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The cautioned statement and the second long
                    statement provided the most detailed accounts of the events. In them, the
                    accused described that the deceased had given him some money to purchase food
                    for the two of them. After returning home with the food, he changed out before
                    sitting down to consume his food in the living room while the deceased consumed
                    her food in her bedroom. After that, the deceased came out of her bedroom and
                    asked the accused if he had any money for her. He answered in the negative and
                    proceeded to the kitchen to wash his plate. The deceased stood at the door of
                    the kitchen and continued to ask the accused for money. The deceased then turned
                    inexplicably violent. She lunged at him, pulled his hair, scratched his face and
                    tried to pull his shorts off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The accused reacted by picking up a knife with
                    a blue handle from the kitchen counter and stabbed the accused in the neck,
                    leaving the knife embedded in the side of the deceased’s neck. The
                    deceased staggered back towards her bedroom and tried to reach for the phone.
                    The accused returned to the kitchen to retrieve a second knife (“a knife
                    with a black handle”, as the accused recounted in the second long
                    statement) which he used to stab the deceased in her throat, causing her to
                    collapse. The accused explained in the third long statement he stabbed her for a
                    second time to “prevent her from calling someone”. After this, the
                    deceased’s eyes changed. She writhed on the floor for some time and spoke
                    in an incomprehensible language. The accused stared at her body before
                    retrieving a third knife (a “silver butterfly knife”) and slit her
                    throat. In the third long statement, he explained that he did so to ensure that
                    he would not get “attacked again”. Once again, the accused stared
                    at her body for a period of time before deciding to dispose of the
                body.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The accused wrapped the deceased in bedsheets
                    and blankets, covered her with some old newspapers and doused her in alcohol
                    (from the vodka bottle and a bottle of rice wine) before attempting to set her
                    alight with a stove lighter. However, he only managed to singe parts of the
                    deceased’s clothing before the fire died out. The accused then took steps
                    to hide the body. He wrapped the deceased up in more bedsheets and blankets
                    before dragging her from her bedroom to his own where he placed her underneath
                    his bed, rearranging some of the items beneath the bed in order to hide the body
                    from view. He then mopped the floor in an attempt to remove all traces of blood
                    from the flat. While he was in the midst of cleaning, Sunil returned home
                    whereupon the body was found.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Scientific and medical evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The final strand of evidence adduced pertained
                    to the results of DNA analyses, the autopsy performed on the deceased’s
                    body and the psychiatric reports concerning the accused’s mental
                    state.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">DNA evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the course of investigations, a large
                    number of exhibits and swabs were taken from the flat, and sent by the police to
                    the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for DNA analysis. Further,
                    the police also collected samples from certain persons, including the accused,
                    for analysis by the HSA so as to generate their DNA profiles. If any of the DNA
                    profiles obtained from the exhibits or swabs were to match a DNA profile of one
                    of the persons, then an inference could be drawn that the person had handled the
                    exhibit in question or was present at the scene.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Admissibility of a report with the accused’s DNA profile </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In this regard, an issue arose regarding the
                    admissibility of a report prepared by one Ms Tang Wai Man, formerly an analyst
                    in the employ of the HSA, who had returned to reside in Hong Kong and was not
                    present for the trial. Ms Tang’s report detailed the DNA profile of the
                    accused based on her analysis of a blood sample collected from him. Should the
                    Prosecution intend to rely on the DNA evidence to establish that the accused was
                    present at the scene of the crime and or that he had handled certain exhibits,
                    the report would be important. As Ms Tang was not available as a witness, the
                    report was hearsay evidence and therefore inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On the second day of the trial, 7 July 2015,
                    the Prosecution indicated that they would be applying to admit the report under
                    s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997
                    Rev Ed) (“EA”): <em>viz</em>, that it was a
                    statement of relevant facts made by a person outside Singapore whose attendance
                    it would not be practicable to secure. On the same day, they served a written
                    notice to admit documentary hearsay evidence on the accused as required under s
                        32(4)(<em>a</em>) of the EA read with reg 2 of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Notice Requirements to Admit Hearsay Evidence)
                    Regulations 2012. While the accused did not clearly object to the admission of
                    the report, he indicated that he would prefer Ms Tang to be present. On 9 July
                    2015, the Prosecution made an oral application pursuant to s 279 of the CPC for
                    an ancillary hearing to be conducted for the court to determine the
                    admissibility of the report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the ancillary hearing, IO Tan testified as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ms Tang was present at the Committal
                        Hearing on 11 May 2015. At the conclusion of her testimony, she was served a
                        bond to secure her attendance and told of the trial dates. At that time, she
                        was still employed by the HSA and did not give any indication that she would
                        be resigning from her position.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Subsequently, Ms Tang resigned from the HSA, and her last
                        day of service was 14 June 2015. According to the immigration records
                        obtained from the Immigration Checkpoint Authority of Singapore, she left
                        Singapore on 18 June 2015 and, as at 9 July 2015, she had not returned to
                        Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     A
                        few days before the trial commenced on 6 July 2015, IO Tan sent a reminder
                        to Ms Tang to her email address with HSA but received no reply. On the first
                        day of the trial, IO Tan tried to contact Ms Tang on the telephone to
                        request for her attendance in court on 7 July 2015 instead of 9 July 2015 as
                        originally scheduled. He failed to reach her and soon discovered that she
                        had left Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Through HSA, IO Tan found out Ms Tang’s contact details in Hong
                        Kong and managed to speak with Ms Tang over the telephone on 8 July 2015.
                        She informed him that she would not be returning to Singapore in the near
                        future. Citing personal reasons, she also refused to return to Singapore to
                        testify on behalf of the Prosecution even though IO Tan informed her that
                        her travel expenses would be paid for and that she would be given a
                        subsistence allowance. IO Tan later followed up on the telephone
                        conversation with an email reducing the salient points of the discussion in
                        writing and asking Ms Tang if she would confirm that she did not wish to
                        return to Singapore. Ms Tang replied in the
                affirmative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Gimpex Ltd v Unity
                        Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal</em> [2015] 2 SLR
                    686 (“<em>Gimpex</em>”), the Court of Appeal
                    dealt with the admission of hearsay evidence under s 32(1)(<em>j</em>) of the EA. At [98], the Court of Appeal explained that s
                        32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) sets out two requirements: (a)
                    the witness must be outside of Singapore; and (b) it is not practicable to
                    secure his or her attendance. Based on the evidence of IO Tan, it was clear to
                    me that the former had been satisfied. As for the latter, the Court of Appeal
                    said at [99]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the second requirement, Prof Colin Tapper (“Prof
                        Tapper”) in <em>Cross and Tapper on
                            Evidence</em> (LexisNexis, 12th Ed, 2010) observed with regard to
                        s 116(2)(c) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c 44) (UK) (“the
                        CJA”) (which is <em>in pari materia</em> to s
                            32(1)(<em>j</em>)(iii) of the EA) (at p 607)
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… [t]he second condition, however, refers not to inability to
                            attend, but to <em>secure</em> attendance, and may
                            be satisfied by the recalcitrance of a witness outside the United
                            Kingdom. Reasonable practicality implies assessing the likely
                            effectiveness of taking normal steps to secure the attendance of the
                            witness, and considering in relation to such a judgment the importance
                            of the evidence, the degree of prejudice to the defence if it is
                            admitted, and the expense and inconvenience involved in securing
                            attendance. … [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On the facts, it seemed to me that it was not
                    practicable to secure Ms Tang’s attendance. At the close of the committal
                    hearing (which took place only two months before the trial), she had been
                    instructed to be available for the trial. After IO Tan discovered the fact of Ms
                    Tang’s departure from Singapore, he acted with considerable expedition and
                    took reasonable steps to secure her attendance. He managed to get in touch with
                    Ms Tang and requested her return to Singapore to testify. He informed her that
                    the cost of her return would be borne by the State and that she would be given a
                    subsistence allowance for the duration of her stay. Despite these efforts, Ms
                    Tang made it clear that she had no interest in returning to Singapore,
                    communicating this first over the telephone and then in writing (see [20(d)]
                    above). In my view, the requirements of s 32(1)(<em>j</em>)
                    of the EA had been satisfied. <em>Prima facie</em>, the
                    report was admissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     However, as the Court of Appeal clarified at
                    [103] of <em>Gimpex</em>, the fact that a document is
                    admissible under s 32(1) is not the end of the matter. The court still has a
                    residual discretion under s 32(3) to exclude hearsay evidence in the interests
                    of justice even in the absence of an objection from the other party. In applying
                    s 32(3), the issue is whether admissible evidence should be excluded because
                    other countervailing factors outweigh the benefit of having the evidence
                    admitted (see <em>Gimpex</em> at [105]). However, the Court
                    of Appeal opined that courts should not normally exercise their discretion to
                    exclude evidence that is admissible under the EA (see <em>Gimpex</em> at [109]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     There was no doubt that Ms Tang’s report
                    would be an important piece of evidence (see [17] and [18] above). When asked
                    about his position regarding the report, the accused did not allege any
                    impropriety in the testing process or in the process of the preparation of the
                    report. He informed me that he only wished to have the report
                    “explained”, by which he meant that he wanted general information
                    on how the report ought to be read. To that end, the Prosecution had arranged
                    for another HSA analyst, Ms Joyce Low Hui Koon (“Ms Low”), to
                    testify as to the DNA profiling procedure adopted by the HSA and to explain how
                    such reports are to be read. Given that the reliability of the report was not in
                    issue, and the fact that the accused’s concerns would be adequately
                    addressed by having Ms Low testify, I was satisfied that the accused’s
                    right to a fair trial would be preserved and did not see any reason to exercise
                    the discretion under s 32(3) to refuse the admission of Ms Tang’s report.
                    I should add that during cross-examination, the accused only asked Ms Low
                    general questions about the interpretation of the report and did not allege that
                    there had been any impropriety in Ms Tang’s analysis.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Dr George Paul, a Senior Consultant Forensic
                    Pathologist with the Forensic Medicine Division of the HSA, examined the body of
                    the deceased and prepared a detailed report in which he drew attention to three
                    distinct injuries (numbered “14”, “15”, and
                    “16” respectively). I will provide brief descriptions of
                    each:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     Injury 14 was described as an
                        “incised stab wound present on the outer front of right side
                        neck”. The wound was assessed as having a lateral (“right to
                        left”) depth of 17.6cm and was, in all likelihood, caused by a
                        “single edged somewhat thin bladed weapon or a double edged weapon
                        with one edge not so sharp”. Under cross-examination, Dr Paul
                        testified that this injury could have been caused by P234 which was seized
                        from the flat (see [25] above) and which the accused had referred to in his
                        statement as the “knife with the black handle” (see [14]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     Injury
                        15 was described as an “[i]ncised somewhat vertical wound … in
                        the upper outer part of right side of neck” which ran from
                        “right to left, somewhat upwards and backwards” and had a
                        total lateral depth of 13cm. Under cross examination, Dr Paul testified that
                        this injury could have been caused by P236 which was seized from the flat
                        (see [25] above) and which the accused had referred to in his statements as
                        the “silver butterfly knife” (see [14]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     Injury 16
                        was described as a “T” shaped wound within which a kitchen
                        knife with a blue handle (P 235, the same knife which was observed by the
                        police officers who attended at the scene and which was described by the
                        accused in his statements as the “knife with blue handle”: see
                        [25] and [14] above) was embedded. Dr Paul elaborated that the “wound
                        went from left to right” and had a total depth of
                13cm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Dr Paul concluded that “[d]eath in this
                    case was not as a result of a natural disease process” but was instead
                    attributable to “haemorrhage from multiple stab injuries to neck”
                        (<em>viz</em>, injuries 14 to16). He also opined that
                    injuries 14 to 16 “individually and collectively were sufficient to cause
                    death in the ordinary cause of nature.”</p>

                    and 22 October 2013, which were prepared by Dr Kenneth Koh, a senior consultant
                    with the Department of General and Forensic Psychiatry at the Institute of
                    Mental Health (“the IMH”) (“Dr Koh”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The first psychiatric report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In his first psychiatric report dated 22 June
                    2012 (“the first psychiatric report”), Dr Koh detailed the
                    psychiatric history of the accused. The accused first presented with symptoms of
                    mental illness in 2006. After he had waved knives at his uncle, he was taken to
                    the IMH by the police. Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, he was treated
                    with antipsychotic medication. For 11 days in May 2006, he was warded in IMH.
                    Initially, after his discharge, he attended his follow-up sessions. He started
                    to default on them around October 2006. He returned to the IMH in June 2007,
                    when he was admitted by his family members, who reported that he had behaved in
                    a hostile manner towards them. This time, he was warded for about a month. For
                    the next three and a half years, he duly attended his outpatient follow up
                    appointments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In February 2011, the deceased and Daniel
                    reported that he had been exhibiting symptoms of a relapse. The accused refused
                    to receive depot antipsychotic medication (<em>ie</em>,
                    medication delivered by injection and specially prepared to release the
                    antipsychotics in small amounts over a period of time, usually over a few weeks
                    or a month) and insisted that he only be prescribed oral antipsychotics instead.
                    He maintained this refusal in August 2011, when the deceased and Daniel informed
                    the IMH staff that his condition had deteriorated and that they suspected that
                    he had not been taking his medication regularly. They opined that the
                    accused’s condition had been under better control while he was on depot
                    medication. The accused refused the reinstatement of depot treatment but agreed
                    to be prescribed a higher dose of oral medication. During a home visit conducted
                    in November 2011, the deceased informed the IMH staff that she doubted that the
                    accused had been taking his medication regularly. However, the accused was
                    assessed to have been well during the three outpatient visits (in January,
                    March, and May 2012) that immediately preceded the date of the present
                    offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Dr Koh reported that the accused’s
                    family members informed him that the accused had not been well for several
                    months and that his condition had been deteriorating at an accelerating pace in
                    the period immediately preceding the offence. Sunil also informed Dr Koh that he
                    suspected that the accused had only pretended to take his medication and that he
                    threw it away when he thought nobody noticed. Sunil also said that the accused
                    was capable of behaving normally when others came to visit but that he regressed
                    to abnormal behaviour when he thought he was not being observed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In conclusion, Dr Koh maintained the diagnosis
                    of paranoid schizophrenia and opined that, at the material time, the
                    accused’s “thinking would have been significantly deranged from a
                    normal state such that his judgement [sic], impulse control and planning
                    abilities would have been severely compromised”. He observed that the
                    accused’s case is somewhat unusual because he appeared to “be
                    rather well at interviews, engaging in the conversation and being relevant in
                    speech and organized in his accounts”. Dr Koh explained that this was
                    because the accused’s intelligence “aids him in disguising his
                    symptoms”. However, his lucidity belied the fact that his condition had
                    regressed significantly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Dr Koh’s prognosis was not favourable.
                    He opined:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He is nonetheless, a <b><em>dangerous individual</em></b>
                        for the following reasons: He has a <em>serious mental
                            illness, but has </em><b><em>no insight
                            </em></b><em>into this</em>, causing him to be

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The second and third psychiatric reports</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Dr Koh’s second psychiatric report dated
                    24 July 2012 (“the second psychiatric report”) and his third
                    (“the third psychiatric report”) dated 30 April 2013 are not
                    comprehensive medical reports but more in the nature of clarificatory letters
                    sent in response to queries that had been raised by IO Tan. In the second
                    psychiatric report, Dr Koh opined that the accused “requires long term
                    medication and treatment” coupled with “close supervision”
                    to ensure that he remains compliant with his treatment regimen. Without such
                    treatment, the accused is “highly likely to suffer from a relapse of his
                    schizophrenia” and that he “can be a danger to himself and others
                    if he does not take his medication”. Dr Koh clarified that, even with
                    medication, there would still be a residual, albeit much reduced, chance of a
                    relapse. Dr Koh concluded by saying that the “best treatment”
                    would be for the accused to receive a “depot antipsychotic and be in a
                    facility where his consumption of oral antipsychotic medication can be enforced
                    and observed”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The focus of the third psychiatric report was
                    on the likelihood that the accused was a “person of unstable
                    character” who would be likely to reoffend and commit offences of like
                    nature in the future. Dr Koh acknowledged that the accused was not a person with
                    an established history of violence nor did he exhibit any psychopathic traits.
                    However, the concern was that the accused suffered from a major mental illness
                    but did not display any insight into his illness or his need for continuous
                    treatment. This, when viewed in light of the fact that the offence in question
                    was “sudden, unexpected and extreme, [and committed] with little apparent
                    warning” warranted the conclusion that the accused be considered a
                    “dangerous and unpredictable individual.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The fourth psychiatric report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In Dr Koh’s last report dated 22 October
                    2013 (“the fourth psychiatric report”), he noted that the accused
                    had been consuming antipsychotic medication regularly for the past year and that
                    his schizophrenia appeared to be in remission, though he continued to harbour
                    some “residual and possibly fixed delusions surrounding the alleged
                    murder”. Dr Koh opined that the accused was “fit to plead in
                    Court”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defence’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At the close of the Prosecution’s case,
                    the accused submitted that there was no case to answer. He cast doubt on the
                    accuracy of the evidence presented, arguing that the “statements made by
                    the witnesses do not correspond to the evidence being presented in
                    court”. I did not accept his submission that there was no case to answer,
                    and called on him to enter his defence. The accused elected to take the
                    stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The accused did not say much during his
                    evidence-in-chief save to intimate that the evidence had been fabricated. Under
                    cross-examination, however, he gave a full account of the events which broadly
                    resembled the version in his statements. The narrative began with him going
                    downstairs to purchase food. After he returned, he consumed his dinner in the
                    living room. At this point, the deceased “asked [him] about money”
                    and did not stop the questioning even after he entered the kitchen, continuing
                    to ask him “for money and more money.” After this, the deceased
                    attempted to “outrage his modesty” and “harm” him.
                    She grabbed him by the hair, scratched his face, and tried to take off his
                    T-shirt. The deceased also told him “I want a son” and tried to
                    take his clothes off. The accused also alluded to an earlier incident when the
                    deceased had stabbed him “slightly in the stomach” with a knife,
                    but said that that “it was not a big incident”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     After that, the accused attacked the deceased
                    with three knives, elaborating that “[o]ne was a black handle, one was a
                    blue handle, the third knife was a silver butterfly knife” as
                    follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first stabbing took place in the
                        kitchen immediately after the deceased allegedly grabbed him by the hair.
                        The accused reached for a knife which was on the kitchen counter and stabbed
                        the deceased in the neck. He said that he did not apprehend any threat to
                        his life at the time but said that it was a “spur of the moment
                        thing”. He accepted that when he stabbed her in the neck, he knew
                        that, left untreated, the deceased would probably die from the
                        injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        deceased then staggered back towards the common area outside her bedroom.
                        The accused then picked up a second knife. He returned to where the deceased
                        was, “wrestled with her for a while and … stabbed her in the
                        neck again”. He accepted that at this point, he could not reasonably
                        have apprehended any danger from her.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     Finally, he picked up a third knife and “cut her
                        throat from right to left”. He explained that he did so before he
                        “needed an end to her line of questioning about her---her
                        relationship with me so it seemed like the right thing to do at that
                        time”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     He then explained that he “swept all
                    the debris away and … mopped up the floor” and that he had some
                    difficulty trying to “push her under the bed”. Shortly after,
                    Sunil returned home.</p>

                        being a party to causing the death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Prosecution have particularised the charge
                    against the accused in terms of an offence under s 299 (see the charge set out
                    at [1]). More specifically, the Prosecution framed the charge under the
                        <em>second</em> out of the three limbs of s 299
                    (see the italicised portion of s 299 at [42]). Therefore, in order to make out
                    the charge as framed, the Prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that
                    the accused performed an act which caused the death of the deceased (“the
                        <em>actus reus</em>”), and that the accused
                    performed the act with the intention of causing such bodily injury as was likely
                    to cause death (“the <em>mens
                    rea</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The <em>actus reus</em>
                    requirement is straightforward: the inquiry is whether the accused had performed
                    an act which is causatively linked with the death of the deceased. What the
                        <em>mens rea</em> requires is more complicated. In my
                    view, the second limb of s 299 invites two separate inquiries. The first is a
                        <em>subjective</em> inquiry whether the accused
                    intended to inflict the particular injuries found on the deceased. The second is
                    an <em>objective</em> inquiry whether the particular
                    injuries were “likely to cause death”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Tham Kai Yau &amp; Ors v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [1977] 1 MLJ 174 (“<em>Tham Kai Yau</em>”), the Federal Court of Criminal Appeal
                    commented that the Malaysian Penal Code provisions relating to culpable homicide
                    and murder (which are <em>in pari materia</em> with the
                    Singapore provisions) are “probably the most tricky in the Code and are
                    so technical as frequently to lead to confusion”. The Federal Court
                    explained that there are two situations in which culpable homicide may be made
                    out: (a) where the elements of the offence of murder have been proved, but one
                    or more exceptions contained in s 300 apply; or (b) where the necessary degree
                    of <em>mens rea</em> in s 299 have been proved, but not the
                    special degrees of <em>mens rea</em> in s 300 (see
                    176G-176I).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It was similarly observed by the Indian

                    ‘murder’ its specie” (at 606B). In other words, all instances
                    of murder would also constitute culpable homicide, but not vice versa. In
                    delivering the judgment of the court, Sarkaria J, provided a comparative table
                    of the co-relation between ss 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (which are
                        <em>in pari materia</em> with ours), and also provided
                    what I think to be a harmonious reading of the two provisions. In summary, he
                    held:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first limb of s 299
                        (“intention of causing death”) and s 300(<em>a</em>) map onto each other and are coextensive. The
                        inquiry is fully subjective.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     The third limb of s 299 (“knowledge that he is
                        likely by such act to cause death”) corresponds with s 300(<em>d</em>). Both require knowledge of the probability of
                        causing death. The main difference is in the degree of probability that
                        death would result, with the latter requiring that the accused must know
                        that the act in question “is so imminently dangerous that it must in
                            <em>all</em> probability cause death or such bodily
                        injury as is likely to cause death”. Once again, the inquiry is fully
                        subjective.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        second limb of s 299 (“intention of causing such bodily injury as is
                        likely to cause death”) is unique in that it corresponds with
                            <em>both</em> ss 300(<em>b</em>) and 300(<em>c</em>). The point of
                        commonality between all is that they all demand proof of the accused’s
                        intention to cause bodily injury. The second limb of s 299 further requires
                        that the injury be likely to cause death. Section 300(<em>b</em>) requires proof of something more specific: <em>viz</em>, that the offender <em>knows</em> that the act in question will be likely to cause the
                        death of the specific person to whom the harm is caused. Section
                            300(<em>c</em>) only requires that the injury in
                        question be “sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
                        death.” In <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Poh Lye and
                            another</em> [2005] 4 SLR (R) 582 (“<em>Lim
                            Poh Lye</em>”), our Court of Appeal cited the well-known
                        decision of the Indian Supreme Court in <em>Virsa Singh v
                            State of Punjab</em> [1958] SCR 1495 (“<em>Virsa Singh</em>”), and held that this s 300(c) inquiry is
                        an <em>objective</em> one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     While s 300(<em>b</em>)
                    invites a purely subjective inquiry, s 300(c) invites an inquiry which is one
                    part subjective (of the intention of causing bodily injury), and one part
                    objective (that the particular injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of
                    nature to cause death). In order for both ss 300(<em>b</em>) and 300(<em>c</em>) to fall within the ambit
                    of s 299, the interpretation of s 299 has to be wider than both. This
                    explains my view at [44] above that the second limb of s 299 encompasses a
                    subjective inquiry of the intention to cause a particular bodily injury, and an
                    objective inquiry that the particular injury is likely to cause death. The
                    learned authors of a local treatise on criminal law (Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan
                    and Chan Wing Cheong, <em>Criminal Law in Malaysia and
                        Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2012))
                    put it the following way (at para 9.62):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first and third limbs of s 299 (intention to kill and knowledge that
                        death is likely) are fully subjective but the second limb is not. As a
                        matter of interpretation, it cannot be necessary to prove that the accused
                        actually realised, or even considered the likely effects of the injuries
                        that were inflicted. If the ‘likelihood if death’ clause was to
                        be read in this way, the second limb of s 299 would become identical to s
                        300(b). The second limb of s 299 must therefore be partly subjective (the
                        prosecution must prove that the accused intended to cause a bodily injury)
                        and partly objective (it must be proved that such injury was likely to cause
                        death).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Nonetheless, there remains a subtle difference
                    between the second limb of s 299 and s 300(<em>c</em>),
                    which lies in the degree of probability that death would eventuate from the
                    injury caused (see <em>Rayavarapu Punnayya</em> at
                    607G–H). For the former, proof that the injury is “likely to cause
                    death” suffices. For the latter, it must be shown that the injury is
                    “sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
                    death”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     After assessing all the evidence adduced, I
                    was of the view that the charge had been made out. I begin with the <em>actus reus</em>, which the Prosecution identified as being
                    the “stabbing [of the deceased] on her neck with multiple knives”
                    (see [1] above). As set out above, the accused confessed to having inflicted
                    injuries 14 to 16, which “individually and collectively” caused
                    the death of the deceased, establishing the <em>actus
                        reus</em> (see [14], [27], and [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Turning to the <em>mens
                        rea</em>, it was also clear to me that the accused subjectively
                    intended to inflict the particular injuries in question. The accused had
                    deliberately retrieved the knives one after the other in order to stab the
                    deceased in the neck. This was particularly evident in the case of the second
                    and third injuries. After stabbing the deceased for the first time, the accused
                    walked away, returned to the kitchen to retrieve a knife before returning to
                    stab her in the throat one more time in order to prevent her from making a call
                    (see [14] above). Likewise, the third injury was also deliberate and
                    intentional. On this occasion, the accused admitted that he took another knife
                    to perform the act so that he would not be “attacked again” (see
                    [14] above), and to stop the deceased from questioning him (see [40(c)] above).
                    In the circumstances, I found that the accused intended to cause the injuries 14
                    to 16.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On the likelihood that death would be caused,
                    I noted that the injuries 14 to 16 had been assessed by Dr Paul to be,
                    “individually and collectively”, “sufficient to cause death
                    in the ordinary cause of nature” (see [28] above). I accepted the
                    evidence. This more than satisfied the <em>objective</em>
                    inquiry that the particular injuries were “likely to cause death”.
                    Though it is not necessary to do so, I would go further to state that it was an
                    irresistible inference that the accused <em>subjectively</em> knew that the injuries were likely to cause death.
                    This was obvious from the serious nature of the injuries and the locations where
                    the accused inflicted them. Further, as set out at [40(a)] above, the accused
                    knew that, left untreated, the deceased would probably die from the injury from
                    the first stab.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I should also state that given the position of
                    the accused that he was attacked by the deceased, I also considered whether the
                    accused could rely on the right of self-defence. After consideration, it was
                    clear to me that he could not. Section 100 of the Penal Code provides that there
                    is no right of private defence which extends to the causing of death unless a
                    person faces an assault which may reasonably cause the apprehension of death or
                    grievous hurt. The accused must establish this on a balance of probabilities.
                    Even taking the accused’s case at its highest and positing that the
                    deceased had attempted to harm him or outrage his modesty (which I did not
                    accept), those acts, either collectively or individually, would not give rise to
                    the right of private defence. Under cross-examination, the accused admitted as
                    much when he stated that he did not apprehend any threat to his life before he
                    stabbed the accused for the first and second times (see [40(a)] and [40(b)]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     For all of these reasons, I found that the
                    Prosecution had proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
                    Accordingly, I convicted the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For completeness, I would like to comment on
                    an aspect of the Prosecution’s case which somewhat troubled me. It seemed
                    to me that there was a disconnect between the way the charge was framed and the
                    way the Prosecution conducted their case. For one, in the course of
                    cross-examination, the Prosecution put to the accused that he was
                    “suffering from such abnormality of mind as substantially impaired [his]
                    mental responsibility”, and also pursued a line of questioning along the
                    same vein. The purpose appeared to be to raise the possibility that Exception 7
                    to s 300 of the Penal Code might apply (see [42] above). The problem with this
                    approach, however, is that Exception 7 would only be engaged if the Prosecution
                    had proved the offence of murder beyond reasonable doubt and the accused sought
                    to have it reduced to the lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to
                    murder. This was clearly inapplicable here because the charge, <em>as framed</em>, was not for the offence of murder to begin
                    with, but culpable homicide <em>simpliciter</em>.
                    Therefore, the Prosecution’s approach was incongruous with the charge. In
                    fact, the accused answered these questions in the negative, refusing to admit to
                    his mental condition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Furthermore, at para 43 of their closing
                    submissions, the Prosecution wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43

                                homicide</em> as enunciated in the decision of the Indian
                            Supreme Court in <em>Virsa Singh v State of
                                Punjab</em> AIR 1958 SC 465 … has been adopted and
                            applied by the Singapore courts, notably in the Court of Appeal case of
                                <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Poh Lye and
                                another</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 …

                            explanation by Bose J at [16] in <em>Virsa
                                Singh</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    The Prosecution must prove that the accused
                            subjectively intended to inflict the particular injury which was in fact
                            inflicted on the victim. <em>Such an injury must be
                                objectively assessed to be sufficient in the ordinary course of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As discussed above at [46(c)], both <em>Virsa Singh</em> and <em>Lim Poh
                        Lye</em> were concerned with the offence of <em>murder</em> as defined under s 300(<em>c</em>),
                    and not the offence of culpable homicide under the second limb of s 299.
                    The elements of the two offences are not coextensive. It was unhelpful for the
                    Prosecution to cite authorities which discuss s 300(<em>c)</em> in aid of the interpretation of the second limb of s 299
                    without explaining how the two provisions relate to each other. This can only
                    cause confusion, as was the case here when the Prosecution incorrectly submitted
                    that to prove the present charge under the second limb of s 299, objectively,
                    the injuries are “sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
                    death” rather than that the injuries are “likely to cause
                    death”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It seemed to me that the Prosecution was
                    trying to prove the more serious offence of murder under s 300(<em>c</em>), along with the application of Exception 7, so as to
                    discharge their burden of the less serious offence of culpable homicide under s
                    299. For good order, the Prosecution’s focus should have been to prove the
                    charge as they had framed it and to identify the correct test for the <em>mens rea</em> accordingly. That being said, there was
                    absolutely no prejudice whatsoever to the accused, and nothing material turned
                    on these points. With that, I now turn to discuss the sentencing of the
                    accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentencing principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Section 304(<em>a</em>)
                    of the Penal Code provides that whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting
                    to murder shall be punished either with imprisonment for life (and shall also be
                    liable to caning) <em>or</em> for imprisonment for a term
                    which may extend to twenty years (and shall also be liable to fine or to
                    caning).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Aniza bte Essa</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 327 (“<em>Aniza</em>”), the Court of Appeal held that the court is
                    justified in imposing a term of life imprisonment on mentally unstable offenders
                    for the sake of public protection where it is satisfied that the offenders will
                    pose a “serious danger to the public for an indeterminate time”
                    (see <em>Attorney-General’s Reference No 32 of 1996 (Steven
                        Alan Whittaker)</em> [1997] 1 Cr App R (S) 261 at 264 per Lord Bingham
                    CJ, cited in <em>Aniza</em> at [14]). For this purpose, the
                    Court of Appeal endorsed the use of the “<em>Hodgson</em> criteria”, a test first articulated by the
                    English Court of Appeal in the case of <em>R v Rowland Jack
                        Forster Hodgson</em> (1968) 52 Cr App R 113. The three limbs of this
                    test are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     The offence or offences are in
                        themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence (“<em>Hodgson</em> 1”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     It appears from the nature of the offences or
                        from the defendant’s history that he is a person of unstable character
                        likely to commit such offences in the future (“<em>Hodgson</em> 2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the offences are committed, the consequences to others
                        may be specially injurious (“<em>Hodgson</em>
                        3”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     From <em>Aniza</em> and
                    some of the cases which have applied the <em>Hodgson</em>
                    criteria, the following principles can be distilled:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     The dominant sentencing objective
                        underpinning the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria is public
                        protection (see <em>Aniza</em> at [12]). “The
                        purpose of the three conditions is <em>not to determine how
                            evil</em> a particular accused person can be. Rather, it is to
                        extrapolate from his condition and his actions, the likelihood of a relapse
                        and what the probable consequences might be” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Kwok Teng Soon</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 273 at
                        [29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                            <em>Hodgson</em> criteria are cumulatively
                        sufficient to justify the imposition of a life sentence on a mentally
                        unstable offender (see <em>Aniza</em> at [34]). They
                        provide a principled basis (public protection) for the imposition of the
                        maximum sentence of life imprisonment on a mentally unstable offender for
                        public protection (see <em>Aniza</em> at [34] and
                        [71(a)(i)]). It is, however, not applicable to normal offenders for whom the
                        usual test that the highest punishment should only be reserved for the worst
                        types of cases would still apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     The <em>Hodgson</em> criteria
                        provide a guide for distinguishing between mentally unstable offenders who
                        pose a long-term threat and therefore need to be incarcerated for life for
                        the sake of public protection and those who suffer from a transient illness
                        who should be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society when it is safe to
                        do so (see <em>Aniza</em> at [34] and [71(a)(ii)]). As
                        the Court of Appeal explained, “mentally unstable offenders who have
                        committed serious offences should only be kept in prison for as long as is
                        necessary for the protection of society (from the likelihood of recidivism),
                        but no longer” (see <em>Aniza</em> at
                        [2]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     In
                        applying <em>Hodgson</em> 2, there is no need to
                        demonstrate that the accused has a “high propensity” to commit
                        an identical offence. Instead, the court “need only be persuaded that
                        a likelihood of such future offences being committed exists … It
                        would suffice that the offences contemplated fall within the broad spectrum
                        of somewhat similar offences” (see <em>Public
                            Prosecutor v Chee Cheong Hin Constance</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 707
                            (“<em>Constance Chee</em>”) at
                        [7]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        criteria “justify” the imposition of a life sentence but they
                        do not mandate it. Satisfaction of the <em>Hodgson</em>
                        criteria does not invariably mean that a sentence of life imprisonment has
                        to be imposed (see <em>PP v Rohana</em> [2006] SGHC 52
                        at [12]). The court still has to examine the facts and circumstances in
                        their totality to determine what the appropriate sentence should be. This
                        proviso has to be read in light of the fact that the dominant sentencing
                        imperative in this area is public protection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s submissions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Prosecution relied on the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria and argued that these three criteria
                    had been fulfilled so as to justify the imposition of a sentence of life
                    imprisonment on the accused. They submitted that the offence was
                    “shocking, brutal and grisly” and that the consequences of the
                    commission of future similar offences would undoubtedly be very grave. They also
                    argued that the psychiatric evidence revealed that the accused has an
                    “unstable and unpredictable character”, and that he is likely to
                    commit such offences in the future. The accused shows no insight that he has a
                    serious mental illness. He is a dangerous and unpredictable individual who
                    committed a sudden and extreme act with little apparent warning, and he is an
                    intelligent offender who is able to disguise his mental illness. Taken in their
                    totality, they submitted that the best outcome would be for the accused to be
                    placed in a facility where his consumption of antipsychotic medication can be
                    supervised, observed and enforced where necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Further, the Prosecution submitted that there
                    were many aggravating factors and few mitigating factors. The accused had killed
                    his mother in a “brutal and merciless” manner and had attempted to
                    hide evidence of his deed after the fact, revealing his impenitence. While the
                    accused was relatively young, being 34 years old and a first-time offender,
                    these factors were of little mitigating value, given the severity of the offence
                    committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mitigation plea</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In his mitigation plea, the accused argued
                    that the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria had not been satisfied,
                    and that a sentence of life imprisonment should not be imposed on him. The
                    relevant extracts of what he said are set out as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I object to the prosecution’s submission for sentencing
                        with regard to what they have presented today, in light of that being of no
                        relevance to this case at hand. <em>All examples which they
                            have given show a lot of premeditation which is not present in this case
                            … So, in all three cases, there is a level there’s---a
                            level of premeditation which is not present in this case.</em> In
                        this case, the victim did attack me to an extent ... <em>So I
                            fail to see how this has satisfied the limb of the Hodgson
                            criteria.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, all three cases they have mentioned is---has stated that there
                        have---the victims---that their perpetrators have this, mainly is his veneer
                        of normality. …
                        <em>And the assessment conducted by IMH in the psychiatric
                            department, is er, barely half an hour to 40 minutes in a span of 2
                            years.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>And as far as medication goes, I have consistent in my
                            medication since 2008 both injection and orally.</em> And
                        medication is not cheap …
                        <em>So I fail to see how they have satisfied the limb of the
                            Hodgson criteria.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I agreed with the Prosecution that <em>Hodgson</em> 1 had been satisfied. This was a brutal act of
                    violence committed in a familial context, and should attract a very long
                    sentence. I accepted the accused’s contention that the offence was not
                    pre-meditated. However, even in the absence of pre-meditation, the offence was
                    still very grave and clearly satisfied <em>Hodgson</em> 1.
                    By the same token, it also seemed to me that <em>Hodgson</em> 3 had also been satisfied. If the accused were to commit
                    offences of like nature, the consequences to others would be specially
                    injurious. I therefore turned to <em>Hodgson</em>
                2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     
          <em>Hodgson</em> 2
                    requires a determination whether the accused is a person of an unstable
                    character likely to commit such offences in the future. In performing this
                    exercise, the court is required to extrapolate from the nature of the index
                    offence and the history of the accused whether the accused is a person who is of
                    unstable character and therefore likely to reoffend. This is ultimately
                    “an exercise in value judgment and common sense. It involves making a
                    considered judgment concerning the unknown future based on present known
                    facts” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Barokah</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 46 at [60]). In performing this exercise, the court will have regard
                    to the opinions of psychiatrists but the final assessment still rests with the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I begin with the accused’s clinical
                    history which, in my view, provided evidence that deterioration in the
                    accused’s mental state manifested itself in a propensity towards hostile
                    and violent behaviour. To recapitulate, the accused first presented to IMH in
                    2006 when he was reported as having “waved knives” at his uncle
                    (see [30] above). Similarly, in the months prior to being warded for the second
                    time in 2007, he had behaved in a “hostile” manner towards his
                    family members. What caused the most concern were the facts and circumstances
                    surrounding the commission of the offence. I agreed with Dr Koh that the offence
                    was “sudden, unexpected and extreme, [and committed] with little apparent
                    warning” (see [36] above). Even accepting the accused’s case at its
                    highest, there was little by way of provocation on the deceased’s part to
                    trigger his reaction. The sheer level of violence he displayed against his
                    mother, who had been his caregiver, was inexplicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It was clear to me that the offence had been
                    precipitated by a rapid decline in the accused’s mental state in the
                    months preceding its commission (see [32] above). In his psychiatric report, Dr
                    Koh assessed that at the material time, the accused’s decision-making
                    faculties were “significantly deranged from a normal state such that his
                    judgement, impulse control and planning abilities would have been severely
                    compromised” (see [33] above). The testimony of the accused at trial
                    supported this finding. When he was cross-examined on his motivation for the
                    first stab, he answered:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">All right, let’s just leave it at that. So,
                            she’s shorter than you at all points in time. And at this point in
                            time you were able to---you were trying to push her away. Now did you
                            believe that there was any grave threat to your life at this
                            point?</span></p>

                            not look good on anyone, and therefore you were of the view that
                            stabbing her on the neck was the best response?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">It is a spur of the moment thing, I did not plan the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>He responded in a similar vein when asked why he thought there
                        was a need to cut the deceased the third time, even after she had clearly

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I was not trying to decapitate her; I was trying to

                            to do at that time.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     A parallel can be drawn with the case of
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Hwang Yew Kong</em> [2006] SGHC
                    22 (“<em>Hwang Yew Kong</em>”). There, the
                    defendant suffered from residual schizophrenia. On the day of the offence, he
                    was in his bedroom watching television when he heard his father ask him whether
                    he had taken his money. The defendant lost his temper, picked up a knife and
                    proceeded to slash and stab his father, continuing to do so even after the
                    elderly man screamed for help and collapsed onto the floor. In assessing him to
                    be a highly dangerous individual, Tay Yong Kwang J wrote at [23] that it would
                    “be highly unrealistic” to say that he was not of unstable
                    character. While he presented “a picture of calm and normality when there
                    [was] nothing to provoke or upset him”, “<em>it
                        would not take very much to trigger off his explosive rage and turn him into
                        a maniacal and merciless killer</em>”. In his rage, “he
                    could turn brutally on someone who was very close to him and who had taken care
                    of him all his life. <em>His extremely violent reaction was
                        totally out of proportion to a relatively minor
                    accusation</em>” [emphases added]<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     From the facts as set out at [66] and [67]
                    above, I had no doubt that if the accused’s illness could not be
                    controlled, he would be an unstable, unpredictable and dangerous individual who
                    would remain a serious threat to himself and to those around him. Therefore, the
                    key question was whether his illness could be managed such that the risk to
                    public safety would recede to a level that would justify his release. After
                    careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances, I was not satisfied
                    that the accused’s illness could be sufficiently managed outside an
                    institutional setting, and that he would remain a danger to the public at large
                    for the foreseeable future. There were three inter-related points which weighed
                    heavily in favour of such a conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     First, I was concerned that, as reported by Dr
                    Koh, the accused did not show any insight into the fact that he has a mental
                    illness and of his need for treatment and medication. Prior to the offence, his
                    family members and psychiatrists harboured suspicions that he had been
                    defaulting on treatment. This problem was exacerbated by his refusal of depot
                    medication, which made it even more difficult for his caregivers to ensure that
                    he complied with his treatment regimen and took his medication regularly (see
                    [32] above). Contrary to the accused’s contention that he had been
                    compliant in taking his medication since 2008 (see [63] above), I had little
                    doubt that this tragic incident was due in part to the fact that he had not been
                    in full compliance with his treatment regimen in the months preceding the
                    offence. His lack of insight into his medical condition continued at trial, as
                    was borne out during cross-examination when he steadfastly denied that he
                    suffered from a mental illness at the material time:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Mohammad Zam bin Abdul Rashid</em> [2006] SGHC 168 (“<em>Mohammad Zam</em>”), the offender, pleaded guilty to a
                    charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He suffered from Frontal
                    Lobe Syndrome (“FLS”), which manifested in a significant
                    alternation of habitual patterns of behaviour and a loss of control over the
                    expression of emotions, needs, and impulses. The evidence was that FLS, while
                    irreversible, could still be managed with the aid of a strict treatment regimen
                    which would reduce the violent tendencies and improve the accused’s
                    impulse control. However, Tay Yong Kwang J held (at [35]) that he had “no
                    confidence at all in his [<em>ie</em>, the
                    offender’s] undertakings that he will comply with medication and continue
                    with treatment upon his release, bearing in mind his history and <em>despite the realisation that he is suffering from
                    FLS</em>” [emphasis added] and that he “very much doubt[ed]
                    that the [offender] will have the discipline to adhere to such a regime outside
                    the confines of incarceration” (at [39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Returning to the present facts, given the
                    accused’s refusal to fully acknowledge his mental illness and his previous
                    reluctance to comply with treatment, I had no doubt that left to his devices,
                    the accused would default on his treatment and medication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Second, the accused’s intelligence (as
                    evinced by the articulate responses during the trial) had served to assist him
                    in hiding his symptoms, even from professionals trained in the assessment of
                    psychiatric disorders (see [34] above). As observed by Dr Koh, in the years
                    leading up to the present offence, he had already demonstrated his capacity and
                    ability to conceal symptoms of his illness from those around him. This meant
                    that it would be extremely difficult for any treatment regimen to be enforced
                    unless he received close supervision and regular medical
                attention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Third, I noted that there was no evidence of
                    any post-release plan for the care of the accused. In cases involving
                    individuals with mental disorders, an important consideration is the presence of
                    strong familial and social structures for the enforcement of the prescribed
                    treatment regimen outside of a controlled environment such as that of a prison
                    (see <em>Mohammad Zam</em> and <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Lim Ah Liang</em> [2007] SGHC 34). In <em>Constance Chee</em>, the offender’s three sisters had each
                    sworn affidavits undertaking to assume responsibility for the offender’s
                    future medical care and supervision upon her release from incarceration. On the
                    strength of these undertakings, V K Rajah J (as he then was) held that the
                    offender’s illness could be adequately managed such that her propensity
                    for violence would sufficiently recede to the point which it could be said that
                    she would no longer be a real danger to the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Before me, there were no indications that
                    there would be anyone who would be able or willing to take care of the accused
                    upon his release, let alone provide any guarantees as those furnished in
                        <em>Constance Chee</em>. I was mindful of the fact that
                    prior to the offence, the accused had been cared for by the deceased and his
                    uncle, and that he lived with his siblings. The deceased is now gone and there
                    was no basis to believe that his uncle and siblings would be able or willing to
                    provide the requisite supervision and care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     From the foregoing, I reiterate my earlier
                    statement that if the accused’s illness cannot be controlled, he would
                    remain an unstable, unpredictable and dangerous individual, and pose a serious
                    threat to himself and to those around him. As Dr Koh opined, paranoid
                    schizophrenia is a condition that requires long term medication and treatment,
                    without which a relapse would be highly likely (see [35] above). Even with a
                    strict treatment plan, there is no guarantee, as Dr Koh has clarified, that the
                    accused’s condition would not worsen. I concluded that the likelihood of
                    recidivism existed, and that it would remain unless the accused remained in a
                    controlled environment in which his treatment and medication may be supervised
                    and enforced. The requirement set out in <em>Hodgson</em> 2
                    had thus been satisfied and the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria
                    had been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     At this juncture, it is appropriate to deal
                    with the matters put forth by the accused in his mitigation. It seemed to me
                    that the accused was making three points. First, the accused distinguished the
                    precedent cases cited by the Prosecution on the ground that the present offence
                    was not pre-meditated. Presumably, his contention was that the present offence
                    was not as serious or grave as those in the precedent cases and that,
                    consequently, he ought not to receive a sentence of life imprisonment. However,
                    as set out at [60(a)], the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria
                    provide an alternative to the principle that the highest punishment should only
                    be reserved for the worst types of cases. As indicated, the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria had been satisfied. Also, I have already
                    expressed my view that this was indeed a serious and grave
                offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Second, the accused seemed to challenge the
                    psychiatric evidence, especially regarding how one goes about assessing a person
                    who appears normal to be of an unstable character. In particular, the accused
                    said that the psychiatric reports were merely based on short interviews over the
                    two years (see [63] above). I rejected this argument. The psychiatric reports
                    were based on interviews with the accused, previous medical records with IMH,
                    interviews with the family members and observations made by the medical officers
                    who attended to the accused while in remand. I found the psychiatric evidence
                    credible. Further, I did not rely on the conclusions of Dr Koh uncritically but
                    also checked to see that they supported by the accused’s testimony in
                    court (see [67], [70] and [73]) before arriving at the conclusion that the
                    accused was a person of unstable character who would be likely to commit similar
                    offences in the future if treatment were not enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Third, the accused submitted that since 2008,
                    he has been compliant with his treatment and medication. As set out at [70], I
                    did not accept this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In my judgment, based on the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria, a sentence of life imprisonment was
                    justified. Having reviewed all the other facts and circumstances, including
                    matters stated by the accused, I found no other considerations that militated
                    against the imposition of such a sentence. Accordingly, I so ordered. Following
                    the lead of Tay J in <em>Hwang Yew Kong</em> at [20], I did
                    not think that caning was warranted given the accused’s mental condition.
                    I therefore made no order for caning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     This has been a terrible tragedy for the
                    family. It has taken away the life of the deceased and has resulted in the
                    incarceration of the accused. For Daniel, Sunil and Sheena who witnessed the
                    immediate aftermath of the offence, the toll this has exacted on their lives
                    must be tremendous. One can only hope that with time, there will be some measure
                    of closure and healing.</p>
