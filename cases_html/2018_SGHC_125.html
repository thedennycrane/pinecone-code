Following the success of the school’s rope skipping team in competitions, the Victim was invited by the Accused to join a private rope skipping team that the Accused had helped to start (“the private rope skipping team”). Training for the private rope skipping team took place at a studio run by the Accused. As a member of the private rope skipping team, the Victim took part in a number of competitions in 2007 to 2010. The association of the Victim and the Accused continued into the Victim’s enrolment in secondary school in 2008.

</div> At trial, the admissibility of the second statement recorded from the Accused on 21 May 2014 at 11.47am (“the Statement”) was challenged by the Defence on the basis that it was not made voluntarily. The Accused alleged that he was threatened by the investigation officer, Deputy Superintendent (then Assistant Superintendent) Mohamed Razif s/o Abdul Majid (“DSP Razif”). The Accused also alleged that he was subjected to oppressive conditions which rendered the Statement involuntary because of the way he was treated at the lock-up after he was arrested.

Prior to the interviews, Dr Raja explained to the Accused that the consultations were not protected by the usual doctor-patient confidentiality, and that the information that was conveyed during the interview could be accessed by the court and used in court proceedings.

Mr T then referred her to the school counsellor (“Ms C”). Mr T and Ms C eventually accompanied the Victim to lodge a police report on 28 April 2014.

The Victim had willingly gone to the Accused’s flat, without any threat being made, and left for training as per normal after having had sex. All of these were said to be wholly incongruous. In addition, no couch or evidence that there had been a couch in the balcony of the Accused’s flat were recovered in the course of investigations.

</div> gave me some pause. I did not find however that the Victim’s testimony was to be rejected because of any inherent improbabilities.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I accepted that victims of sexual offences may not behave in a stereotypical way. Many victims report their sexual abuse early to a family member, friend, the police, or other person in authority. However, there is no general rule requiring victims of sexual offences to report the offences immediately or in a timely fashion. Instead, the explanation for any such delay in reporting is to be considered and assessed by the court on a case-by-case basis (see <span class="font-italic">DT v Public Prosecutor</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 583 at [62]; <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Seng v Public Prosecutor</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 444 at [79]). While I accept that an omission to report the offence in a timely fashion, in the absence of other evidence, may in certain circumstances make it difficult to establish a case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, I emphasise that the effect of any delay in reporting always falls to be assessed on the specific facts of each individual case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Victim’s behaviour in the present case in continuing with her rope skipping training with the Accused until 2010 may at first blush seem odd given that she was the victim of repeated sexual abuse. So was the fact that after one instance of sexual intercourse, she went on to go for training as per normal.

</div> However, all this must be seen in the light of the fact that the Victim was at the material time a child of just 13 years, for whom training and competing with the Accused’s private rope skipping team was the centrepiece of her life and, indeed, her aspirations for the future.

</div> While the average adult may be expected to react in a particular way – for example, to resist, report or complain about an assault as soon as possible – a child or juvenile cannot be expected to always react similarly. The thinking process, assumptions and viewpoint of a child or juvenile victim may lead to a course of action that may on its face appear unreasonable or improbable to an adult. However, the court must always be mindful of the reasons behind what may seem like unexpected conduct on the part of a child or juvenile victim, and should not measure a child or juvenile by adult standards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 What the court should do is to assess, given the evidence in respect of the specific complainant and the allegations made, whether what is put forward is consonant with the likely probabilities. A child or juvenile complainant may not be expected to complain if he or she feels vulnerable, or is otherwise focussed on matters other than protecting his or her modesty. A child or juvenile is by definition immature, and should not, in the absence of evidence showing otherwise, be held to the measure of an adult. The thought processes and concerns of a child or juvenile may also continue to evolve and permutate as he or she matures, such that it may be some time before he or she is in a position to complain.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Thus, in the present case, the fact that the Victim did not complain in a timely manner and remained in contact with the Accused over the extended duration of the abuse did not rob her of credibility; I accepted that the Victim was focussed on her continued participation in the private rope skipping team, and did not know what to do about the Accused’s sexual advances. I accepted her explanation that she did not resist or report the offences to a teacher or family member as rope skipping was her priority at that time and she feared that her place on the private rope skipping team would be jeopardised were she to do so. I also accepted that she had not reported the offences to her family or the police as she felt ashamed.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Similarly, the fact that the Victim was not driven into despair or helplessness was not by itself a ground for disbelief of her evidence. People react in different ways to sexual abuse and may compartmentalise or rationalise their reactions. A calm, undisturbed disposition may generally incline the court to conclude that no wrong was committed, but it is not necessary for a complainant to be distraught for her to be believed.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether evidence is unusually convincing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 If the complainant’s evidence is accepted, the next question is then whether the complainant’s evidence in itself is sufficient to convict the accused person of the charges. The complainant’s evidence must be unusually convincing to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration, in order for the accused to be convicted of the offence based on the complainant’s testimony alone (see <span class="font-italic">AOF v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]; <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</span> [2016] 5 SLR 636 at [27]–[30]; <span class="font-italic">XP v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at [31]). In some cases, the complainant’s evidence is unusually convincing. In other instances, the complainant’s evidence is insufficient on its own to bring the case over the threshold. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [115], in determining if a complainant’s testimony is unusually convincing, the demeanour of the witness is to be weighed alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’s testimony. Ultimately, the sufficiency of the complainant’s testimony to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt is to be considered, which is an inquiry that is both factual and one which is a question of judgment on the part of the trial judge (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [39]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Here, the Victim’s testimony was, on the whole, believable and credible; she maintained her version of events in cross-examination, and I did not find that her evidence was to be doubted in the circumstances, particularly considering the passage of time. Any inconsistency between the Victim’s testimony at trial and the first information report concerning the timeline of events was minor and not material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, the word “unusually” in the “unusually convincing” standard implies that it is not sufficient for the complainant’s testimony to be merely convincing and there must be something more in the testimony to bring it over the threshold. In this case, the credibility which could be given to the Victim’s testimony was not sufficient on its own to lead to the conclusion that the case was proven against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The gap of time was significant and this raised the possibility of fabrication or at least incorrect recollection. The Victim’s evidence alone was not to my mind unusually convincing and sufficient on its own to convict the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 While the Victim’s testimony was not <span class="font-italic">unusually</span> convincing such that it was sufficient on its own to prove the case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt, I did not find that the Victim was being untruthful or that she was not a credible witness. The Victim’s testimony was not to my mind wholly unconvincing as submitted by the Defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Defence argued that there were significant shortfalls in the evidence of the Victim which made her evidence unconvincing, including:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to the 15th charge, it was unbelievable that the Victim would have dared to insert a vibrator into the Victim’s vagina in an all- girls school during an afternoon training session.

</div> In addition, according to the Defence, in order for the Prosecution to make a negative assertion that there was a lack of motive on the part of the Victim to make fabrications of sexual assault against the Accused, the burden fell on the Prosecution to adduce credible evidence to this effect. The Defence thus argued that it did not bear the burden of proving that the Victim had some reason to make false allegations against the Accused.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It is useful at this juncture to consider the case law cited by the parties. In <span class="font-italic">Khoo</span><span class="font-italic"> Kwoon Hain v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591, Yong Pung How CJ held at [71] that the burden of proving a lack of motive to falsely implicate the accused is on the Prosecution, and that reliance on the complainant’s word that he or she had no reason to falsely implicate the accused was not a ground to believe the complainant’s testimony due to the circularity of such reasoning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In <span class="font-italic">Goh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 374, Yong Pung How CJ however clarified that while the burden to prove absence of motive laid on the Prosecution, such burden would only arise where the accused was able to show that the complainant had a motive to falsely implicate him. Yong Pung How CJ stated at [33] of the decision: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]here the accused can show that the complainant has a motive to falsely implicate him, then the burden must fall on the Prosecution to disprove that motive. This does not mean that the accused merely needs to allege that the complainant has a motive to falsely implicate him. Instead, the accused must adduce sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. Only then would the burden of proof shift to the Prosecution to prove that there was no such motive. To hold otherwise would mean that the Prosecution would have the burden of proving a lack of motive to falsely implicate the accused in literally every case, thereby practically instilling a lack of such a motive as a constituent element of every offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further, in <span class="font-italic">Loo See Mei v Public Prosecutor</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 27, Yong Pung How CJ reiterated at [41] that the Prosecution’s burden in proving that there was a lack of motive to fabricate was one of “beyond reasonable doubt” not “beyond all doubt”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Thus in my judgment, the above line of cases establishes that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The burden of proving the absence of motive on the part of the complainant to concoct fabrications against the accused lies on the Prosecution. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, the burden on the Prosecution to prove absence of motive to fabricate does not arise in every instance. Such burden only arises where the defence raises sufficient evidence of a motive to fabricate so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the defence raises sufficient evidence of a motive to fabricate, the Prosecution had to prove that that there was no such motive. The following principles should be borne in mind in assessing if the Prosecution has discharged its burden:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Reliance on the complainant’s word that he or she had no reason to falsely implicate the accused is insufficient to prove that there was no such motive due to the circularity of such reasoning. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii)  The Prosecution has to prove that that there was no such motive beyond a reasonable doubt and not beyond all doubt. Thus, raising frivolous conjectures on the possible motives of the complainant would be insufficient to lead to a finding that the Prosecution has failed to discharge its burden. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Applying these principles to the facts in the present case, as the Defence did not raise evidence of any motive on the part of the Victim to make false allegations against the Accused, the burden on the Prosecution to disprove such motive did not arise. There was no evidence adduced to show that there was any such motive to fabricate on the part of the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 However, while the presence of motive to fabricate may raise reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused person under the charges, that there is an absence of motive is not sufficient for the case against the accused to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, the fact that there was no evidence of any motive or reason for the Victim to mount fabrications against the Accused in this case was not sufficient on its own to render the Victim’s testimony unusually convincing and correspondingly sufficient to prove the case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Nevertheless, in the present case, the Victim’s testimony was not the only evidence against the Accused and therefore my finding that the Victim’s testimony was not unusually convincing was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Statement of the Accused</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The voluntariness of the Statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The voluntariness of the Statement was challenged by the Accused. Having heard the parties at the ancillary hearing, I found against the Accused and admitted the Statement. I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that DSP Razif had not made a threat to the Accused in the manner alleged and that no threat operated on the mind of the Accused in giving the Statement. The conditions of the Accused’s detention, while uncomfortable, also did not result in oppression, or in other words, the sapping of the Accused’s will.

From the photographs and other evidence, while the conditions in the THA were sparse, bordering perhaps on spartan, they were not to my mind such as to lead to oppression.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I did have some concerns about aspects of the Prosecution’s evidence on the above matters concerning the events on 21 May 2014 when the Accused was brought from the Police Cantonment Complex to his home for a search, though this did not affect my finding on the voluntariness of the Statement. Evidence was given of standard procedures and what would be done usually. While standard operating procedures and protocols could be relevant, the simple fact of the matter was that these may not have been complied with for various reasons. Where facts in issue occurred years before trial, evidence that such protocols or standard operating procedures were in place and must necessarily have been followed is usually not persuasive without records or other documentary evidence to substantiate compliance. The recollection of the individual officers that the standard operating procedures would have been complied with at that time would generally have little weight. The officers involved would have been involved in many cases and unless they are able to recollect specifically what happened and give some explanation of why that particular recollection stuck in their memory, little weight can be given to such recollection of compliance. In contrast, the events would be expected to leave a comparatively more striking memory in accused persons and their families, except perhaps in respect of jaded repeat offenders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I did not find however that any of these differences affected the voluntariness of the Statement; they were not material to the issue.

</div> would have been on the credibility of the police witnesses and not directly on the issue of whether the Accused was subject to oppressive conditions or a threat. As it was, even if I found in favour of the Accused on the aspects highlighted above at [64], it would not have undermined the evidence of DSP Razif and the other police witnesses. The Defence’s case was that a threat was made by DSP Razif at the Police Cantonment Complex shortly after the recording of the first statement on 20 May 2014, and not that there was a threat made at any point when the Accused was brought back to his home subsequently on 21 May 2014. Any shortcoming in the evidence of the police officers was not of such a scale as to affect their credibility generally. Any error would have been attributable to gaps in recollections that were understandable due to the passage of time.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Failure to inform the Accused of right to remain silent </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In its closing submissions, the Defence made arguments on DSP Razif’s failure to inform the Accused of his right to remain silent prior to the taking of the Statement. The case law is clear that a person need not be expressly informed of his right under s 22(2) of the CPC to remain silent, and that the failure of the recording officer to administer a caution to the accused person in terms of s 22(2) before the statement was recorded does not render a statement inadmissible (see <span class="font-italic">Mazlan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Thian Lai </span>at [17]–[18]).

That these cases were concerned with the right to remain silent which was at the relevant time contained in s 121(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), and not strictly speaking what is now s 22(2) of the CPC, was not material. In any event, with respect, the position laid down in the Court of Appeal decisions comports with the language and purpose of s 258, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the admissibility provision of the CPC.

For instance, that the events giving rise to the 21st and 22nd charges took place sometime in March 2009 when the Accused’s wife and two eldest daughters were overseas was supported by travel records from the ICA. These records showed that the Victim (save for a single day-trip to Malaysia on 15 March 2009) and Accused had been in Singapore throughout March 2009, while the Accused’s wife and two eldest daughters were overseas from 20 March 2009 to 2 April 2009.

It is not obliged to act for the Defence. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Thus, the court may only draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for not calling a witness where certain conditions are met. In <span class="font-italic">Khua</span><span class="font-italic"> Kian Keong and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 526, Yong Pung How CJ outlined the relevant conditions at [34] as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The witness not offered was a material one; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  The Prosecution was withholding evidence which it possessed and which was available; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) This was done with an ulterior motive to hinder or hamper the Defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my judgment, these conditions are equally applicable in determining if an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution under s 116, illustration (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Evidence Act for the non-adducing of documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 For the reasons set out in the following paragraphs, I found that the Victim’s psychiatric report and the Victim’s document were not material and that the Prosecution’s decision not to adduce these documents was not taken with an ulterior motive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 While the burden was on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Prosecution should call witnesses or adduce other evidence to make this out, an adverse inference should only be drawn against a party where some explanation is called for from that party for the omission, in the light of the materiality of the evidence. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Sudha</span><span class="font-italic"> Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd</span> [2017] 1 SLR 141 at [20] (in the context of a civil case), there must be some evidence, even if weak, adduced by the party seeking to draw the inference on the issue in question before the court is entitled to draw an adverse inference, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there must be a case to answer on that issue which is then strengthened by drawing the inference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Here, in respect of the psychiatric disposition of the Victim, it was not actually put to the Victim by the Defence that she had made allegations against the Accused because of some delusion or other psychiatric illness. Neither was there anything in the Victim’s evidence that would have attracted some suspicion that she was delusional. Given that it was not part of the Defence’s case that the Victim was delusional, it would not be appropriate for an adverse inference to be drawn for the non-adducing of the Victim’s psychiatric report. Furthermore, unless the subject matter underlying the drawing of the adverse inference (in this case, the Victim’s state of mind) touches on an element of the charge itself, any adverse inference should be drawn only where at least the evidential burden of proving that subject matter falls on the party against whom that inference is to be drawn. In this case, the Defence did not run a case challenging the psychiatric state of the Victim and the psychiatric state of the Victim was therefore not in issue. Thus, the Prosecution did not have a burden to adduce evidence on the Victim’s state of mind in order to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the Victim was not delusional. No adverse inference could be drawn from the fact that the Prosecution did not do so.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Similarly, no adverse inference was drawn for the Prosecution’s omission to adduce the Victim’s document containing an account of the sexual offences committed by the Accused. This was a document created some time after the incidents, after the Victim had confided in her relative from the US in 2014 who had advised her to record down the incidents.

</div> It was not a contemporaneous document and was thus not material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I should add that the non-calling of two former boyfriends of the Victim and her relative to whom she eventually confided in regarding the events was again immaterial. The inference to be drawn from the non-calling of the witnesses would presumably be that they would contradict her, or undermine her evidence in some way. But there was no indication of this – the absence of their testimony only deprived her of the additional support that she could have perhaps obtained, and even then any such additional support would have been of a low level given that they had heard what she recounted sometime after the events. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I should also note that the fact that the first information report or any police report may not be detailed would not necessarily be a ground for disbelief of the Victim’s testimony. As the court stated in <span class="font-italic">Tan Pin Seng</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 494<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [27], the first information report or police report is not meant to contain the entire case for the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Findings on guilt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Statement and the psychiatric report and case notes of Dr Raja disclosed that the Accused considered himself to be in a relationship with the Victim, and that he had committed various acts outlined in the charges, namely sexual penetration of the Victim’s vagina with his finger, a vibrator, and a skipping rope handle, oral sex as well as actual sexual intercourse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Taken together with the Victim’s testimony, there was sufficient evidence to make out the elements of each of the seven charges, and such evidence precluded any reasonable doubt. The Accused’s evidence at trial, which was a denial, could not sufficiently explain away both the Victim’s evidence as well as the Accused’s own Statement, and the psychiatric report and case notes of Dr Raja, and could not overcome the cumulative weight of these three sources of evidence. I rejected the Accused’s defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that of denial of the said acts, as being against the cumulative weight of all the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I also accepted the Victim’s testimony of the timeline of the events which was corroborated by other evidence. I found therefore that the Victim was below 14 years of age at the material time of all seven charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I did not accept however the version of facts recounted by the Accused in his Statement and to Dr Raja that appeared to portray the behaviour of the Victim as being provocative. This was in my judgment against the probabilities of the situation. There was an absence of any other evidence that suggested that there was anything of the nature of an affectionate relationship between them, as would seem to be the tenor of the Statement and version of events recounted by the Accused to Dr Raja. I accepted the evidence of the Victim that the sexual acts were committed through what was at least cajoling, if not pressure, by the Accused. In any event, consent of the Victim is irrelevant to the establishment of culpability of the Accused for the offences proceeded with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The evidence that I accepted established that the Accused did commit the offences contained in the charges, namely:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The 7th charge: One count of penetrating the Victim's vagina with his finger, an offence punishable under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 376A(3) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The 11th charge: One count of penetrating the Victim’s vagina with the handle of a skipping rope, an offence punishable under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 376A(3) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) The 15th charge: One count of penetrating the Victim’s vagina with a vibrator, an offence punishable under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 376A(3) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) The 21st and 25th charges: Two counts of penetrating the Victim’s mouth with his penis, which are offences punishable under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 376A(3) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) The 22nd and 26th charges: Two counts of statutory rape, which are offences punishable under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 375(2) of the Penal Code. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I was satisfied that the charges were established beyond a reasonable doubt.

Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of<span class="font-italic"> </span>sentences which may <span class="font-italic">usually </span>be imposed for an offence with those<span class="font-italic"> </span>features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely<span class="font-italic"> </span>where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an<span class="font-italic"> </span>“indicative starting point”. In exceptional cases, the court may decide<span class="font-italic"> </span>on an indicative starting point which falls outside the prescribed range, although cogent reasons should be given for such a decision. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The sentencing bands prescribe ranges of sentences which would be appropriate for contested cases and are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Band 1 comprises cases at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness which attract sentences of ten to 13 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Such cases feature no offence-specific aggravating factors or are cases where these factors are only present to a very limited extent and therefore have a limited impact on sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Band 2 comprises cases of rape of a higher level of seriousness which attract sentences of 13–17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Such cases would usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors (such as those listed at [44] above).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) Band 3 comprises cases which, by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors, present themselves as extremely serious cases of rape. They should attract sentences of between 17–20 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are <span class="font-italic">personal to the offender</span> to calibrate the sentence. These are factors which relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, <span class="font-italic">cannot </span>be the same factors which have already been taken into account in determining the categorisation of the offence. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The court should clearly articulate the factors it has taken into consideration as well as the weight which it is placing on them. This applies <span class="font-italic">both </span>at the second step of the analysis, when the court is calibrating the sentence from the indicative starting point <span class="font-italic">and </span>at the end of the sentencing process, when the court adjusts the sentence on account of the totality principle. In this regard, we would add one further caveat. In a case where the offender faces two or more charges, and the court is required to order one or more sentences to run consecutively, the court can, if it thinks it necessary, further calibrate the individual sentence to ensure that the global sentence is appropriate and not excessive. When it does so, the court should explain itself so that the individual sentence imposed will not be misunderstood.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As the Accused was above the age of 50, pursuant to s 325(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC, he could not be sentenced to caning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I accepted that the operating offence-specific aggravating factors in the present case were abuse of position, premeditation, rape of a vulnerable victim, and non-use of condom and brought the case within Band 2 of the sentencing framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 There was abuse of position.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In the light of the nature of the relationship between the Accused and the Victim, the Accused having been a coach of the Victim, there was abuse of position. As a coach of the Victim, he was a teacher and mentor of the Victim whom the Victim looked to to improve her skills in rope skipping, a sport which she was very passionate about. The Accused had instead exploited his position of responsibility towards the Victim in carrying out the heinous act of statutory rape of the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The Victim, being a student of the Accused and below the age of 14 at the relevant time of the rape offences, was a vulnerable victim whom the Accused had preyed on and this was clearly another aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 There was also premeditation on the part of the Accused. Predatory behaviour such as the grooming of a child or young person is an example of premeditation, as recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> (at [44(c)]). In this case, the offences were premeditated by the Accused as he had, amongst others, sexually groomed the Victim by taking nude photos of her and then escalated his acts to sexual penetration with objects, and then rape of the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I was also of the view that the fact that the Accused did not use a condom, thus exposing the Victim to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, was also an aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The only offender-specific mitigating factors operating here were the advanced age of the Accused and the absence of any prior antecedents. The mitigating value of these factors was low. In relation to the absence of prior antecedents, it is well established that little mitigating weight can be given to the offender’s previous good behaviour or lack of antecedents where serious offences are concerned (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v UI </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (“<span class="font-italic">UI</span>”) at [69]). The advanced age of the Accused was also of little mitigating value as explained in a separate section below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Having taken into account the offence-specific and offender-specific mitigating and aggravating factors, I was satisfied that a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment was appropriate for the 22nd and 26th charges which were the charges of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 375(2) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appropriate sentence for the sexual penetration charges </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BAB </span>[2017] 1 SLR 292 (“<span class="font-italic">BAB</span>”), the Court of Appeal set out the following sentencing starting points for a s 376A offence of sexual penetration of a minor under 16 as follows (at [65]): </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) For offences punishable under s 376A(2), where there is an element of abuse of trust, the starting point will be a term of imprisonment of three years.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) For offences punishable under s 376A(3) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the victim was below the age of 14), where there is an element of abuse of trust, the starting point will be a term of imprisonment of between ten and 12 years. It should also be borne in mind that s 376A(3), unlike s 376A(2) provides for caning as well. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>”), the Court of Appeal set out the following sentencing bands for digital penetration, an offence punishable under s 376 of the Penal Code as follows (at [159]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Band 1: seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Band 2: ten to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Band 3: 15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The Court of Appeal explained further at [160] of <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> that in formulating these sentencing bands, it had been conscious that where the offence of sexual penetration discloses any of the two statutory aggravating factors in s 376(4) of the Penal Code, there is a prescribed minimum sentence of eight years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, and that these cases should fall within Band 2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The Court of Appeal in<span class="font-italic"> Pram Nair</span> also considered that the sentencing bands it had prescribed for s 376 may have an impact on the appropriate sentencing bands for s 376A offences. In particular, the Court of Appeal stated (at [161]–[164]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">161 We have also been conscious of the possible relevance of these proposed bands to s 376A of the Penal Code, which criminalises the sexual penetration of a minor under the age of 16, regardless of whether the minor consented. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">162 Sections 376 and 376A of the Penal Code have a lot in common and overlap in scope in some situations. The two main differences are that the latter section deals with sexual penetration offences against minors under 16 years of age, for which the consent of the minor is irrelevant. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">163 In the light of what we have set out at [159], the starting point of three years’ imprisonment for a s 376A(2) offence in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> may now look rather lenient when compared to the seven to ten years’ imprisonment range in Band 1 for a s 376 offence. However, it must be remembered that s 376A(2) prescribes a maximum sentencing range of ten years or fine or both (with no caning) whereas s 376(3), the applicable provision in this appeal, provides for a maximum punishment of 20 years’ imprisonment and a liability to fine or to caning. Bearing that in mind, the question of whether the starting point of [three] years’ imprisonment for s 376A(2) cases proposed in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> should be tweaked, and if so how, will have to be addressed on another occasion.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">164 On the other hand, it is clear that the starting point of between ten and 12 years’ imprisonment for s 376A(3) offences (involving victims below 14 years in age) may need to be reviewed in the light of what we have said at [159] and [160] above because this subsection has the same sentencing range as s 376(3), that is, a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years and liability to fine or to caning. In a future case involving digital penetration of the vagina which falls within s 376A(3), the court will have to decide on the appropriate sentence after considering what we have set out at [159] and [160] above. In addition, we must also note one other difference: unlike s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), there is no minimum imprisonment term and no mandatory caning in s 376A(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Thus, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> noted that while the starting point of three years’ imprisonment for a s 376A(2) offence as stated in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> appeared lenient when compared to the seven to ten years’ imprisonment range that it had set for Band 1 of a s 376 offence, it had to be borne in mind that s 376A(2) prescribes a maximum sentencing range of ten years or fine or both (with no caning) while s 376(3) provides for a maximum punishment of 20 years’ imprisonment and a liability to fine or to caning. In other words, the prescribed statutory sentencing ranges for s 376(3) and s 376A(2) were different. Therefore, there may not necessarily be a need to reconsider the starting points proposed in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> for a s 376A(2) offence in the light of the sentencing ranges prescribed for s 376. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In comparison, in respect of s 376A(3), which is the applicable provision in the present case, the same sentencing range applies as under s 376(3), that is, a maximum imprisonment term of 20 years and liability to fine or to caning. Therefore, according to the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, it was clear that the starting point set out in <span class="font-italic">BAB </span>of between ten and 12 years’ imprisonment for a s 376A(3) offence may need to be reviewed in the light of the sentencing bands that it had prescribed for a s 376 offence (as reproduced at [111] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I thus read <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> as not requiring a more lenient treatment <span class="font-italic">per se</span> under s 376A(3) as compared to s 376, and if anything indicating that a similar approach with regard to the sentencing bands, with some modification, would apply to offences under s 376A(3) as that under s 376. The sentencing bands for s 376A(3) though would need to take into account that unlike in s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), there is no minimum imprisonment term and no mandatory caning in s 376A(3). In this regard, the sentencing bands for s 376A(3) may vary slightly from the sentencing bands for s 376. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Thus, based on the sentencing bands prescribed in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> for an offence under s 376, including seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane for Band 1 (see above at [111]), the starting point of the sentence for a s 376A(3) offence should no longer be ten to 12 years as prescribed in <span class="font-italic">BAB</span> and should instead be shorter than that. Due to the need for the sentencing bands for s 376A(3) to vary slightly from the sentencing bands for s 376 for the reason stated above at [116], I was satisfied that Band 2 for a s 376A(3) offence may start at lower than ten years, and may indeed be as low as eight or nine years.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The Prosecution submitted that an imprisonment term of nine years would be appropriate in respect of each of the s 376A(3) charges. I was of the view however that given the presence of the aggravating factors explained above, including the abuse of position, premeditation and vulnerability of the Victim which applied to the sexual penetration charges as well, the present case fell closer to the middle of Band 2.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including both the offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence for each of the sexual penetration charges under s 376A(3) of the Penal Code was 11 years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Age of the Accused </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In determining that the appropriate sentences for each of the sexual penetration charges and rape charges were 11 years’ and 14 years’ imprisonment respectively, I had considered the advanced age of the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In <span class="font-italic">UI</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal stated (at [78]) in relation to the relevance of the advanced age of the accused person in sentencing that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n general, the mature age of the offender does not warrant a moderation of the punishment to be meted out (see <span class="font-italic">Krishan</span><span class="font-italic"> Chand v PP</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 737 at [8]). But, where the sentence is a long term of imprisonment, the offender’s age is a relevant factor as, unless the Legislature has prescribed a life sentence for the offence, the court should not impose a sentence that effectively amounts to a life sentence. Such a sentence would be regarded as crushing and would breach the totality principle of sentencing. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In my judgment, while a court should generally avoid imposing a sentence that effectively operates as a life sentence, this is not to my mind an absolute rule, and must be measured against the criminal conduct of the accused in the case in question, and the presence or absence of other aggravating and mitigating factors. Where the offences committed are heinous, as they are here, it may be that a long sentence would need to be imposed even on a relatively older accused person, and that in the Accused’s circumstances, it may possibly operate to leave him in prison for the remainder of his expected life (though taking into account remission for good behaviour this may not necessarily be the case). The sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution have to be given precedence in such cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I did not understand <span class="font-italic">UI </span>as precluding me from coming to this conclusion or as standing for the position that a departure from sentencing precedents and benchmarks is always warranted where the accused person is of an advanced age, in order to guarantee that the sentence will not leave the accused person in prison for the remainder of his or her life. The advanced age of the accused person does not automatically preclude the imposition of a long sentence which may leave the accused person in prison for the remainder of his or her life. Rather, this is only one relevant factor that has to be considered against all the circumstances of the case, including the operating sentencing principles and precedents, as well as the mitigating and aggravating factors in the case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Running of sentences </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As for the running of the sentences, I accepted that it was sufficient for one charge of statutory rape and one charge of sexual penetration to run consecutively, taking into account the principles of proportionality and totality. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Therefore, the sentences imposed were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 22nd and 26th charges: 14 years’ imprisonment each</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 7th, 11th, 15th, 21st and 25th charges: 11 years’ imprisonment each</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The sentences in the 22nd and 11th charges were to run consecutively, with the rest running concurrently, giving a global sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In conclusion, I convicted the Accused of the charges proceeded with at trial, namely the 7th, 11th, 15th, 21st, 22nd, 25th and 26th charges, as I was satisfied that the charges had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Based on the applicable sentencing principles, I sentenced the Accused to a global imprisonment term of 25 years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Winston Man &amp; Nicholas Lai <br/>(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Peter Keith Fernando (Leo Fernando) <br/>for the Accused.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
