<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The proceedings that led to this appeal arose
                    out of a road accident involving Mr Chai Kang Wei Samuel (“the
                    Appellant”) and Ms Linda Gillian Shaw (“the Respondent”).
                    The Appellant did not contest his liability for the injuries the Respondent
                    suffered as a result of the accident, and interlocutory judgment was entered in
                    favour of the Respondent at an early stage of the proceedings. What remained to
                    be determined was the appropriate quantum of damages to be awarded to the
                    Respondent for the injuries she had sustained. The assistant registrar who
                    presided over the assessment of damages proceedings (“the AR”)
                    made his award on 26 March 2009. Dissatisfied with the AR’s decision,
                    both parties appealed. The High Court judge (“the Judge”), who
                    heard the appeals, allowed both appeals in part. Dissatisfied with the
                    Judge’s decision, the Appellant appealed to this court. We heard the
                    appeal on 3 February 2010 and allowed the appeal in part. We now give the
                    reasons for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The accident in question occurred on
                    6 December 2003 at about 12.44am at the junction of Paterson Road and
                    Orchard Road. The Appellant had lost control of the car which he was driving. It
                    mounted the pavement and collided with a number of people, including the
                    Respondent who was waiting at the pavement to cross the road. The Respondent, an
                    Australian national aged 26 at that time, was then on vacation in Singapore. On
                    1 July 2004, the Appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving
                    (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Chai Kang Wei Samuel</em>
                    [2004] SGDC 198). On 15 November 2006, interlocutory judgment for
                    full liability was entered by consent against the Appellant, with damages to be
                    assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As a result of the accident, the Respondent
                    sustained a fracture at the base of her skull which resulted in traumatic brain
                    injury. This, in turn, caused, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    muscular weakness on the right side of her body, weakness in her tongue and
                    throat muscles, vocal cord paralysis, amnesia, and cognitive impairments. Other
                    injuries suffered by the Respondent included:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">right leg, metatarsal and cuboid bones
                            fractures;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">severe degloving of the right foot and lateral
                            ankle; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">multiple bruises, abrasions and
                        haematoma.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The extensiveness of the Respondent’s injuries caused her to be
                    on medical leave from 6 December 2003 to 28 February 2006 – this
                    being a total of 816 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Prior to the accident, the Respondent worked as
                    a full-time physiotherapist at Adelaide Community Healthcare Alliance
                    Incorporated (Ashford Hospital) (“ACHA”), and as a self-employed
                    physiotherapist contracted to another health care provider, Sportsmed SA
                    (“Sportsmed”). However, she only started work at ACHA on
                    16 June 2003, barely six months before the date of the accident, working an
                    average of about 38 hours a week with a wage of AUD$28.01 per hour as at the
                    time of the accident. There was no concrete evidence on the income that the
                    Respondent was receiving from her contract with Sportsmed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Following the accident, the Respondent decided
                    to make better use of her idle time on medical leave. For a few months towards
                    the end of 2004, she did some casual data entry and analysis work. From January
                    2005 to February 2006, she studied full-time in the bachelor of health science
                    course at the University of South Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the beginning of March 2006, following the
                    completion of her degree course and the expiry of her medical leave, the
                    Respondent returned to work at ACHA, but on a part-time basis and performing
                    only light duties. On 2 January 2007, the Respondent returned to full-time
                    work at ACHA. However, she soon found that she was not able to perform her
                    duties as well as she could before the accident, and also that her work was too
                    painful and exhausting to cope with. As a result, on 4 February 2007, the
                    Respondent resigned from her full-time work at ACHA. From 5 February 2007
                    onwards, the Respondent joined a private outpatient physiotherapy practice,
                    PhysioONE. There, she initially worked on a casual basis for up to five hours a
                    day for three days a week. Over time, she increased her working hours. As at the
                    time of the assessment of damages proceedings, she worked for an average of 34
                    hours a week with the most recent documentary evidence on her salary indicating
                    that her wage was AUD$38.769 per hour. On 25 June 2007, the Respondent
                    rejoined her previous employer ACHA on a part-time basis. Thus, it would appear
                    that at the time of the assessment of damages proceedings, the Respondent held
                    two part-time jobs. In her tax returns for the year ending 30 June 2007,
                    the Respondent reportedly earned AUD$53,701 (although she stated in her closing
                    submissions before the AR that she was earning AUD$67,449.20).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings before the AR and the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After hearing the parties, the AR made the
                    following awards (in addition to two agreed items and two very small sums which
                    we need not be concerned about) in favour of the Respondent:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">S$135,000 for pain, suffering and loss of
                            amenities;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">AUD$209,078.66 for pre-trial loss of
                            earnings;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">AUD$305,195.04 for loss of future
                            earnings;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">AUD$15,000 for loss of earning
                        capacity;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">AUD$49,346.70 for future medical expenses;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">AUD$91,804.99 for loss of annual
                        leave.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Dissatisfied with several components of the damages awarded, both
                    parties appealed. The Appellant, we would mention in particular, sought to have
                    the award for loss of future earnings set aside, as well as to have the quantum
                    awarded for pre-trial loss of earnings, loss of future earning capacity and loss
                    of annual leave reduced. On appeal, the Judge, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, reduced the quantum awarded for pre-trial loss of earnings
                    to AUD$202,061.08, increased the amount awarded for pain, suffering and loss of
                    amenities to $200,000 (an increase of $65,000), and increased the quantum
                    awarded for loss of earning capacity to AUD$50,000. The Judge’s detailed
                    reasons for his decision are set out in <em>Shaw Linda Gillian v
                        Chai Kang Wei Samuel</em> [2009] SGHC 187 (“the
                    Judgment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In his Notice of Appeal to this court, the
                    Appellant raised the following grounds of appeal against the Judge’s
                    decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the quantum awarded for pain,
                        suffering and loss of amenities arising from the Respondent’s head
                        injuries was excessive;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the quantum awarded for loss of future earnings
                        was correct in law;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the quantum awarded for loss of earning capacity was
                        excessive, when loss of future earnings was also awarded;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether there
                        was sufficient basis to support the quantum awarded for pre-trial loss of
                        earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In addition to these grounds, the Appellant
                    raised two other grounds in relation to the quantum awarded for the damage to
                    the Respondent’s anterior cruciate ligament and for the Respondent’s
                    medical leave for future treatment. However, prior to the hearing before us, the
                    Appellant decided to abandon these two additional grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It will be apposite to begin by setting out our
                    views on certain general principles concerning loss of future earnings and loss
                    of earning capacity. The Appellant made extensive submissions on the nature and
                    distinction between loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity. The
                    Appellant contended that, in the circumstances of the present case, the
                    Respondent should be awarded loss of earning capacity and not loss of future
                    earnings. He contended that where the evidence of a victim’s loss of
                    future earnings was either sketchy or speculative, which he submitted was the
                    case here, a lump sum award for loss of earning capacity would be the correct
                    award to make, as opposed to an award for loss of future earnings. He also
                    submitted that even if the court should find that there was sufficient evidence
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Respondent’s loss of
                    future earnings, the award for loss of earning capacity should not be a
                    significant sum if the amount awarded for loss of future earnings was
                    substantial. In reply, the Respondent did not disagree with the principles of
                    law advanced by the Appellant, but she disagreed with the way the Appellant
                    sought to apply them to the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It would be useful if we address the true
                    nature of loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity. The two heads of
                    damages are not strictly alternative to each other, although in an appropriate
                    case, if the plaintiff should fail in his or her claim for loss of future
                    earnings, he or she could nevertheless be awarded damages for loss of earning
                    capacity. The two heads of damages do not necessarily share any symbiotic
                    relationship, as they are distinct and are meant to compensate different losses
                    suffered by an injured plaintiff. A good starting point for an understanding of
                    these two heads of damages is the case of <em>Ashcroft v
                        Curtin</em> [1971] 3 All ER 1208 (“<em>Ashcroft</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff was a skilful
                    precision engineer who had his own successful one-man sole proprietorship
                    converted into a limited company in which he and his family held all the shares.
                    Unfortunately, he met with an accident when the defendant’s van collided
                    into his car as he stopped at a crossing to let pedestrians cross. As a result
                    of the injuries he sustained from the accident, he could no longer work as hard
                    as he used to. He was noted to be slower and less efficient. For four years
                    after the accident, there was a reduction in the profits of the
                    plaintiff’s company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The trial judge quantified the loss suffered
                    at £1,500 per year and applied a multiplier of seven years, giving a total
                    award of £10,500 for loss of future earnings. On appeal, the English Court
                    of Appeal reduced the trial judge’s award for loss of future earnings to
                    £2,500. Edmund Davies LJ, who delivered the main judgment, held that
                    although the evidence pointed to both a decrease in the profitability of the
                    company and that the decrease was due to the injuries and disabilities sustained
                    by the plaintiff in the accident, the evidence was so vague that it was quite
                    impossible to quantify the loss. Edmund Davies LJ then went on to address
                    the alternative allegation stated in the amended statement of claim, <em>viz</em>, that “by reason of his injuries the
                    plaintiff has been permanently prevented from working as an engineer” (at
                    1214). Finding in favour of the plaintiff, he held that the plaintiff’s
                    capacity to engage himself outside the company, in respect of finding the sort
                    of work for which he had been trained since the age of 14, had been virtually
                    extinguished. This was the basis for the award of £2,500. In our view,
                    although the award was termed as loss of future earnings, it was clear that the
                    court in <em>Ashcroft</em> was actually referring to what
                    is now known as loss of earning capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     While the boundaries between a claim for loss
                    of earning capacity and that for loss of future earnings appears hazy, Lord
                    Denning MR pointed out in the later case of <em>Fairley v John
                        Thomson (Design and Contracting Division) Ltd</em> [1973]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 40 (“<em>Fairley</em>”) that these two heads of damages are indeed separate
                    and distinct. In that case, the plaintiff sued his employers for serious
                    injuries sustained at his workplace. After he returned to work with his
                    pre-accident employers, his employment was later terminated. The plaintiff
                    subsequently managed to find a higher paying job. Notwithstanding this increase
                    in the plaintiff’s earnings, the trial judge went on to award the
                    plaintiff loss of future earnings. However, on appeal, the English Court of
                    Appeal found this to be clearly wrong. In the court’s view, since the
                    plaintiff managed to get a higher paying job, there was no loss on which the
                    award for loss of future earnings could be based. In overturning the decision of
                    the lower court, Lord Denning outlined the differences between these two heads
                    of damages (at 42):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is important to realize that there is a difference between an award for
                        loss of earnings as distinct from compensation for loss of earning capacity.
                            <em>Compensation for loss of future earnings is awarded
                            for real assessable loss proved by evidence. Compensation for diminution
                            in earning capacity is awarded as part of general damages</em>. If
                        I may give an instance, a manual worker may be incapacitated for manual
                        work, but after the accident he may learn a clerical trade. At his new trade
                        he may actually earn more than he would have done before. He will have
                        diminished earning capacity, but he has not lost any future earnings.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the facts of that case, the English Court of Appeal found that the
                    plaintiff did not suffer any loss of future earnings, but, rather, a loss of
                    earning capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     While Lord Denning made it clear that there
                        <em>was</em> a difference between loss of future
                    earnings and loss of earning capacity, it was only in the even later English
                    Court of Appeal case of <em>Smith v Manchester
                        Corporation</em> [1974] 1 KIR 1 (“<em>Smith v Manchester</em>”) that the conceptual principles
                    demarcating the two heads of damages were established. In that case, the
                    plaintiff, after sustaining an injury at work, retained her job with her
                    pre-accident employers and was paid the same pre-accident pay. However, that
                    injury had caused the plaintiff to suffer from a “frozen shoulder”
                    syndrome and she was rendered severely disabled. The plaintiff, as a result,
                    could not carry out most of her duties that required the use of both hands.
                    Notwithstanding her resulting disabilities, the plaintiff was fortunate to have
                    the opportunity to return to her pre-accident work only because her employers
                    and colleagues were compassionate and considerate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Although Scarman LJ did not expressly
                    define it as such, it was clear that he viewed loss of future earnings as
                    referring to a loss arising from a situation where a victim of an accident finds
                    that he or she can no longer, as a result of the accident, earn his or her
                    pre-accident rate of earnings (see 7). In other words, loss of future earnings
                    refers to the difference between post-accident and pre-accident income or rate
                    of income. Obviously, if the victim earns a post-accident income or rate of
                    income which is more than his or her pre-accident income or rate of income, no
                    award for loss of future earnings should be made. In contrast, loss of earning
                    capacity, as Scarman LJ indicated, addresses the loss arising from the
                    weakening of the plaintiff’s competitive position in the open labour
                    market (see 8).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Lastly, in <em>Moeliker v A
                        Reyrolle and Co Ltd</em> [1977] 1 All ER 9
                        (“<em>Moeliker</em>”), the English Court
                    of Appeal reaffirmed that a claim for loss of earning capacity arises where a
                    plaintiff is in employment at the time of the trial, but there is a risk that he
                    or she may lose this employment at some time in the future, and may then, as a
                    result of his or her injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an
                    equally well paid job (see 17). In this regard, the English Court of Appeal
                    indicated that the use of a formula (<em>ie</em>, the
                    multiplicand/multiplier method) would not be appropriate to reflect the
                    above-mentioned risk. For such a situation, a global sum award would be the
                    correct option to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In so far as the law in Singapore is
                    concerned, this court had the occasion to consider the differences between loss
                    of future earnings and loss of earning capacity in the case of <em>Teo Sing Keng and anor v Sim Ban Kiat</em> [1994]
                    1 SLR(R) 340 (“<em>Teo Sing
                    Keng</em>”), and the principles elucidated in the English cases
                    dealt with in the preceding paragraphs were affirmed. This court concluded (at
                    [40]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An award for loss of earning capacity, as opposed to an award
                        for loss of earnings, is generally made in the following cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    where, at the time of trial, the plaintiff is
                                in employment and has suffered no loss of earnings, but there is a
                                risk that he may lose that employment at some time in the future,
                                and may then, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in
                                getting another job or an equally well paid job; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    where there is no available evidence of the
                                plaintiff’s earnings to enable the court to properly calculate
                                future earnings, for example, young children who have no earnings on
                                which to base an assessment for loss of future
                            earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The “alternate measure” view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Appellant took the view that if there was
                    insufficient evidence to establish the Respondent’s loss of future
                    earnings, loss of earning capacity should be awarded instead. In this
                    connection, the Appellant seemed to assume a relationship between the failure to
                    prove loss of future earnings and an award for loss of earning capacity,
                        <em>viz</em>, that an award for loss of earning
                    capacity is an “alternate measure” when a plaintiff lacks
                    sufficient evidence to prove his or her loss of future earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     This “alternate measure” view
                    appears to have originated from the case of <em>Choy Kuo Wen v
                        Soh Chin Seng</em> [2008] SGHC 113 (“<em>Choy Kup Wen</em>”), where the court, in dealing with
                    the circumstances in which an award for loss of earning capacity would be
                    appropriate, said (at [37]–[39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    There is another category of cases where the court
                            have [<em>sic</em>] stated that it awards damages
                            for loss of earning capacity as a <em>substitute measure
                                in preference to awarding for loss of future earnings. This is where
                                the evidence of a plaintiff’s loss in future earnings may not
                                be available or ambiguous, making it impossible for a proper
                                calculation of loss of future earnings, on the basis of the
                                multiplicand/multiplier method</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    In essence, the courts in such situations find it
                            more appropriate to award a figure in the round as compensation for the
                            reduction in a plaintiff’s earning ability. The damage on a
                            plaintiff is more effectively assessed in terms of his reduced ability
                            to work and/or maintain a certain level of income.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    This second category can be described as the
                                “<em>alternate measure</em>”
                            category. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     We would make three observations in relation
                    to the above passage. First, it is trite law that a plaintiff has the burden of
                    proving his or her claim in damages (see <em>Bonham-Carter v Hyde
                        Park Hotel, Limited</em> (1948) 64 TLR 177 at 178). That
                    said, as Lord Denning MR clearly pointed out in <em>Fairley</em>, loss of future earnings must be “real assessable
                    loss proved by evidence” (at 42). Therefore, if a plaintiff should fail
                    to provide sufficient evidence of loss of future earnings, his or her claim for
                    loss of future earnings cannot succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Secondly, in the event that there is a lack of
                    sufficient evidence proving loss of future earnings, this cannot, by itself,
                        <em>convert</em> a claim for loss of future earnings
                    into a claim for loss of earning capacity. These two heads of damages are meant
                    to compensate for different losses – loss of future earnings compensates
                    for the difference between the post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of
                    income, while loss of earning capacity compensates for the risk or disadvantage,
                    which the plaintiff would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the job
                    that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job in the open
                    employment market. Since loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity
                    are separate and distinct, the Appellant’s suggestion that the failure to
                    prove loss of future earnings should lead to an award for loss of earning
                    capacity is conceptually erroneous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Thirdly, this confusion could have been due in
                    part to some of the past cases where awards for both loss of future earnings and
                    loss of earning capacity were plausible on the given set of facts. For example,
                    in <em>Ashcroft</em>, as interpreted by <em>Moeliker</em>, the English Court of Appeal decided to award loss of
                    earning capacity, overruling the lower court’s decision to award loss of
                    future earnings. The court reasoned that the evidence to prove loss of future
                    earnings was extremely vague. The injuries suffered by the plaintiff made him
                    slower and less efficient, thus increasing the risk that he might not be able to
                    find a similar income-generating job had he been forced into the labour market.
                    Such a risk justified the grant of an award for loss of earning capacity.
                    However, an award for loss of future earnings was also a possibility. The
                    evidence pointed to a correlation between the injuries and the plaintiff’s
                    loss in profitability. In light of all the evidence before it, however, the
                    court felt that the evidence was too vague to be of assistance to quantify the
                    alleged loss of future earnings. <em>Ashcroft</em>,
                    therefore, is illustrative of the fact that it is the evidence which will
                    determine whether the court should, upon refusing to grant an award based on
                    loss of future earnings, additionally grant an award based on loss of earning
                    capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     What we would emphasise is that there is no
                    substantive link between a lack of evidence to substantiate a claim for loss of
                    future earnings and the granting of an award for loss of earning capacity as
                    appeared to have been suggested in <em>Choy Kup Wen</em>.
                    Perhaps the way it was put in <em>Choy Hup Wen</em> was
                    simply a <em>descriptive practical effect</em> of a case
                    where there was the possibility of awards based on both heads of damages, but
                    the evidence, in the end, was sufficient to justify only one award based on one
                    or the other of the two heads. This would be supported, albeit implicitly, by
                    the reasoning of the Malaysian Federal Court decision in <em>Ong
                        Ah Long v Dr S Underwood</em> [1983] 2 MLJ 324
                        (“<em>Ong Ah Long</em>”) where the court
                    stated (at 333):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There must be evidence on which the court can find that the plaintiff will
                        suffer future loss of earnings, it cannot act on mere speculation. If there
                        is no satisfactory evidence of future loss of earnings <em>but the court is satisfied</em> that the plaintiff has suffered a
                        loss of earning capacity, it will award him damages for his loss of capacity
                        as part of the general damages for disability and not as compensation for
                        future loss of earnings. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We should also address the Appellant’s
                    argument that in the event that the court found that there was sufficient
                    evidence to award loss of future earnings, then only a nominal award for loss of
                    earning capacity should be given where a substantial award was made for loss of
                    future earnings. In making this contention, the Appellant assumed that there was
                    an inverse relationship between the two heads of damages. No authority was cited
                    in support of this proposition. Given that we have pointed out earlier that the
                    two heads of damages are separate and distinct, it must also naturally mean
                    there is simply no remaining logical basis for such an argument to succeed. The
                    Appellant’s proposition of an inverse relationship seemed to assume that
                    there was an overlapping loss component in <em>both</em>
                    heads of damages. However, the Appellant failed to point out any overlapping
                    compensatory factor to support a proposition that such an inverse relationship
                    existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Finally, there is one other general comment
                    which we would make. There is nothing in principle which bars a plaintiff from
                    being entitled to claim for both loss of future earnings and loss of earning
                    capacity, provided that the necessary evidence is present. In this connection,
                    we would refer to the judgment of Browne LJ in <em>Moeliker</em> where he said (at 15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This court made it clear … that [<em>Smith v
                            Manchester</em>] laid down no new principle of law, and I entirely
                        agree. [<em>Smith v Manchester</em>] is merely an
                        example of an award of damages under a head which has long been recognised
                        – a plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity where as a result of
                        his injury his chances in the future of getting in the labour market work
                        (or work as well paid as before the accident) have been diminished by his
                        injury. … This head of damage generally arises where a plaintiff is,
                        at the time of the trial, in employment, but there is a risk that he may
                        lose this employment at some time in the future and may then, as a result of
                        his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an equally well
                        paid job. It is a different head of damages from an actual loss of future
                        earnings <em>which can already be proved at the time of the
                            trial</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     To reiterate again, loss of future earnings
                    and loss of earning capacity compensate different losses. We can best illustrate
                    the point by an example. Suppose an injured person was taken back by his
                    pre-accident employer to do a less demanding job due to his disabilities but at
                    a lower pay. If the employer cannot guarantee how long he will be so employed
                    but will do so as long as possible, it seems to us that the injured victim
                    should be entitled to awards based on both heads of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on loss of future earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We now turn to consider the arguments of the
                    Appellant which touched on the quantum of AUD$448,195.04 awarded by the AR for
                    loss of future earnings which the Judge subsequently affirmed. The Appellant
                    argued, firstly, that the Respondent did not suffer any loss of earnings after
                    she recovered from her injuries, and secondly, in the alternative, that there
                    was no assessable loss proved by the evidence to allow the court to make an
                    award for loss of future earnings without going into the realm of speculation.
                    The Appellant also raised a third issue of whether the Respondent’s
                    part-time work at ACHA after the accident should have been deducted from the
                    award of loss of future earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On the first argument, it was our view that
                    the Respondent did in fact suffer from a loss of future earnings. As correctly
                    pointed out by the AR and the Judge, such a loss stemmed from the difference
                    between the plaintiff’s post-accident earnings and the earnings she would
                    have made at the time of the assessment of damages proceedings, but for the
                    accident. Between the submissions of both parties, the dispute largely centred
                    on the determination of “post-accident income”. The argument of
                    the Appellant was to the effect that since what the Respondent earned some four
                    years later was slightly more than what was her average yearly income over a
                    period of four years before the accident, she had therefore suffered no loss of
                    future earnings. The Appellant’s view might seem rational had it not been
                    for the special circumstances of this case. It will be recalled that the
                    Respondent worked as a physiotherapist and <em>she was paid at an
                        hourly rate</em>. Due to inflation and natural progression, the hourly
                    rate she was paid had increased by the time of the assessment of damages
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The loss which the Respondent alleged was
                    that, due to her injuries, she was no longer able to work 38 hours a week, which
                    was what she was able to do before the accident. It would therefore be wholly
                    inequitable to say that because what she earned in absolute figures
                    post-accident was the same or slightly more than what was her average yearly
                    income pre-accident, she had thus suffered no loss. This failed to take into
                    account inflation and the fact that with greater experience she would, in the
                    normal course of events, be paid a higher rate of remuneration for her
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The court must examine the circumstances of
                    each case to determine whether there is loss of future earnings. It was
                    therefore overly simplistic to suggest that the court should merely constrain
                    itself by comparing the absolute figures <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    what the plaintiff earned pre-accident and post-accident and nothing else. Such
                    an approach may be used without injustice in some cases, but not all. Whether
                    such an approach should be used in a particular case must depend on the facts of
                    the case in question. In our view, there was no merit to the Appellant’s
                    argument. The approach taken by the AR and the Judge provided a more accurate
                    reflection of the losses that the Respondent had suffered. The overarching
                    objective of awarding damages is to <em>compensate</em> the
                    injured victim by restoring him or her to the position that he or she would have
                    been (in a monetary sense) had the accident not happened. As Lord Blackburn in
                        <em>Livingstone v The Rawyards Coal Co</em> (1880)
                    5 App Cas 25 stated (at 39):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think there is any difference of opinion as to its being a
                        general rule that, where any injury is to be compensated by damages, in
                        settling the sum of money to be given for reparation of damages you should
                        as nearly as possible get at that sum of money which will put the party who
                        has been injured, or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have
                        been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his
                        compensation or reparation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, the Appellant’s method of determining loss unfairly
                    prejudiced the Respondent by crystallising her income as at the date of injury.
                    In contrast, the approach taken by the AR and the Judge accurately reflected the
                    number of hours the Respondent would have worked had the accident not occurred.
                    Such an approach, in our view, satisfied the compensatory principle of damages,
                    as it fairly and accurately reflected the loss that the Respondent suffered as a
                    result of the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We also found no merit to the
                    Appellant’s argument that there was insufficient evidence to assess a loss
                    of earnings. The quantum awarded for loss of future earnings was calculated
                    based on the <em>actual</em> number of hours the Respondent
                    had worked before the accident and the <em>actual</em> rate
                    that the Respondent was earning after the accident. In other words, the quantum
                    awarded was calculated based on figures that were not plucked out of thin air.
                    Cumulatively, the evidence was concrete enough for the AR and the Judge to
                    utilise. Accordingly, the Appellant’s argument in this respect was not a
                    sufficient basis for us to disturb the determination of the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As for the third argument, the Appellant
                    averred that both the AR and the Judge erred by failing to deduct the additional
                    part-time work that the Respondent undertook at ACHA after the accident in
                    determining loss of future earnings. We were unable to accept this argument. To
                    begin with, the AR had, in fact, held that the income from the additional
                    part-time work done was to be deducted in the calculation of loss of future
                    earnings. In addition, the part-time income was clearly factored into the award
                    for loss of future earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Let us explain. The Respondent submitted that
                    her post-accident income was AUD$58,490.85, (an amount that was made up of
                    income from her part-time work at ACHA <em>and</em>
                    PhysioONE), which was to be used to calculate her pre-trial loss of earnings.
                    The AR instead adopted the higher figure of AUD$59,525.39, submitted by the
                    Appellant, to ascertain the final award for pre-trial earnings for the period of
                    1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008. Although these figures were initially
                    used to determine the pre-trial loss of earnings, it was used again to determine
                    loss of future earnings. It was the original intention of the AR to continue
                    using the same figure of AUD$59,525.39 to represent the Respondent’s
                    post-accident income. However, the AR decided to utilise the higher figure of
                    $67,449.20, which the Respondent had set out in her closing submissions. The
                    usage of that figure was to the disadvantage of the Respondent since the higher
                    the post-accident income, the lower would be the loss of future earnings to be
                    awarded. In our view, since the lower figure already did take into account the
                    Respondent’s part-time work at ACHA, the higher figure eventually adopted
                    must have included that amount as well. Accordingly, in our view, no error was
                    made in the calculation of the award for loss of future earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on loss of earning capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     With reference to loss of earning capacity,
                    the Appellant raised two issues. First, whether loss of earning capacity could
                    be awarded if there was no risk of the Respondent losing her post-accident job.
                    Second, whether there was sufficient basis for the Judge to increase the award
                    for loss of earning capacity. It would be recalled that the Judge increased the
                    quantum for this head from AUD$15,000 to AUD$50,000. In response, the Respondent
                    took the position that such an award could be granted even though there was no
                    outright risk that she might lose her current jobs. She argued that such an
                    award could be justified given the part-time nature, and thus, volatility of the
                    income she was earning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The AR felt that a conservative amount should
                    be awarded for this head to reflect the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Respondent had not shown that
                        there was any appreciable risk that she would lose her post-accident
                        job.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Respondent would not be disadvantaged greatly by her injuries when finding
                        commensurate part-time employment. In this regard, although the Respondent
                        had applied unsuccessfully for a physiotherapist job application at
                        Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre, it was unclear whether the rejection was
                        due to her injuries. Also, the evidence showed that Respondent was handling
                        longer working hours as time passed, and this would be a factor that would
                        add to her marketability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However on appeal, the Judge thought that the
                    AR did not adequately appreciate the fact that the Respondent might have to
                    undergo total knee replacement and revision knee replacement sometime in the
                    future. After such surgery, there would be the likelihood that she might not be
                    able to continue her currently physically demanding physiotherapist job. Taking
                    into account her disabilities and the nature of her degree, the Judge held that
                    the Respondent would have some difficultly in securing an alternative desk job.
                    He concluded that the AR’s award was on the low side and increased it to
                    AUD$50,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Both the AR and the Judge seemed to take the
                    view that loss of earning capacity could be awarded even if there was no risk
                    that the injured victim might lose his or her current post-accident job. Such an
                    award could be granted so long as the injured victim would be disadvantaged in
                    finding a similar paying job because of the injuries and resulting disabilities.
                    This approach would appear to run contrary to the principles discussed above and
                    adopted in <em>Teo Sing Keng</em>. It is trite that an
                    award for loss of earning capacity (in the context where the plaintiff is
                    currently employed) can only be awarded <em>if there is a
                        substantial or real risk</em> that the plaintiff could lose his or her
                    present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life and
                    that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the
                    open employment market. It is a cumulative test. In <em>Moeliker</em>, Brown LJ stated (at 17):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not think one can say more by way of principle than this. The
                        consideration of this head of damages should be made in two stages. 1. Is
                        there a ‘substantial’ or ‘real’ risk that a
                        plaintiff will lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of
                        his working life? 2. If there is (<em>but not
                            otherwise</em>), the court must assess and quantify the present
                        value of the risk of the financial damage which the plaintiff will suffer if
                        that risk materialises, having regard to the degree of the risk, the time
                        when it may materialise, and the factors, both favourable and unfavourable,
                        which in a particular case will, or may, affect the plaintiff's chances of
                        getting a job at all, or an equally well paid job. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Following from this, no award for loss of earning capacity should be
                    granted if there is no risk of the Respondent’s post-accident employment
                    being terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     That said, we must emphasise the fact that we
                    were not dealing with the normal situation where the injured person was in
                    full-time employment with a fixed monthly salary. Here, the Respondent was
                    engaged in part-time employment at hourly rates. While her employers, ACHA and
                    PhysioONE, had not given any indication that they would terminate her part-time
                    employment on account of her disabilities, this was no indication that they
                    would keep her in such employment for what would have been her normal working
                    life. The fact of the matter was that she was under disabilities, and could not,
                    for example, work long hours, attend to patients in wards, and physically assist
                    patients. To suggest that these negative factors would not make the
                    Respondent’s risk of losing her post-accident employment a real risk would
                    be to ignore the obvious. It must also be borne in mind that the Respondent was
                    not a long-standing part-time employee of ACHA and PhysioONE. She was a fairly
                    new employee, especially in respect to PhysioONE. Equally pertinent was the fact
                    that, even if her employment at ACHA and PhysioONE were not terminated, her
                    disabilities could also affect the number of hours of work that she presently
                    could undertake. There was clearly some degree of uncertainty regarding the
                    Respondent’s post-accident employment that could not be disregarded. That
                    said, if the Respondent was to be compelled to re-enter the labour market, her
                    disabilities would, no doubt, put her at some disadvantage. Accordingly, we were
                    of the view that an award for loss of earning capacity was
                justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Quite rightly, the AR took a conservative
                    approach in the quantification of this head of damages. Having found the
                    Respondent was not very much disadvantaged by her injuries to find commensurate
                    part-time employment, he concluded that there was an appreciably lower risk that
                    she would be unable to get another job. Given the lower risk, only a low award
                    was warranted (see, also, <em>Moeliker</em> at 18). The sum
                    of AUD$15,000 awarded for loss of earning capacity was only a fraction of her
                    post-accident yearly income and could hardly be considered to be excessive. We
                    could not, in contrast, agree with the Judge’s reasoning in increasing the
                    award for loss of earning capacity to AUD$50,000. He stated (see the Judgement
                    at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, the AR may have overlooked the fact that the plaintiff [<em>ie</em>, the Respondent] might have to undergo total knee
                        replacement and revision knee replacement sometime in the future. After her
                        knee surgery, there is a likelihood that the plaintiff might not be able to
                        continue with her present rather physically demanding job of being a part
                        time physiotherapist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">First, as noted by the AR and the Judge, the need for knee replacement
                    surgery in the future was about 50%. Second, even if there was such surgery, it
                    did not necessarily follow that the Respondent’s condition would get
                    worse. The Judge seemed to assume that such a possibility amounted to a
                    likelihood. We did not think that such an assumption was justified. Accordingly,
                    we allowed the appeal on this head of damages and reinstated the amount awarded
                    by the AR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on pre-trial loss of earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For this head of damages, the AR awarded a
                    total amount of AUD$209,078.66 for the various periods between the date of the
                    accident and the date of the assessment of damages proceedings. On appeal, the
                    Judge reduced this amount to AUD$202,061.08. Before us, the Appellant argued
                    that this sum was excessive for two reasons. First, he questioned whether any
                    loss of earnings should be awarded for the period when the Respondent was
                    pursuing her degree course. Second, the income which the Respondent had earned
                    doing data entry work for a few months towards the end of 2004 prior to the
                    Respondent’s commencement of her degree course should be regarded as
                    income which she could have earned for the whole of 2005 and
                beyond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The duration of the degree course that the
                    Respondent had undertaken was from January 2005 to March 2007. Before us, as
                    before the AR and the Judge, the Appellant argued that the Respondent should not
                    be compensated for her loss of earnings during this period of time since she
                    could have found a job and should have mitigated her losses. In reply, the
                    Respondent averred that she should not be deprived of her loss of earnings
                    simply because she chose to keep herself occupied. In our view, the
                    Respondent’s decision to enrol for a degree course was a reasonable
                    consequence of the accident. If not for the accident, the Respondent would not
                    be on medical leave and would therefore not have the necessary amount of free
                    time to undertake the course. If not for the accident, the Respondent would not
                    have the opportunity or inclination to enrol in the course. Accordingly, there
                    was no legal basis to deprive the Respondent of her loss of earnings for the
                    period in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The second reason related to certain data
                    entry work which the Respondent undertook for a few months prior to her
                    commencement of her degree course, <em>ie</em>, at the end
                    of 2004. During this period, the Respondent managed to earn a total of AUD$3,410
                    from doing such work. Both the AR and the Judge agreed with the Appellant and
                    held that this amount constituted the Respondent’s mitigated losses and
                    should be deducted accordingly from the quantum for loss of pre-trial earnings
                    to be awarded. What the Appellant contended further was that this amount earned
                    should be pro-rated and extended to cover the entire period under review. If she
                    could undertake the data entry work for those few months, there was no reason
                    why she could not continue with that work into 2005. The Respondent was under a
                    duty to mitigate, and if she had, the amount of damages which the Appellant
                    would have to bear would be reduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In our view, the Appellant’s argument
                    was flawed. It must be borne in mind that during the period in question, the
                    Respondent was, due to the injuries she suffered, on medical leave. She
                    therefore had no duty to mitigate her losses. Although the Respondent worked for
                    a few months towards the end of 2004, her salary had been appropriately and
                    properly taken into account. Moreover, the Respondent was not asked why she did
                    not continue working on a part-time basis. There could well have been a
                    reasonable explanation in this connection. If the Respondent was questioned on
                    this, she could very well have provided acceptable answers, and it would be
                    unfair if the Appellant’s argument was to succeed without her having the
                    opportunity to provide answers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Having dismissed the Appellant’s
                    submissions pertaining to this head of claim, we had no further reason to
                    disturb the award of the Judge for pre-trial loss of earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on pain and suffering arising from the head
                injuries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Both the AR and the Judge adopted a component
                    approach to assess the damages to be awarded for the Respondent’s head
                    injuries. In such an approach, a court would analyse the various components of
                    damage caused by a head injury, namely, structural damage, psychological damage,
                    and cognitive damage. Utilising such an approach, the AR awarded the Respondent
                    the amounts of $29,000 for structural damage, $10,000 for psychological damage,
                    and $10,000 for cognitive damage. However, on appeal, the learned Judge
                    increased the quantum to $54,000 for structural damage, $25,000 for
                    psychological damage, but left the amount for cognitive damage
                unchanged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In deciding to increase the award for the
                    component of structural damage, the Judge reasoned (see the Judgment at
                    [7]–[9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    The plaintiff [<em>ie</em>, the
                            Respondent] sought a much higher composite award of S$108,000 claiming
                            S$25,000 for base of skull fracture, S$75,000 for TBI [<em>ie</em>, traumatic brain injury], and a further
                            S$4,000 each for right parietal scalp haematoma and right head
                            indentation respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    In arriving at the proper award under this claim, I
                            have given due consideration to the fact that the severe TBI sustained
                            by the plaintiff did result in a total loss of consciousness with a GCS
                                [<em>ie</em>, Glasgow Coma Scale] score of 3/15
                            (which I understand is the lowest possible). It was indeed so severe
                            that she was rendered unable to sustain her own breathing and required
                            life-saving emergency intubation and she had to rely on external
                            ventilation from 6 December 2003 to 13 December 2003 to stay alive. She
                            suffered traumatic subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhage, developed such
                            significant cerebral oedema as to require invasive monitoring of her
                            intracranial pressure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    In my view, a higher award should be given in the
                            light of the extensive structural head damage and I therefore raised the
                            award to <b><u>S$54,000.00</u></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[bold and underlining in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     And with reference to the increase in the
                    award for the component of psychological damage, the Judge stated (see the
                    Judgment at [12]–[13]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    In arriving at the proper quantum under this head,
                            special consideration was given to the psychologist’s evidence
                            that the plaintiff [<em>ie</em>, the Respondent]
                            was still suffering from depression and this was further complicated by
                            denial 5.5 years after the accident. I accept the psychologist’s
                            testimony that denial can exist in depressed patients as a coping
                            strategy and its existence makes further psychological treatment
                            difficult. I therefore find that the plaintiff’s non-compliance
                            with psychological therapy as a result of her denial of her depression
                            cannot be taken against her. Further consideration was given to the
                            expert’s assessment that her depressive symptoms would likely
                            continue to have a significant impact on her daily life
                        ….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    In view of the prolonged suffering and the high
                            likelihood that this depression would continue into the future, I shall
                            increase the award to <b><u>S$25,000</u></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[bold and underlining in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The arguments which the Appellant made in
                    relation to the quantum awarded for pain and suffering for the head injuries
                    suffered were twofold. First, it was wrong for the AR and the Judge to adopt a
                    component approach to assess the damages to be awarded for the head injuries.
                    Second, the increases in the quantum awarded for the structural damage and
                    psychological damage components made by the Judge were
                unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the first argument, the point made was
                    that the component approach did not have sufficient regard to the fact that the
                    injuries, and resulting disabilities, were all essentially caused by one single
                    injury. It was emphasised that such an approach would lead to a high possibility
                    of over-compensation as a result of sub-itemisation. As we see it, such
                    sub-itemisation was no more than an instrument to aid the court to determine
                    what would be a fair and reasonable quantification for a particular injury or
                    disability having regard to precedents. It enables the court to address the
                    different aspects of pain, suffering and loss of amenities arising out of an
                    injury systematically. The benefits of such an approach were clearly stated in
                        <em>Tan Yu Min Winston (by his next friend Tan Cheng Tong) v
                        Uni-Fruitveg Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 825 (at
                    [25]–[26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    The correct and
                            perhaps more scientific way to look at the head injuries to the brain
                            resulting from an accident is to properly classify them into the
                            following three separate domains: structural, psychological and
                            cognitive:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    “structural” injury (<em>eg</em>, brain oedema, subdural, extradural
                                subarachnoid haematoma, brain contusion, loss of consciousness),
                                which is the specialisation of neurosurgeons;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    “psychological“ injury
                                    (<em>eg</em>, depression, mood swings,
                                anger, anxiety), which is the specialisation of psychiatrists;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    “cognitive” impairment
                                    (<em>eg</em>, loss of spatial, visual, long
                                and short term memory, intellect (in terms of IQ), learning
                                ability), which is the specialisation of clinical
                                psychologists.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    The deficits in each of the above domains are
                            clearly separate and distinguishable and in my view should be assessed
                            separately if it is possible to do so. I can see another benefit that
                            this approach can bring from an evidentiary point of view. I believe
                            that it will be clearer and more streamlined for the experts from each
                            of the three different specialisations to give evidence within their own
                            specialisation as to the degree of pain, suffering and loss of amenities
                            due separately to the “structural” injury, the
                            “psychological” injury and the “cognitive”
                            impairment arising from the accident injury, trauma or damage to the
                            brain. Quantification of the loss for each of the three quite different
                            types of injuries can then be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Damages are awarded on the basis of the
                    injuries sustained and the resulting pain and suffering and loss of amenities
                        <em>that followed</em>, and not merely on the number of
                    injuries inflicted. Admittedly the problem of overlapping or under-compensation
                    can occur when there are multiple injuries causing similar, if not the same,
                    disabilities. However, for the purposes of this appeal, the Appellant failed to
                    show to us why and how the Respondent was over-compensated for her head injuries
                    through the component approach. Properly applied, the component approach could
                    indeed prevent over-compensation rather than encourage it. Nevertheless, in
                    awarding damages by way of the component approach, courts should always be
                    mindful that the overall quantum must be a reasonable sum reflective of the
                    totality of the injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     With regard to the second argument, we agreed
                    with the Appellant that the Judge should not have increased the amount awarded
                    for pain, suffering and loss of amenities pertaining to the Respondent’s
                    head injuries. In deciding what would be an appropriate amount to award for an
                    injury, the court ought to consider the full circumstances of the case. Not only
                    are the injuries suffered by the victim relevant, the recovery after the
                    accident must also be considered. In the present case, though the initial
                    position looked ominous, the Respondent made significant recovery. Immediately
                    on her return to Australia she was admitted to the Brain Injury Rehabilitation
                    Unit at the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in January 2004, and her
                    physiotherapist noted that she was progressing well in the span of a few weeks.
                    Slightly over a year after her accident, the Respondent had recovered
                    sufficiently to be able to drive. Moreover, the clinical neuropsychologist
                    report dated 2 July 2005 noted that the Respondent was demonstrating good
                    cognitive recovery. By the time the Respondent was re-assessed on
                    22 February 2008, she was again reported to have made significant
                    improvements. In increasing the award, the Judge appeared very much minded by
                    the serious injuries that the Respondent suffered as a result of the accident.
                    In our view, insufficient consideration was given by him to the significant
                    recovery made by the Respondent. Accordingly, we were of the view that there was
                    no real basis for the Judge to increase the award for pain, suffering and loss
                    of amenities. We therefore reinstated the award made by the AR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the light of the considerations set out
                    above, we allowed the appeal in part, to the extent that we restored the
                    AR’s awards for loss of earning capacity and for pain and suffering
                    arising from the head injuries. As the Appellant had only succeeded partially in
                    this appeal, we ordered that each party was to bear his/her own costs of the
                    appeal.</p>
