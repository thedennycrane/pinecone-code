<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of
    the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The importance of
     granularly examining the facts in determining the outcome of contested
     criminal proceedings cannot be overstated. Certainly, the importance of
     such intense scrutiny needs no reiteration where sexual offences without
     any objective corroboration are in question. This was indeed the case here
     and this will also explain the need for meticulous attention to the
     detailed facts that constitute the core of the present judgment. As a
     consequence of this scrutiny, significant evidential gaps were revealed.
     This resulted in the present appeal having to be heard in two tranches
     whilst further evidence was sought. As we shall see, this exercise was not
     a wholly successful one although the new facts that were unearthed were
     significant in <em>confirming</em> the inadequacy of
     the evidence before this court that (in turn) led to our decision. This,
     then, was one central strand in the present appeal. It was inextricably
     connected with a second.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The second central
     strand consisted in that precious and indispensable “golden thread” which
     runs “[t]hroughout the web of the English Criminal Law” (see <em>per</em> Viscount Sankey LC in the leading House of Lords
     decision of <em>Woolmington v The Director of Public
      Prosecutions</em> [1935] AC 462 at 481) – and, we might add,
     Singapore Criminal Law as well. That “golden thread” is, of course, the
     fundamental principle that the Prosecution bears the legal burden of
     proving its case against the accused (here, the Appellant) <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em>. This principle has been
     stated in the local context in far too many cases to be enumerated here.
     More importantly (and as already mentioned), it is inextricably connected
     to the first central strand simply because the <em>facts</em> are an <em>integral</em> part of
     the process by which the court ascertains whether or not the legal burden
     just referred to has been discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Given the crucial
     importance of the facts in the context of the present appeal and (in
     particular) the detailed analysis that follows, it would be helpful to
     first set out a table of contents to guide the reader, as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Before proceeding to
     consider the salient facts in the detail that is required, a little by way
     of preliminary background is appropriate. Close to three years ago on
     30 April 2009, the Appellant was arrested by the police after his daughter
     (“C1”) dramatically alleged that she had been repeatedly and systematically
     raped by her father over a period of 10 years. She was then 16 years-old.
     The rapes allegedly took place at a one bedroom rental flat where the
     Appellant’s family resided (“the flat”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the High Court, the
     Prosecution proceeded against the Appellant on the following five charges
     (out of a total of nine charges), which will henceforth be referred to as
     the first to fifth charges, respectively:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, [Appellant],</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    sometime in 1999, in [the flat], voluntarily
       had carnal intercourse against the order of nature with [C1]
       (DOB: xx March 1993), to wit, by having the said person perform fellatio
       on you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under
       section 377 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    on one occasion in the period from March 2003
       to May 2003, in [the flat], committed rape on [C1], while she was under
       the age of 14 years, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable
       under section 376(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev
      Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    sometime in June 2003, in [the flat],
       committed rape on [C1], while she was under the age of 14 years, and you
       have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 376(2) of the
       Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    sometime in 2004 (1st occasion) which was
       after 11 March 2004, in [the flat], committed rape on [C1], while she was
       under the age of 14 years, and you have thereby committed an offence
       punishable under section 376(2) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev
       Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    on 29th day of April 2009 at about 2.30pm, in
       the flat, used criminal force on [C1] intending to outrage her modesty,
       to wit, by undoing one button at the front of her blouse, and further, in
       order to facilitate the commission of the said offence, you voluntarily
       caused wrongful restraint to the said complainant, to wit, by grabbing
       her right wrist with your hand, and you have thereby committed an offence
       punishable under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter
      224.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Four other charges for
     fellatio in 2000 and rape in 2004, July 2006 and November 2006 were stood
     down by the Prosecution at the start of the trial. The last charge was
     amended by the trial judge (“the Judge”) at the conclusion of the
     Prosecution’s case by deleting “undoing” and substituting the words
     “attempting to undo.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The trial commenced
     with the Appellant conducting his own defence and speaking through a Malay
     interpreter. On 27 August 2010, after 12 Prosecution witnesses had
     testified, including C1, at the first tranche of the trial (“the first
     tranche of the trial”), the Appellant informed the court that his family
     wished to engage legal representation for him. The Appellant’s father
     confirmed that the family would be instructing lawyers to represent the
     Appellant. The trial was thus adjourned for the family to do
    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 30 August 2010,
     newly-appointed counsel confirmed that they had been instructed to act for
     the Appellant and applied for time to study the notes of evidence and to
     take further instructions. They asked the Judge if they could recall, for
     the purpose of cross-examination only, four Prosecution witnesses: PW6
     (SSSGT Mohamed Lathiff) (“Lathiff”), PW9 (Dr Cindy Pang), PW10 (the ex-wife
     of the Appellant and mother of C1) (“the mother”) and PW12 (“C1”). The
     Prosecution had no objection to the recall of these witnesses. Accordingly,
     the Judge acceded to Appellant’s counsel’s request and adjourned the
     trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The trial resumed on
     3 November 2010 and took place over seven days spanning the period of
     3 November 2010 to 22 November 2010 (“the second tranche of the trial”). On
     the same day, the Judge convicted the Appellant of all five charges that
     had been proceeded with. The Prosecution then withdrew the remaining four
     charges pursuant to s 177 of the previous Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
     1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC (Cap 68)”) and the Appellant was granted a discharge not
     amounting to an acquittal on those charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 23 November 2010,
     the Appellant was sentenced as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Judge ordered the
     imprisonment terms for the s 377 charge and two of the s 376(2) charges to
     run consecutively with effect from the date of the arrest, <em>ie</em>, 30 April 2009, with the other two imprisonment
     terms to run concurrently with them. The total imprisonment term was
     therefore 29 years. The Appellant was given the maximum of 24 strokes of
     the cane. The grounds for the Judge’s decision, which were released on
     21 December 2010, are to be found in <em>Public Prosecutor v
      AOF</em> [2010] SGHC 366 (“the GD”).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Appellant was
     born in November 1975. He is now 37 years old. Prior to his arrest, he was
     residing in the flat with the wife and three children. He married the wife
     in 1992. Their three children comprise two daughters and a son. The eldest
     child, C1, is the complainant in the present charges against the Appellant.
     She was born in March 1993 and is now 19 years-old. The second daughter
     (“C2”) was born in 1997 and is now 15 years-old. The son (“C3”) was born in
     2001 and is now 11 years-old. The marriage appears to have been an unhappy
     one with the mother having made at least one police report concerning an
     alleged assault by the Appellant. On that occasion, the Appellant was
     warned by the investigation officer (“IO”) that his wife could have
     obtained a Personal Protection Order as a result. By the Appellant’s own
     admission, he continued to assault his wife even after this police report
     was made (see below at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and
      <a href="#p1_227">[227]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In February 2010, the
     Appellant divorced his wife by consent in the Syariah Court through
     matrimonial proceedings commenced by her. The Appellant was in custody in
     respect of the present case at that particular point in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Shortly after, on
     12 July 2010, the mother and Lathiff travelled to Batam together with the
     mother’s brother where the couple apparently married. Coincidentally,
     Lathiff, was the Duty Investigation Officer (“DIO”) who attended to the
     mother and C1 at Ang Mo Kio Police Division when they reported the alleged
     rapes by the Appellant on 29 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s case at the trial
    below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Judge has set out
     comprehensively the Prosecution’s case in the GD (at [7]–[42]). We therefore set out a summarised version as
     follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">C1’s testimony at the first tranche of the
    trial</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The first charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     C1 told the court
     that the Appellant started engaging in sexual acts with her in 1999 when
     she was 6 years-old and still in kindergarten. The first alleged incident
     occurred at around midnight in the living room of the flat when C2 was
     asleep in the bedroom and the mother was on night shift work. C3 was not
     yet born. C1 was sleeping with C2 in the bedroom when the Appellant came to
     wake her up. The Appellant then pulled her up and she followed him to the
     living room. He told her to sit next to him on the mattress in the living
     room. C1 was in her pyjama dress. The Appellant lay down on the mattress,
     wearing only his shorts. The television was on but the house lights were
     off. A while later, the Appellant pulled down his shorts and told C1 to
     hold his penis. When she did so, the penis was erect. He then asked her to
     suck his penis. She complied for a few minutes and noticed “white liquid”
     coming out from the penis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     C1 did not tell
     anyone, including her mother, about the incident as she did not know at the
     time that what had happened was wrong and how to tell her mother or anyone
     about it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The second charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     One night, sometime
     after C1’s tenth birthday, between March 2003 and June 2003, the Appellant
     asked her to follow him to watch television in the living room. C1 was
     watching television in the bedroom at the time and both her siblings were
     asleep. The mother was not at home as she was on night shift
    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     When C1 went out to
     the living room, the television screen was showing a naked man on top of a
     naked woman. C1 did not understand what they were doing. She sat down next
     to the Appellant while he lay on the mattress, wearing only shorts. C1 was
     in her pyjama dress. The Appellant then exposed his penis and told her to
     hold it. As she did so, she felt the Appellant insert his finger into her
     vagina. She felt pain and tried to push his hand away. He then told her to
     suck his penis and she complied. After a while, he made her lie down on the
     mattress and removed her panties. He then held her legs apart and inserted
     his penis into her vagina. She felt him moving back and forth. She felt a
     lot of pain and tried to push him away but he was too strong. After he
     ejaculated on her stomach, he told her to wash up and go to sleep. She
     followed all the instructions given as she was afraid of the
     Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The third charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     During the school
     holidays in June 2003, much the same things happened in the living room as
     in the second charge. C2 and C3 were sleeping in the bedroom and the mother
     was working the night shift. In the living room, the Appellant got C1 to
     hold his penis while he inserted his finger into C1’s vagina. He then asked
     her to suck his penis before inserting his penis into her vagina. C1 tried
     to resist by pushing him away but he was too strong. He then ejaculated on
     her stomach and told her to wash up and go to sleep.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The day incident</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     C1 also testified
     about another incident that took place in the flat in 2004 (which was not,
     however, the subject of any charge). She claimed that one day when she and
     C2 were in the bedroom, the Appellant went in and asked C2 to go out as he
     wanted to help massage C1’s back. After C2 left the bedroom, the Appellant
     closed the room door and latched it. He then asked C1 to perform fellatio
     on him. She recalled this incident as it happened a few months after her
     puberty and she was having cramps at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The fourth charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After her
     eleventh birthday in March 2004, the Appellant raped C1 twice that year.
     She reached puberty around May that year. Consequently, one incident of
     rape took place <em>before</em> her puberty, which was
     the subject of the fourth charge, and the other occurred <em>after</em> her puberty, this was the subject of one of the charges
     that was stood down by the Prosecution and eventually withdrawn at the end
     of the trial. Both rapes happened in much the same sequence as the earlier
     ones described above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>–<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In 2004, C1 attended
     sex education classes at school. She claimed that it was then that she had
     realized that what had happened between her and the Appellant was wrong.
     She contemplated telling the mother about what the Appellant had done but
     decided against it as she did not want the mother to be unhappy. This was
     because she was afraid that the mother would confront the Appellant and
     that he would beat the mother up, as he had done on other occasions when
     they quarrelled. C1 also did not know how to explain to the mother about
     the incidents. She also did not tell her teachers or her classmates as she
     did not know how to do so and was afraid that they would not believe
     her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Events in 2006</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In 2006, when C1 was
     in secondary one, the Appellant raped her again. In April 2006, she ran
     away from home. During the three days away from home before the mother
     found her, she stayed with her friend’s god-sister. She had hoped that her
     running away from home would show the Appellant that she did not want to
     continue having sex with him. However, she kept this reason to herself. As
     a result of this incident, the Appellant punished C1 by having her
     “grounded” and did not permit her to go to school for some
    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     C1 also tried to
     avoid further sexual incidents with the Appellant after the last rape which
     occurred in 2006. She would return to the flat after school only if the
     mother was at home. Otherwise, she would go to the Ang Mo Kio library and
     remain there until 8pm to 10pm. When she went to bed, she would lie next to
     C2 so that, if the Appellant attempted to pull her away, she would hug C2
     and cause her to wake up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     C1 affirmed
     unequivocally that she did not have sex with any other person besides the
     Appellant. This is an issue that goes to her credibility that we will
     address below (see Issue 1 below, at <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a>–<a href="#p1_172">[172]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">C1’s diary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     C1 claimed that she
     used to keep two diaries while she was in primary school. The yellow one
     was for her general matters while the purple one, bought when she was in
     primary four or five, was to record the sexual abuse by the Appellant up to
     2006. She recorded the dates of the incidents, what happened on those days
     and her feelings about them and would refer to the diary two or three times
     every fortnight. Both diaries were supposedly lost while she was in
     secondary two or three, allegedly thrown away with other books by the
     mother during spring cleaning of the flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">C1’s disclosure of the sexual assaults to
    C2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     C1 further testified
     that she had told C2 about the sexual abuse while they were staying with
     their grandmother during the school holidays sometime in 2007 or 2008. One
     night, she asked C2 whether she knew the meaning of “sex”. C2 said that it
     meant the penis was inside the vagina. C1 then asked her whether she
     believed that “daddy” had done that to her. C2 appeared shocked and was a
     little incredulous at first. She asked C1 why she had not informed “mummy”
     about it. C1 replied that it was not the right time to tell her yet as
     their parents were quarrelling and she did not want to add to the mother’s
     problems. C2 asked her whether she would like her to help in telling the
     mother but C1 said that she would tell the mother when it was time to do
     so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The fifth charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The fifth charge,
     along with the arrest of the Appellant, came about in the following manner.
     A few days before 29 April 2009, the mother and the three children moved
     out of the flat after the mother and the Appellant had quarrelled over
     their finances. They went to stay with the children’s maternal grandmother
     in Yishun. Moving out with the mother after their parents had quarrelled
     was not something new to the children. In fact, the mother and the
     Appellant quarrelled frequently over money and the Appellant’s alleged
     extra-marital affairs with various “Indonesian ladies”. These quarrels
     would often turn violent with the mother having to make a police report
     more than two to three years ago. On that occasion, the Appellant was
     warned by the IO that his wife could have obtained a Personal Protection
     Order as a result. These bouts of violence went on even after the police
     report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Sometime after 2pm on
     29 April 2009, C1 returned to the flat alone to collect some items which
     she needed for school. According to C1, the Appellant later returned to the
     flat and, noticing that C1 was in the bedroom, went in to talk to her and
     sat a few feet away from her. He grabbed her right wrist with his left hand
     and tried to undo the first button (the one just below the collar button)
     of her school blouse. During the struggle, C1 managed to use her mobile
     phone to call the mother to inform her that she was leaving the flat to
     meet the mother at Ang Mo Kio Central for shopping as had been arranged.
     The mother recalled that C1 was speaking in a trembling voice and had
     sounded sad. As a result of this call, the Appellant stopped his actions.
     C1 then left the flat quickly and went to meet the mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     When they met, the
     mother noticed that C1 looked like she had been crying although she had
     earlier sounded delighted to go shopping. C1 burst out in tears when C3
     asked her why she was crying. She managed to utter only the words, “daddy,
     daddy” when the mother asked why she was crying. The mother then asked her
     whether the Appellant had scolded her or had beaten her up. She told the
     mother in Malay that the Appellant “wanted to do it again”. When the mother
     asked her to elaborate, she used the Malay word <em>“main”</em> (meaning “play”) to explain that he had wanted sex. The
     mother asked her whether the Appellant had put his penis into her vagina
     and she confirmed that he did. The mother then asked her to swear upon God
     that what she was telling her was true. When C1 did so, the mother brought
     her to Ang Mo Kio South Neighbourhood Police Centre (“the NPC”) in a taxi.
     In the taxi, the mother asked C1 to re-affirm that everything she said was
     the truth and C1 did so. According to the mother’s testimony, she asked C1
     whether it was <em>“sedap”</em> (or nice) and C1
     replied that it was not. She asked this question to determine whether C1
     was a willing participant in the sex acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At the NPC, they
     approached a female officer who observed that C1 was crying. The female
     officer tried to calm her down. C1 informed the female officer that she had
     been raped by her father and wanted to lodge a police report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The
     female officer then telephoned Senior Staff Sergeant Lathiff, who was the
     DIO of Ang Mo Kio Police Division that evening. Lathiff instructed the
     female officer to lodge a police report for C1 and to ask the mother and C1
     to go to the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters (“the DHQ”) to meet
     him. Before leaving for the DHQ, a male police officer at the NPC typed out
     C1’s First Information Report (“FIR”) which C1 signed. The section,
     entitled “Brief details” in the FIR, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sometime in year 2006, I was raped by my father one [name of
      Appellant and his NRIC no.] at [the flat].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Under the heading,
     “Date/Time of Incident”, it was stated, “12/07/2006 23:55 –
     12/07/2006 23:55”. The date and time of the said report were stated as
     “29/04/2009 16:48”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     At the DHQ, Lathiff
     interviewed C1 and her mother separately and recorded their contents in his
     investigation diary. Later that evening, Station Inspector Chandra Seakeran
     (“SI Chandra”) of the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch (“SSCB”) arrived and
     interviewed C1. The next day, the police arrested the Appellant at the
     flat. He has been in custody since.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">C1’s testimony at the second tranche of the
    trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     C1 was one of four
     Prosecution witnesses recalled for cross-examination. C1 agreed that she
     was not angry with the Appellant for quarrelling with the mother over money
     matters but was angry over the Appellant’s alleged extra-marital
      affairs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> C1 agreed that while she had three
     boyfriends since secondary one, she did not have had sexual intercourse
     with any of these boys.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Appellant’s
     defence counsel (“defence counsel”) suggested to C1 that her allegations
     about the incidents of sex were all false. In particular, defence counsel
     suggested to C1 that she was fabricating the allegations against the
     Appellant in order to send him to prison, as he was a strict father, had
     treated C2 better than she, had extra-marital affairs and had beat up the
     mother. C1 denied that she was lying about the sexual assaults and
     disagreed with the suggestions made by defence counsel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, C1 conceded
     under cross examination that she had lied to the mother on two occasions.
     On the first occasion, when she ran away from home in 2006 and was located
     by the mother subsequently, C1 lied that she had been staying outdoors when
     she was actually in a friend’s home. C1 explained that she did not want to
     get the friends who sheltered her into trouble as the mother had made a
     police report about her disappearance. On the second occasion, when the
     mother told her to return home and not stay in the library, she lied that
     she had to look for materials there. C1 explained that she did not want to
     return to the flat earlier as she was afraid of being alone with the
     Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In respect of her
     relationship with Lathiff, C1 denied having addressed him as <em>“Baba”</em> or father in Malay. She said that Lathiff had
     only advised her about school work and her future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">C1’s HSA statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In re-examination,
     the Prosecution brought to the attention of the court the statement C1 had
     given to Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) officers (“the HSA statement”)
     regarding a separate, ongoing police investigation into the mother’s and
     Lathiff’s alleged involvement in the theft of cough syrup from the clinic
     where the mother used to work as a nurse (“the theft of cough syrup
     investigation”). It should be noted that Lathiff is the same person who was
     the DIO in C1’s rape investigation. Of relevance is the fact that this
     statement was recorded on 22 September 2010, between the first tranche and
     the second tranche of the Appellant’s trial. It was commendably brought to
     the court’s attention during the Prosecution’s re-examination of C1 when
     she was recalled as a witness on 15 November 2010. When questioned by the
     Prosecution, C1 denied giving the answers recorded in the HSA statement. In
     contradiction to what the HSA statement recorded, she denied telling the
     HSA officers that she believed that the mother had married Lathiff in Batam
     and that, at first, she called the mother’s new husband “uncle” but
     subsequently called him “<em>Baba</em>”. The HSA
     statement also recorded C1 as stating that the mother had known Lathiff
     since June 2009, this was shortly after he had been the (initial)
     investigating officer looking into C1’s police report. She maintained her
     position that she did not say those things about the mother and Lathiff
     despite being repeatedly warned by the Prosecution and the Judge about the
     consequences of giving false testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     C1 claimed that she
     was working as an event coordinator for a fast food outlet and was in the
     midst of a client’s birthday party at the client’s home when some HSA
     officers telephoned her and requested to meet her for five minutes. She
     agreed and went down to the ground floor of the block of flats where she
     had hurriedly answered some questions and then signed a statement after it
     was read to her as she had to rush back to the party. She signed that
     statement (<em>viz</em>, the HSA statement) as the HSA
     officers had told her that the HSA statement could be of assistance to the
     mother. She adamantly maintained in court that the contents of the
     statement were untrue and that she had merely called Lathiff “uncle” and
     not “<em>Baba</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Both defence counsel
     and the Prosecution agreed initially that the HSA officers who recorded
     C1’s statement be called to testify. However, the next day, the Prosecution
     informed the court that it was not calling the officers but would take the
     position that the HSA statement was indeed made by C1. The Prosecution did
     not wish to have the whole statement admitted in evidence as it was the
     subject of ongoing investigations. On that basis, defence counsel accepted
     the Prosecution’s position and agreed to confine their questioning to the
     portion of the HSA statement already on the record.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Nonetheless, the Prosecution’s submission
     was that whether C1 had addressed Lathiff as “<em>Baba</em>” “<em>is clearly a collateral matter, a
      matter that is not central to the issue before the
      Court.</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Defence counsel disagreed and submitted
     that it was relevant to discredit C1’s testimony and demonstrate whether
     there had been any form of collusion among Lathiff, C1 and the
      mother.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> When C1 returned to the
     witness stand, she explained that she was sad and concerned that the
     investigators were alleging that her mother was involved in the alleged
     theft of cough syrup. She maintained that she had called Lathiff “uncle”
     and not “<em>Baba</em>” and that she did not know
     whether calling him “<em>Baba</em>” would be damaging
     to her mother’s case or not. She also maintained that she had no reason to
     fabricate the charges of rape and sexual abuse by the Appellant and that
     she had not discussed the case with Lathiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The medical reports</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On 5 May 2009, the
     Appellant was examined by a doctor from Changi General Hospital and found
     not to have been suffering from erectile dysfunction. On 18 and 25 May
     2009, the Appellant was examined by Dr Seng Kok Han, a psychiatrist from
     the Institute of Mental Health, and was found to have had no mental
     illness. The Appellant informed the psychiatrist that he had never had
     sexual intercourse or any other sexual activity with C1. He also told the
     psychiatrist that, although he was not close to C1, they did not have major
     conflicts and he did not know why C1 had accused him of rape. During the
     second session with the psychiatrist, the Appellant was tearful when he
     said that he might plead guilty in order not to get C1 into
    trouble.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On 3 June 2009, C1
     was examined by Dr Cindy Pang (“Dr Pang”) of the Department of Obstetrics
     and Gynaecology, Singapore General Hospital. C1 informed Dr Pang that she
     had her menarche at age 11 and provided a general history of the alleged
     sexual acts between the Appellant and her. Dr Pang noted that C1’s hymen
     “... was deficient posteriorly, with old tears at the 2 and 9 o’clock
     position, suggestive of previous penetration.” Dr Pang explained that when
     she interviewed C1, she had focused on the history pertaining to
     penetration and not on non-penetrative episodes. She opined that it was
     unlikely that the tears were caused by sports or dancing and that they
     could not have occurred unless there had been penetration by some object.
     In her view, a posteriorly deficient hymen was not more susceptible to
     tears compared to a normal one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     C1 was examined by
     Dr Lim Choon Guan (“Dr Lim”), a psychiatrist in the Department of Child and
     Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, on 5 June 2009. C1 gave
     Dr Lim a general history of the sexual acts allegedly committed by the
     Appellant on her. Dr Lim noted that C1 was able to give a clear and
     detailed account of the alleged events. He also noted that she would become
     teary-eyed at times but was still able to hold her composure, that her mood
     was not depressed and that her thoughts were coherent and logical. C1 was
     assessed to be in the average range of intellectual functioning. The
     psychiatrist opined that C1 was not suffering from any major mental illness
     and did not exhibit any symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder, was fit
     to testify in court, and was aware of the nature and quality of the acts
     she had alleged against the Appellant. Dr Lim also interviewed the mother
     on the same day. He recorded that she had declined the institute’s request
     to obtain a report on C1 from her school. C1 was referred for counselling
     with the Child Guidance Clinic’s medical social worker but did not turn up
     for the appointment on 25 June 2009. When cross-examined, C1 claimed that
     her mother did not inform her about this further appointment. When further
     questioned on why her mother did not accede to Dr Lim’s request for C1’s
     school report, C1 agreed with defence counsel’s suggestion that the report
     would perhaps expose her disciplinary problems at school.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> However, when it was put to her later in
     cross-examination, C1 denied having discipline problems before and after
     April 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The mother’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In respect of her
     divorce from the Appellant, the mother testified that she had commenced
     proceedings in the Syariah Court because she could not tolerate the abuse
     by the Appellant and his financial irresponsibility towards their family,
     and also because of the allegations that he had raped their daughter.
     However, she agreed that the divorce was granted without the court
     requiring her to prove her allegations and that the Appellant had merely
     pronounced the “<em>talak</em>” in order to effect the
     divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The mother explained
     that she had left the flat around 4pm to 5pm for her night shift work
     during the marriage. She testified that she had changed primary schools for
     C1 not because C1 had disciplinary problems in the former school but purely
     because the former school was further away from the flat and that
     travelling to and from school cost money while the new school was within
     walking distance. When C1 was missing from home, the mother took leave to
     search for her and, when someone finally told her where C1 was, her only
     concern was to bring her home and not to question her about why she had run
     away from home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The mother was
     cross-examined about her relationship with Lathiff, a married man. She was
     asked whether she had asked the Appellant’s sister and her husband to
     arrange a secret marriage for her and Lathiff in Batam. The mother claimed
     that she became friends with Lathiff only some two months after C1’s police
     report was made. Lathiff called to ask how she was coping and had asked her
     out for a drink. She admitted that she had invited Lathiff to the flat and
     that he had driven her to Ang Mo Kio Central in a police patrol car before.
     Lathiff merely advised her children to be obedient and to study hard. He
     did not try to coach C1 or C2 concerning their testimony in court. She
     denied being in a romantic relationship. She stated that she told the
     Appellant’s sister to arrange the secret marriage in Batam merely to anger
     and hurt the Appellant’s family by letting them know that she was marrying
     someone better than the Appellant. The mother categorically denied that a
     marriage had been entered into between her and Lathiff. In July 2010, she
     did go on a one-day shopping trip to Batam with her brother and Lathiff.
     Lathiff’s wife was supposed to join them but could not because of work
     commitments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lathiff’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Lathiff, who had been
     transferred to other duties because of the theft of cough syrup
     investigation, testified that after he had met C1 and the mother on
     29 April 2009, he interviewed C1 for about an hour and spoke to the mother
     separately. His role was to ascertain whether the allegations of rape were
     made out or not. C1 was crying and could hardly speak. After she had calmed
     down, she narrated her story to Lathiff who then informed the SSCB. When
     the officers from the SSCB arrived later that evening, they took over the
     investigations and Lathiff was not involved in the case from then on. It
     was only some two months later that he had decided to call the mother to
     befriend her. He claimed that they did not know each other before 29 April
     2009. He agreed that he had been to the flat but the children were home on
     those occasions. He merely counselled them and told them to be obedient.
     His contact with the mother and the children was on a personal basis and
     had nothing to do with the investigations in this case. He could not recall
     whether he had given the mother a lift in a police patrol car. On one such
     visit to the flat, he had met the Appellant’s sister and her husband. The
     mother told Lathiff that she had informed the Appellant’s sister and her
     husband about their supposed wedding as a ploy to hurt the Appellant’s
     family. He too denied that a marriage had been entered into between him and
     the mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">C2’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     C2’s testimony
     covered three separate episodes which are summarised as
      follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first
      episode (“the first episode”) was in 2006 when C2 was about 9 years old.
      The Appellant went into the bedroom and told her and C3 to go outside. C1
      was asleep and the mother was not home. C2 was told to close the bedroom
      door. C2 did so but felt uneasy. She waited in the living room and did not
      dare to open the bedroom door as she was afraid of the Appellant. He
      emerged from the bedroom about half an hour later. When C2 entered the
      bedroom, C1 was seated on the bed watching television. Sometime after that
      day, C2 asked C1 what was going on in the room that day but received no
      answer from her.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second episode (“the second episode”) happened at
      night in 2006, when the three children were sleeping in the bedroom. C2
      was awakened by some movement on the bed. She saw the Appellant on top of
      C1. C2 turned away towards C3 as she was afraid of the Appellant. He was
      not wearing any shirt but C2 could not see if his shorts were on. The
      mother was out working that night. Subsequently, the Appellant left the
      bedroom. C2 did not ask C1, nor did she tell anyone about this
      incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third episode (“the third episode”) happened one
      afternoon in 2008. C1 told C2 that, with regard to the first episode when
      C2 was asked to leave the bedroom, the Appellant had touched C1’s vagina
      and her body. C2 was shocked to hear this. Both of them cried. C2 told C1
      she hated the Appellant for this and would treat him as an uncle and not
      as their father. C1 told her that the mother did not know about all this
      and that she would tell her when the time was right. It was C2’s testimony
      that this took place at their home.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s case at the trial
    below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s version of events at the
    trial below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Appellant’s
     defence to the charges consisted in a complete denial that any sexual
     contact had taken place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     When asked by the
     Prosecution why he had not challenged C1’s allegations during the first
     tranche of the trial despite the court’s guidance, he said that he did not
     know how to challenge her evidence. He explained that when he told the
     psychiatrist that he might plead guilty in order not to get C1 into trouble
     (see above at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>), he meant that his
     daughter had made a false report against him and he might choose to admit
     guilt rather than have her prosecuted for making a false report. He was
     “willing to take over her punishment”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> It was
     not an expression of remorse over what he had allegedly done to her. He was
     sad when he heard C1’s testimony in court, wondering why she was making
     such allegations and who might be behind them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Appellant,
     through defence counsel, also alleged that the mother and Lathiff were in a
     romantic relationship and that they had colluded to bring false allegations
     against him. To support this argument, he referred to the testimony of his
     sister, his sister’s husband and his father.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The sister’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In her
     examination-in-chief, the Appellant’s sister (“the sister”) testified that
     the mother previously had a “close” relationship with her and considered
     the mother her “own sister”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> The
     sister used to send her children to the mother’s flat from 2006 to May
      2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> This stopped soon
     after the sister realised that the general atmosphere in the flat had
     changed. From April to June 2009, the sister had been told that the
     Appellant was out working whenever she sent her children to the mother’s
     flat for babysitting on the weekends.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The mother finally told the sister about
     the rape charges sometime in June 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The sister stated
     that the mother apologised to her and had used the Malay word <em>“rogol”</em> (which means rape in English). The mother also
     told the sister that she did not know how to express it to the Appellant’s
     parents as she was afraid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On 27 June
      2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> the sister, the
     Appellant’s brother and parents (along with C1, C2, C3 and the mother) met
     at the Appellant’s parents’ flat (“the 27 June 2009 meeting”). The children
     were sent to a room while the meeting was held in the living room. The
     sister heard the mother say to the Appellant’s parents that if the
     Appellant was willing to divorce her, she would withdraw the
      case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In a separate
     incident in October 2009, the mother told the sister that she had first met
     Lathiff when she reported the loss of her Identity Card (“IC”) to the
     police. When asked when this took place, the sister replied that the mother
     “did not say”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The mother also
     shared that Lathiff was a married man who lived with his four children and
     wife. The mother asked the sister for her advice on whether she should
     become Lathiff’s second wife<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and asked if the sister’s husband could
     speak to Lathiff about the prospect of the mother and him getting married
     in Batam. Shortly after, the sister’s husband made arrangements for the
     marriage in Batam to take place on 25 December 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, though, the mother
     telephoned the sister to inform her that the marriage was cancelled because
     Lathiff and the mother had a “misunderstanding.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In March 2010, the
     sister and her husband met Lathiff, for the first and only time at the
     mother’s flat. C1 and C3 were also present.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> As Lathiff, the mother, the sister and her
     husband were all leaving the flat at the same time, the sister and her
     husband offered the mother a lift in their car. The mother declined, saying
     that Lathiff had brought his police car. The sister later saw the mother
     being driven by Lathiff in his police car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The sister testified that the mother, C1,
     C2 and C3 had a close relationship with Latiff. They conversed over the
     telephone and C1 would sometimes ask Lathiff to buy chocolate while C2
     would ask for ice-cream. C2 and C3 addressed Lathiff as <em>Baba.</em> The sister knew that the Appellant’s children spoke to
     Lathiff over the phone because she had overheard one such telephone
     conversation while she was staying over at the flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Sometime in May 2010,
     the mother informed the sister that Lathiff and she had gone through with
     the Batam marriage on 3 May 2010 with the help of the mother’s
      brother.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> The sister asked the
     mother whether she had obtained the consent of Lathiff’s first wife. The
     mother said that the first wife had not given her consent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The sister was shown the wedding ring,
     photograph and marriage certificate which had been issued in Batam. The
     mother also told the sister that she had received her divorce certificate
     in March 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Prosecution began
     its cross-examination by expressly stating that it was not accepting these
     aspects of the sister’s testimony:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The prosecution is not, okay, accepting what you are telling the
      Court to be the case, you know, about <em>your interactions
       with your sister-in-law, about Lathiff and all, okay.</em> But I’m
      proceeding, all right, with my questions and assuming what you are telling
      the Court is true, okay? [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Nonetheless, the
     Prosecution failed to specifically challenge the precise allegations in the
     sister’s evidence on her observations of the interactions between the
     mother, her children and Lathiff. At this juncture, we pause to note
     parenthetically that the sister clarified during cross-examination that at
     no time did C1 or the mother state that the allegations against the
     Appellant were false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Judge, however,
     did not adequately evaluate this evidence contextually (see below at
      <a href="#p1_81">[81]</a>). Pertinently, the further
     evidence that has surfaced in the course of this appeal confirms the
     accuracy of the sister’s testimony on some of these points.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The sister’s husband’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The sister’s
     husband’s testimony was that Lathiff and the mother had an established
     romantic relationship. Sometime at the end of 2009, the sister told him
     that the mother had wanted him to make preparations for her marriage to
     Lathiff in Batam. He had agreed to do so and contacted his friends to make
     the necessary preparations. Some months later, Lathiff and the mother told
     him that they were not able to perform the marriage there. A few months
     later, he heard from his wife that Lathiff and the mother had been married
     in Batam.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In relation to the
     March 2010 meeting at the mother’s flat (see above at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>), he observed that “... Lathiff was sort of
     a strong person, influential, and [C1] was afraid of him. And he appeared
     to be very instructive [to C1]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> He also mentioned that Lathiff had referred
     to himself as <em>Baba</em> to the children. He
     corroborated the sister’s account that he had, together with the sister,
     seen Lathiff ferry the mother in his police car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     He had asked for
     permission from the mother to speak to C1 about the allegation against the
     Appellant but the mother had refused to allow him to talk to C1. Upon
     cross-examination, the sister’s husband clarified that the mother and C1
     had never said that the police report was false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s father’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Appellant’s final
     witness was his father. The Appellant’s father claimed that he first came
     to know about the allegations of rape during the 27 June 2009 meeting at
     his flat (see above at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>). At the
     meeting, the mother wanted to tell those present why the Appellant had been
     arrested. The Appellant’s father was not allowed to ask her questions but
     was only permitted to listen to what she had to say. The mother said that
     her elder brother had taken both the mother and C1 to make the police
      report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The mother had a copy of the
     Appellant’s birth certificate and, with that, she had access to the
     Appellant in prison. The mother also stated that, if the Appellant divorced
     her, she would withdraw all the charges against him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The Appellant’s father asked the mother
     whether it was true that the Appellant had raped C1. The mother kept silent
     and told the Appellant’s father that he could not ask C1 about this because
     “[b]eing the mother, she knew what it’s all about.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Appellant’s
     father testified that, he found the mother to be “very aggressive” against
     and “cruel” to the Appellant during their marriage. The mother would come
     to see the Appellant’s father every month for financial help as the
     Appellant was unemployed. The Appellant’s mother would give between $30 and
     $50 whereas the Appellant’s father would not give her any money as he was
     not on good terms with the mother and did not like to see her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Appellant’s
     father also testified that even before the Appellant’s arrest, he would
     only be able to talk to C1 for about 10 minutes before the mother would
     take her away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     During
      cross-examination,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> the Appellant’s
     father stated that the mother had told him during the 27 June 2009 meeting
     that she wanted to send the Appellant to prison.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The Prosecution noted that the
     Appellant’s father did not mention this during his examination in-chief and
     neither had the mother claimed to have made such a statement. Nevertheless,
     the Appellant’s father conceded that the mother or C1 did not at any time
     say that the police report was false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Judge’s detailed
     reasons are set out in his GD (at [60]–[73]). To begin
     with, the Judge was mindful that the allegations in this case were based
     solely on the testimony of the Appellant. He observed (see the GD at
      [60]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [With] allegations of this nature, the crucial evidence often comes
      from the alleged victim only and the court must be aware of the dangers of
      convicting solely on that testimony, bearing in mind the ease with which
      allegations of sexual assault may be fabricated and the concomitant
      difficulty of rebutting such allegations (see the Court of Appeal’s
      decision in <em>PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed
       Mallik</em> [2008] 1 SLR 601).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">C1’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Judge then
     proceeded to give his evaluation of the demeanour and testimony of C1 (see
     the GD at [62]–[64]). In particular, he noted (see the GD
     at [62]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>C1 appeared to me to be a forthright person, not
       given to exaggerations or embellishments.</em> She spoke simply and
      did not appear to have been coached or “tutored” (the word used by defence
      counsel in reference to Lathiff) in her evidence at all, whether during
      the first or the resumed hearing. I was satisfied that she understood the
      gravity of what she was saying in court about her father and knew the
      importance of telling the truth. Allowance must obviously be given for the
      fact that some of the alleged incidents occurred many years ago when she
      was much younger. It would therefore not be possible to recall with
      precision every detail of each occurrence. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge went on to state (see the GD at [64]) that C1’s account of the events on 29 April 2009:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [w]as particularly clear and cogent, probably due to the fact that
      it was the most recent incident involving the Appellant and she was more
      mature by then. It was also the trigger event that led to the police
      report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     However, the Judge
     identified two concerns regarding C1’s testimony. The first related to the
     two diaries that C1 alleged she kept but were somehow lost around 2007 or
     2008 (see above at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>). Defence
     counsel argued that these diaries did not exist because the mother could
     not have discarded them without so much as browsing through them. The Judge
     did not think C1 was lying about the loss of the diaries and suggested that
     perhaps the mother was careless in disposing of them without much thought.
     However, as both diaries were missing, the Judge did not place any weight
     on C1’s evidence that the alleged sexual assaults were detailed by her in
     one of them (see the GD at [69]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The second and much
     more important concern related to the HSA statement regarding the ongoing
     police investigation into the mother’s and Lathiff’s involvement in the
     theft of cough syrup investigation (see above at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>–<a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>). The Judge’s
     findings on this issue (see the GD at [70]–[72]) are highly
     pertinent to our later discussion on the possibility of collusion as well
     as C1’s credibility and we therefore reproduce it, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... This was the only time in C1’s testimony in court that she paused
      hard and long before answering any questions, including those posed by the
      court. Despite her denials about the accuracy of the said statement
      regarding how she addressed Lathiff, the prosecution has accepted that she
      did give the answers as recorded and that she did refer to Lathiff in more
      recent times as “<em>Baba”</em> or father.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A quick perusal of the questions and answers from question 8
      onwards [of the HSA statement] would show that the answers purportedly
      made by her <em>were clearly detrimental to her mother in
       the investigations regarding the cough syrup</em>. I need not rule
      on the voluntariness or the accuracy of this statement in this trial in
      view of the position taken by the prosecution regarding its own witness’
      previous statement. <em>I highlighted the rest of the
       contents of this statement merely to explain why I believed C1 was not
       willing to acknowledge her own statement</em>. By this time, C1
      obviously realized that if her mother were to get into any trouble with
      the law, she and her siblings would be left to fend for themselves. She
      was thus extremely reluctant to accept the statement as having been made
      by her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I reconsidered her veracity in the light of this
       new development and concluded that while she was not entirely forthright
       on this score, she was completely truthful in her testimony regarding the
       charges</em>. As explained above, it was perfectly understandable
      why she sought to disavow the statement. This of course attracted the
      criticism that she was capable of telling an untruth where it suited her
      purposes. <em>Nevertheless, bearing in mind the serious
       charges that the Appellant faced and the burden on the prosecution to
       prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, I still held the firm belief that
       C1 was telling the truth about the sexual assaults. This was so even if
       the mother and Lathiff were not completely upfront about their
       relationship....</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Collusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The Judge also
     proffered a number of reasons for rejecting the case by the defence that C1
     had colluded with her mother, and possibly Lathiff, to bring a false
     complaint against the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     First, it was not as
     if C1 had returned to the flat on 29 April 2009 in order to set a trap for
     the Appellant. After all, as the Appellant testified, C1 was also back at
     the flat on the two days immediately before that date and nothing happened
     (see the GD at [64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Secondly, C1’s
     genuine distress after the confrontation with the Appellant in the flat was
     also noted by the police officers who saw her that day (see the GD at
      [64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Thirdly, although the
     prosecution accepted that C1 did refer to Lathiff in more recent times as
      “<em>Baba</em>”, her “extreme reluctance” to
     acknowledge this at trial could be explained by the fact that “if her
     mother were to get into any trouble with the law [over the HSA
     investigation], she and her siblings would be left to fend for themselves”
     (see the GD at [71]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Fourthly, even if the
     mother and Lathiff were not completely upfront about their relationship,
     the Judge accepted that any relationship between them developed only a
     couple of months or so after the police report had been made by C1 (see the
     GD at [72]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Fifthly, the Judge
     did not detect any hint that Lathiff, despite being the apparent father
     figure to the Appellant’s children, had sought in any way to influence C1
     or C2 in their testimony in court (see the GD at [72]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s cross-examination of
    C1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The Judge appeared to
     place considerable weight on the fact that the Appellant, who at the time
     was appearing in-person, was unable to put any questions to C1 about the
     alleged sexual assaults. The Judge observed (at [65]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The accused’s inability to put any questions to C1 about the alleged
      sexual assaults during the first hearing was intriguing. He was not highly
      educated but was certainly no moron. When invited by the court to
      challenge C1’s testimony and to suggest to her that perhaps she was lying
      about all or some of the allegations in the charges, he chose not to do so
      or to ask her any questions regarding the crucial matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Accordingly, the
     Judge agreed with the Prosecution that the Appellant’s subsequent evidence,
     which emerged after he was represented by counsel, about all the possible
     reasons why C1 could be fabricating evidence against him “invited
     scepticism” (see the GD at [65]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It should be noted
     that the Judge did not make any reference to, or findings on, the veracity
     of the Appellant’s testimony or the witnesses that were called by the
     defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Corroborative evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Judge also found
     that there were two pieces of corroborative evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The first was C2’s
     testimony that C1 had confided in C2 about the sexual assaults by the
     Appellant. At [67] of the GD, the
     Judge noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Corroborative evidence may be found in C2’s
       testimony.</em> C1 had confided in C2 about the sexual assaults by
      the Appellant and that caused C2 to have such poor regard for their father
      that he was downgraded to being an uncle in her eyes. No reason has been
      proffered by the Appellant why C2 would also turn against him unjustly.
      She certainly did not appear to have been manipulated by anyone in her
      evidence despite her age. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The second was the
     medical evidence. At [68] of the
     GD, the Judge noted as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Corroborative evidence may also be found in the medical evidence.
      What C1 told the doctors was by and large consistent with her evidence in
      court. Naturally, while the hymenal tears indicated previous sexual
      penetration of the vagina, they did not point to the Appellant being the
      perpetrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     On these grounds, the
     Judge found the Appellant guilty of the five proceeded charges and
     sentenced the Appellant to 29 years’ imprisonment and to a maximum of
     24 strokes of the cane (see above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>–<a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The Appellant in his
     Notice of Appeal dated 2 December 2010 stated that he wished to appeal
     against his sentence and conviction. On 8 February 2011, the Appellant
     confirmed that he would not be engaging counsel to act for his appeal. Soon
     after, on 2 March 2011, the Appellant’s filed his Petition of Appeal, which
     at paragraph 2 and 3 states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>2</em>.    
              <em>Your Petitioner is dissatisfied with the said
        judgment on the ground</em>s <b>the sentence is
        manifestly excessive and unreasonable</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>3</em>.    
              <em>Your Petitioner prays that such Judgment or sentence may be
        reversed annulled or that such order made thereon as Justice may
        require.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics and bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first Court of Appeal hearing (“the first
    CA hearing”) on 29 July 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Two preliminary
     issues took centre stage at the first hearing before this court on 29 July
     2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     First, was the issue
     of whether the Appellant was appealing against only his sentence or his
     conviction as well. This confusion arose from the different grounds of
     appeal stated in the Appellant’s Notice of Appeal and subsequent Petition
     of Appeal (see above at <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a>).
     Clarifications were thus sought from the Appellant who confirmed at the
     hearing that he wished to appeal against his sentence <em>and</em> conviction. The Prosecution did not object. Accordingly,
     the appeal proceeded on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Secondly, there were
     a number of issues which arose from a perusal of the <em>Official Transcript</em> and exhibits in the proceedings in the
     court below which we felt the Prosecution ought to address this court on.
     Accordingly, we ordered that the appeal be adjourned for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Pro bono</em> counsel to be appointed to assist the
      Appellant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Prosecution to reply to this court’s request for
      further information (“the CA’s first round of requests”) on:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_89-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       
              <em>The mother’s, Lathiff’s and C1’s phone
        records</em> in order to verify their testimony on when the couple
       first met and the sequence of events on 29 April 2009 (“the phone
       records”);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_89-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       
              <em>The police report that the mother allegedly
        lodged for the loss of her IC</em> in order to verify the sister’s
       testimony that Lathiff and the mother had met on that occasion (“the loss
       of IC police report”);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_89-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       
              <em>The relevant pages of Lathiff and the mother’s
        passports for all travels they undertook in 2009 and 2010</em> to
       determine whether the couple had indeed travelled to Batam together and
       if they had undertaken other travels together prior to 29 April 2009
       (“the passport pages”);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_89-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       
              <em>C1’s school report</em> to determine the
       extent of C1’s “disciplinary problems” that caused the mother to decline
       Dr Lim’s request for the said report (“C1’s school report”);
      and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_89-p2_b-p3_v"></a>(v)       
              <em>C1’s full HSA statement</em> to ascertain
       the context of the answers which C1 had later disavowed at trial and
       whether the statement contained further relevant information (“C1’s HSA
       statement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We also ordered that a pre-trial conference (“PTC”) be held in a
     month’s time, for the purpose of allowing the court to receive updates on
     the CA’s first round of requests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events between the first and second CA
    hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first PTC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     On 23 August 2011,
     the Prosecution furnished the following information to this court:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_a"></a>(a)     The ICA travel
      records of Lathiff, the mother and her brother;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_b"></a>(b)     C1’s school report;
      and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_c"></a>(c)     C1’s full statement in relation to the HSA investigation (“C1’s HSA
      statement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Prosecution also
     informed this court that the mother had not lodged a police report for the
     loss of her IC and it would need more time for the service providers to
     furnish the phone records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The ICA travel
     records revealed that Lathiff and the mother had made six overseas trips
     together in 2010. On one of these occasions, they were also accompanied by
     the mother’s brother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     However, the
     production of the ICA records was not in strict compliance with our request
     for all the relevant pages in Lathiff and the mother’s passports for all
     travels they undertook in 2009 and 2010 (see above at [89(b)(iii)]). This
     was not an insignificant difference since the ICA travel records only
     highlighted the fact that the couple had gone on joint overseas trips
     without stating the precise destinations where they had travelled
     to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     C1’s school report
     dated 17 August 2011 raised serious concerns about the credibility of her
     trial testimony. The school report was authored by the school’s counsellor
     and discipline co-ordinator (“the school counsellor”). In the report, the
     school counsellor noted that C1 was always “a very quiet and well-behaved
     girl” who “adhered to school rules and did the her [<em>sic</em>] school work.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> However, the school counsellor went on to
     state that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was when a group of Malay boys from the Technical stream of the
      same level was heard boosting [sic] of <b>their
       </b><b><em>sexual endeavors with her
       </em></b><b>[</b><b><em>ie</em></b><b>, C1]</b> that a few issues came
      to light.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon asking [C1] <em>she admitted that she was at the
       park next to may flower primary and did</em><b><em> a
       few adult acts – willingly</em></b><b>.</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The mother was informed and was asked to do the needful. On the
      school side she was counselled and daily monitoring was rendered.
      Arrangements were even made by the DM to give her different recess time,
      so as not to come in contact with the boys or his friends.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Accordingly, the
     school report raised even more questions. Firstly, it did not state exactly
     when these “sexual endeavours” took place, although one can only infer that
     they must have happened sometime between January 2005 and October 2009,
     when C1 was in secondary school.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Additionally, the
     school report did not detail the precise nature of the “adult acts” or
     “sexual endeavours” that C1 had engaged in. This is significant in light
     C1’s evidence that she never had voluntary sexual intercourse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The final item that
     was disclosed by Prosecution at the first PTC was C1’s HSA statement. In
     addition to the fragments of the HSA statement that could be read off the
      <em>Official Transcript</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>), the full statement also revealed that the
     mother had told C1 sometime in April 2010 that if the mother was ever
     caught for stealing cough syrup, <em>Baba</em>
     (Lathiff) would not admit to being the mastermind. The mother was also
     afraid to stop stealing because she was afraid that <em>Baba</em> would scold her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The CA’s second round of requests from the
    Prosecution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In light of these new
     facts emerging, the Prosecution was directed by this court (on 25 August
     2011) to provide details with regard to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_a"></a>(a)     The travel
      destinations of Lathiff, the mother and her brother for the six
      overlapping travel dates; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_b"></a>(b)     The precise nature of the “sexual
      endeavours” and “adult acts” disclosed in the school
    report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The Prosecution were
     also invited to produce:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_a"></a>(a)     All the
      statements made by C1, the mother and Lathiff to the police;
     and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_b"></a>(b)     All the statements made by the Appellant to the
     police.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Prosecution’s reply</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    By a letter dated
     31 August 2011, the Prosecution updated this court, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_a"></a>(a)     It would
      obtain the relevant travel records;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_b"></a>(b)     The information as to the “adults
      acts” “is not available from those who prepared the
     report”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_c"></a>(c)     C1, the mother and Lathiff’s statements recorded by the
      police and HSA in relation to the theft of cough syrup investigation would
      be disclosed to Appellant’s counsel under the rules for disclosure set out
      in <em>Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public
       Prosecutor</em> [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<em>Muhammad bin
       Kadar</em>”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_d"></a>(d)     The statements made by C1, the mother
      and Lathiff to the police in relation to the rape investigation could not
      be disclosed without a prior request from Appellant’s counsel under
      section 122(2) of the CPC (Cap 68). Furthermore, the Prosecution were not
      obliged to disclose these statements according to the <em>Muhammad bin Kadar</em> rules of disclosure;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_e"></a>(e)     Barring any
      objections from the Appellant, the Appellant’s police statements would be
      made available to this court; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_100-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Prosecution’s position was that
      if this court considered the conviction unsafe <em>purely
       on the basis that the new information was not adequately explored at the
       trial below</em>, then the proper course would be to set aside the
      conviction and remit the matter to the Judge for further evidence to be
      led.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In response to the
     Prosecution’s s 122(2) CPC (Cap 68) objection (see above, at [100(d)]), the
     Appellant, on 17 January 2012, made a formal request to the Prosecution for
     all the police statements of C1, the mother and Lathiff recorded in
     relation to the rape investigation to be produced to this
    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second and third PTC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Subsequently, two
     more PTCs were held. The second PTC on 21 September 2011 was an uneventful
     affair with the Prosecution updating the court that the phone and travel
     records were not available yet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    At the third PTC on
     28 October 2011, the Prosecution updated the court that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_a"></a>(a)     The phone
      records received thus far from the service providers was of no use as it
      related to pre-paid SIM cards. As such, more time was required to uncover
      the phone records for the remaining phone lines; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_b"></a>(b)     The mother’s
      passport revealed that five of the six trips with Lathiff were to Malaysia
      while one trip on 12 July 2010 was to Batam. Lathiff’s passport was
      reported lost in September 2010 and was unavailable for verification. The
      couple’s last overlapping trip on 12 October 2010 was captured in his
      replacement passport. This was to Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The Appellant’s
     counsel updated the court that they:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a"></a>(a)     Intended to
      interview the school counsellor in the presence of the
     police;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b"></a>(b)     Wished to apply to refer to the statements made by C1,
      the mother and Lathiff to the police in relation to the rape charges under
      s 122(2) CPC (Cap 68);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_c"></a>(c)     Had been instructed that the
      Appellant had no objections to having his police statements produced to
      this court; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_d"></a>(d)     Would be requesting from the Prosecution: (i) the
      mother’s CPF/employment records; (ii) the status of proceedings in
      relation to the theft of cough syrup investigation; and (iii) the police
      report relating to C1’s running away from home in 2006. A formal request
      to this effect was made by letter to the Prosecution on 4 November
      2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The fourth PTC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    At the fourth PTC
     on 16 January 2012, the Prosecution updated the court that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_a"></a>(a)     The only
      available phone records for the mother and Lathiff were from 1 September
      2009 to 31 December 2010. All phone records prior to 1 September 2009 had
      been purged from the service provider’s records;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_b"></a>(b)     All the five trips
      to Malaysia made by the mother and Lathiff were through the Woodlands
      Checkpoint; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_c"></a>(c)     The school counsellor was able to recall the details of
      the “adult acts” and “sexual endeavours” even though the school records
      had been purged. This would be set out in a conditioned statement to be
      exhibited to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Meanwhile, the
     Appellant’s counsel updated the court that they <em>would
      not</em> be pursuing their requests which were set out in their
     letter to the Prosecution dated 4 November 2011 (see above at
     [104(d)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of the status of the CA’s requests
    before the second CA hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    To summarise, at
     the commencement of the second CA hearing on 8 February 2012, the status of
     all the requests to the Prosecution was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>The phone records</em> of the mother and Lathiff prior to
      1 September 2009 had been purged. However, more time was required to
      provide the phone records for the mother’s last mobile phone number and
      her mother’s home at Yishun;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>The loss of IC
       report</em>, according to the Prosecution, does not
     exist;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>The mother’s passport
       pages</em> reveal that five of the six trips she took with Lathiff
      were to Malaysia (<em>via</em> the Woodlands
      checkpoint) while one trip on 12 July 2010 was to
     Batam;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_d"></a>(d)     
            <em>Lathiff’s passport</em> was
      reported lost in September 2010 and was unavailable for verification.
      However, the couple’s last joint trip on 12 October 2010 is captured in
      his replacement passport. This was to Malaysia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_e"></a>(e)     
            <em>C1’s school report</em> and the school counsellor’s conditioned
      statement dated 19 January 2012 were submitted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_f"></a>(f)     
            <em>C1’s full HSA statement</em> in relation to the HSA investigation
      was submitted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_g"></a>(g)     
            <em>The mother, Lathiff and C1’s police
       statements in relation to the theft of cough syrup
       investigation</em> were submitted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_h"></a>(h)     
            <em>The
       mother, Lathiff and C1’s police statements in relation to the rape
       investigation</em> would be submitted pending the Appellant’s
      formal request under s 122(2) CPC (Cap 68); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_i"></a>(i)     The Appellant’s
      police statements were submitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties’ submissions at the second hearing
    before the Court of Appeal (“the second CA hearing”) on 8 Feb 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    At the second CA
     hearing, the Appellant’s counsel submitted that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_a"></a>(a)     Even without
      taking into account the fundamental problems caused by the additional new
      materials, the conviction in this case is totally unwarranted. Given the
      suspect credibility of C1, the material inconsistencies in her evidence
      and various aspects of her evidence which were simply inherently
      incredible, the Prosecution’s case fell woefully short of proof beyond a
      reasonable doubt. Quite apart from that, independent corroborative
      evidence was totally absent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_b"></a>(b)     The new material, should this court
      be inclined to consider it, compounds the Prosecution’s difficulties even
      further;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_c"></a>(c)     Accordingly, the conviction is plainly unsafe and ought
      to be quashed, without the need to remit this matter back to trial to be
      reconsidered in light of the fresh evidence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the
      alternative, a retrial should be ordered before a new
    judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In response, the
     Prosecution argued that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_109-p2_a"></a>(a)     Based on the
      new material there is no basis to conclude that the finding of guilt has
      been arrived at against the weight of the evidence or is plainly wrong;
      and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_109-p2_b"></a>(b)     However, if this court considers that the conviction is unsafe on
      the basis that the matters which the court seeks to verify were not
      adequately explored in the trial below, then the proper course is for this
      court to remit the matter to the Judge for further evidence to be
      led.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The questions to be
     resolved in the appeal are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was C1’s
      testimony “unusually convincing”?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_b"></a>(b)     Was there any corroborative evidence,
      which would make up for any deficiencies in C1’s
     testimony?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_c"></a>(c)     Did the Prosecution at the trial below prove beyond a
      reasonable doubt that the complaint was not the result of collusion
      between the mother, C1 and Lathiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_d"></a>(d)     If the conviction is unsafe, should a
      retrial before a new judge, remittance on an issue before the Judge or an
      acquittal be ordered?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Was C1’s testimony “unusually
    convincing”?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It is
     well-established that in a case where no other evidence is available, a
     complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt (see
     s 136 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”)) – but only when it
     is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise
     from the lack of corroboration (see generally the decision of this court in
      <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed
      Mallik</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [37]–[44] (“<em>Liton</em>”) and the Singapore High Court decision of
      <em>XP v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686
     at [27]–[36] (“<em>XP</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The need for
     “fine-tooth comb” scrutiny in so far as allegations of sexual abuse are
     concerned is particularly acute, “given both the ease with which
     allegations of sexual assault may be fabricated and the concomitant
     difficulty of rebutting such allegations” (see the Singapore High Court
     decision of <em>Chng Yew Chin v Public
      Prosecution</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 124 at [33], cited with approval in <em>Liton</em> at [37]–[38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In <em>XP</em>, Rajah JA observed (at [31]) that the requirement that the alleged victim’s evidence
     ought to be “unusually convincing”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>... </em>
<em>does nothing,
       however, to change the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its
       case beyond a reasonable doubt</em>, but it does suggest how the
      evidential Gordian knot may be untied if proof is to be found solely from
      the complainant’s testimony against the Appellant. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Apart from stating
     that its role is that of a cognitive aid, Rajah JA further elaborated on
     what “unusually convincing” entails (see <em>XP</em>
     at [29]–[35]). Rajah JA’s pronouncements can be
     distilled into the following propositions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_a"></a>(a)     First,
      subsequent repeated complaints by the complainant cannot, in and of
      themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the
      requirement for “unusually convincing” testimony. As Yong Pung How CJ
      noted in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Khoo
       Kwoon Hain v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591 (“<em>Khoo Kwoon Hain</em>”) at [51]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If the complainant’s evidence is not “unusually convincing”, I
       cannot see how the fact that she repeated it several times can add much
       to its weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the “unusually convincing” reminder should not be
      confined to categories of witnesses who are supposedly accomplices, young
      children or sexual offence complainants;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, a conviction will
      only be set aside where a reasonable doubt exists and not simply because
      the judge did not remind himself of the “unusually convincing”
      standard;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, an “unusually convincing” testimony does not
      overcome even materially and/or inherently contradictory evidence to prove
      guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The phrase “unusually convincing” is not
      a term of art; it does not automatically entail a guilty verdict and
      surely cannot dispense with the need to consider the other evidence and
      the factual circumstances peculiar to each case. Nor does it dispense with
      having to assess the complainant’s testimony against that of the accused,
      where the case turns on one person’s word against the other’s;
     and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifthly, even where there is corroboration, there may still not be
      enough evidence to convict.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Moving from the
     level of scrutiny to the elements of what an unusually convincing testimony
     consists of, it is clear that a witness’s testimony may only be found to be
     “unusually <em>convincing</em>” by weighing the
      <em>demeanour</em> of the witness alongside both the
      <em>internal and external consistencies</em> found in
     the witness’ testimony. Given the inherent epistemic constraints of an
     appellate court as a finder of fact, this inquiry will <em>necessarily</em> be focussed on the internal and external
     consistency of the witness’s testimony. However, this is <em>not</em> to say that a witness’s credibility is <em>necessarily</em> determined <em>solely</em> in
     terms of his or her demeanour. As Rajah JA observed in <em>XP</em> (at [71]–[72]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I freely and readily acknowledge that a trial judge is usually much
      better placed than an appellate judge to assess a witness’s credibility,
      having observed the witness testifying and being cross-examined on the
      stand. <b><em>However, demeanour is not invariably
       determinative; contrary evidence by other witnesses must be given due
       weight, and if the witness fails to recall or satisfactorily explain
       material facts and assertions, his credible demeanour cannot overcome
       such deficiencies.</em></b> As I explained in <em>PP v
       Wang Ziyi Able</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 61 at [92]–[96], an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge
      to draw necessary inferences of fact not supported by the primary or
      objective evidence on record from the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>While an appellate court should be more restrained
       when dealing with the trial judge’s assessment of a witness’s
       credibility, there is a difference between an assessment of a witness’s
       credibility based on his demeanour, and one based on inferences drawn
       from the internal consistency in the content of the witness’s testimony
       or the external consistency between the content of the witness’s evidence
       and the extrinsic evidence. In the latter two situations, the trial
       judge’s advantage in having studied the witness is not critical because
       the appellate court has access to the same material and is accordingly in
       an equal position to assess the veracity of the witness’s
       evidence</em> (see <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v
       PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<em>Jagatheesan</em>”) at [40], citing <em>PP v Choo Thiam
       Hock</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 702 at [11]).</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In light of our
     subsequent finding that the Judge erred in finding the medical evidence and
     C2’s testimony to be corroborative (see Issue 2 below, at <a href="#p1_177">[177]</a>–<a href="#p1_208">[208]</a>), the need for C1’s testimony to be “unusually
     convincing” takes on greater significance. However, as will be demonstrated
     below, the <em>Official Transcript</em> reveals a
     number of significant discrepancies in C1’s testimony which demonstrates
     that it is not “unusually convincing.” Moreover, this assessment is
      <em>confirmed</em> by the new material which has been
     disclosed by the Prosecution at the request of this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">C1’s evidence at the trial below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">C1’s pre-trial testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    C1’s First
     Information Report (“FIR”) was lodged at Ang Mo Kio South NPC at 4.48pm on
     29 April 2009. The report was signed by C1 and reads (in its entirety), as
      follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sometime in year 2006, I was raped by my father one [name of
      Appellant and his NRIC No] at [the flat].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Suffice it to note,
     that apart from its brevity, the offence alleged in the FIR took place in
      <em>2006</em> whereas the proceeded charges took
     place in <em>1999</em> (one charge), <em>2003</em> (two charges), <em>2004</em>
     (one charge) and <em>2009</em> (one charge),
     respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    C1 was also
     interviewed by Dr Lim and Dr Pang on her mental state and sexual history,
     respectively. However, as will be demonstrated below (at <a href="#p1_188">[188]</a>–<a href="#p1_209">[209]</a>), both Dr Lim and Dr Pang’s reports, contrary to the
     Judge’s view (see above at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>), are
     not corroborative and are of questionable probative value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">C1’s testimony at the trial</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Recollection of the first charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In relation to the
     first charge, C1’s evidence-in-chief<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> was
     that the Appellant made her hold his penis and suck it and <em>put his finger on her vagina</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> In cross-examination,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> C1 said that the Appellant made her hold
     his penis and suck it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> and
      <em>penetrated her vagina with his
      finger.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> It appears that the Judge preferred her
     earlier testimony without, with respect, noting this consequential
     inconsistency (see the GD at [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Recollection of the second charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In relation to the
     second charge, C1’s evidence-in-chief was that the Appellant inserted his
     finger into her vagina, made C1 suck his penis and inserted his penis into
     her vagina.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> This account was repeated by C1
     when she was cross-examined by defence counsel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    However, Dr Pang’s
     report mentioned that she was told by C1 that the first alleged rape also
     involved “digito-vaginal, oral-penile, <em>oral-vaginal</em> and penile-vaginal penetration” [emphasis
      added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> In her evidence-in-chief,
     Dr Pang confirmed that she had expressly asked C1: “[d]id he put his mouth
     to your vagina?” and that C1 had answered the question in the
      affirmative.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> C1 did not mention at any time during
     her testimony in the court below that the Appellant had put his mouth on
     her vagina during this incident. This takes on added significance,
     considering that C1 purported to give a detailed step-by-step account of
     the first alleged rape in 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Recollection of the fifth charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Regarding C1’s
     recollection of the fifth and most contemporaneous charge which took place
     on 29 April 2009, the Judge found (see the GD at [64]), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Her account about the events of 29 April 2009 was <em>particularly clear and cogent</em>, probably due to the fact that
      it was the most recent incident involving the Appellant and she was more
      mature by then. It was also the trigger event that led to the police
      report. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    However, despite
     its contemporaneous nature, in our view, C1’s testimony suffers from a
     number of significant inconsistencies which were not, with respect,
     addressed by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    First, C1
      testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> that the Appellant had held her
     right wrist with his left hand and pulled her towards him. The Appellant
     managed to unbutton the first button below the collar button of her blouse.
     She told the Appellant: “<em>[C1] tak nak buat
      itu.</em>” (translated from Malay: “[C1], does not want to do it.”).
     The Appellant replied: “<em>Macam tak biasa itu.</em>”
     (translated from Malay: “As if you haven’t done it before.”). C1 then said:
      “<em>[C1] nak call mummy ini.</em>” (translated: “I’m
     going to call mummy.”), took out her mobile phone and dialled her mother’s
     number. The Appellant tried to close C1’s flip phone but by that time her
     mother had picked up. C1 asked her mother where she was. The mother replied
     that she was on the bus. C1 told mother that she was leaving the flat.
     Then, C1 quickly took her school bag and shoes and walked out of the
     flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    When, however, C1
     was recalled, she testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> that
     the Appellant had held her right hand with his left hand and she stood up.
     She clarified that while the Appellant was holding her right hand and
     unbuttoning her blouse, she managed to take out her mobile phone from right
     skirt pocket with her right hand. When C1 was making the call with her
     mobile phone, the Appellant tried to close the phone’s flap as that would
     end the call. C1 further added that that while she was struggling, the
     Appellant moved behind her and held her left hand. When questioned by
     defence counsel whether this was mentioned in C1’s evidence-in-chief, she
     replied that she did not state so. Nonetheless, C1 went on to state that
     after the Appellant had moved behind her, he held her left hand and then
     she took out her mobile phone from her right skirt pocket. When further
     questioned, she changed her earlier position and said that the Appellant
     had not moved behind her but she had shifted. She later maintained that the
     Appellant did not release her hand throughout. C1 also stated that the
     Appellant <em>did not</em> manage to unbutton any
     button on her blouse. C1 clarified that her earlier equivocation on the
     question was because she was tired and confused. This led the Judge to
     amend the fifth charge of his own accord to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... wit, by <del>undoing
       </del><em>attempting to</em> undo one button.
      [strikethrough in original]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    On either of C1’s
     accounts, it seems improbable that she was able to overpower the
     Appellant’s grip on her right hand or wrist, reach into her right skirt
     pocket, fish out her mobile phone and call her mother – all with the same
     right hand, whilst in the midst of a struggle. Furthermore, it is also
     questionable how the Appellant was able to unbutton C1’s blouse, hold her
     hand throughout and try to stop her from using her mobile phone – all at
     the same time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Secondly, when C1
     confided in her mother, the latter testified that she had asked C1 whether
     it was “<em>sedap</em>” (translated: “nice or not”).
     The mother explained that she asked this question to find out if her
     daughter was a willing party. When recalled, C1 denied that the mother had
     said this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Even taking into
     account the fact that a victim’s testimony of such a traumatic event would
     inevitably be imperfect, these are troubling inconsistencies which were
     apparently not scrutinised below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">The frequency of the alleged rapes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Apart from the
      <em>internal </em><em>inconsistencies</em> within C1’s trial testimony with regard to the
     alleged rapes, the new material brought to focus a significant <em>external inconsistency</em> in C1’s account of the
     frequency of the alleged rapes. To be clear, this inconsistency was, as we
     shall see, already present in the <em>Official
      Transcript</em> and exhibits in the trial below. In this regard, the
     relevant new material, <em>viz</em>, C1’s statements
     recorded by the police, <em>only</em> serves to
      <em>confirm</em> our conclusion that C1’s testimony
     was <em>not</em> “unusually convincing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Beginning
     chronologically, in the FIR on 29 April 2009 at 4.48pm, C1 stated that she
     had <em>been rape</em>d by the Appellant <em>“[s]ometime in year 2006”.</em> The new material submitted
     by the Prosecution contains Lathiff’s investigation diary entry of his
     interview with C1 on 29 April 2009 at 5.45pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> In this diary entry,
     C1 was recorded as stating that <em>from sometime in 2003 to
      2005, she was raped by her father “on 4 to 5 occasions in a
      month”.</em> C1 also claimed that <em>from “July 2006
      to Dec[ember] 2006, her father had sex with her on two or three
      occasions”.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The next interview
     was conducted by SI Chandra a few hours later at 9.35pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> This time, C1’s breakdown of the
     alleged rapes was as follows: <em>four to five times in
      2003</em>; <em>three times in 2004; three times in
      2005; and two times in 2006</em>, respectively. Taking even the most
     conservative estimate, these two accounts, given within the span of a few
     hours, represent a difference of close to 100 rapes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In her statement
     recorded on 30 April 2009 at 3.15pm by SI Chandra, C1 stated that she was
     raped <em>four times in 2003; three to four times in 2004;
      and twice in 2006</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Two and a half months later, C1 recorded
     another statement on 13 July 2009 at 4.45 pm where she confirmed that there
     were <em>no rapes in 2005 and that she was raped twice in
      July and November 2006 respectively.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    A year later, C1’s
     statement of 15 July 2010 stated that she was <em>raped
      sometime in 2004 during the day time</em> and <em>sometime in February 2006.</em> As is clear from these police
     statements, there is hardly a single instance where C1 maintained a
     consistent account of the frequency of the alleged rapes over two or more
     consecutive statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> There is also a clear trend of C1’s
     allegations of the frequency of the rapes decreasing with each successive
     statement she gave to the police.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Further, the police
     Statement of Facts (“SOF”), which was prepared by SI Chandra and furnished
     to Dr Lim, stated that C1 was raped <em>“4 to 5 occasions in
      a month” from 2003 to 2005</em> and <em>two to three
      times between July and December 2006.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    This substantially
     larger figure was corroborated by both medical experts. Dr Lim’s report
     dated 10 July 2009 stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">C1 said that her father had vaginal sex with her regularly during the
      period when she was in Primary 4 [2003] till Secondary One [2006],
       <em>averaging 4 to 5 times a month.</em> [emphasis
      added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was confirmed in Dr Lim’s trial testimony.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> The same figure was repeated by C1 to
     Dr Pang as recorded in Dr Pang’s report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> and
     hand-written notes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Further, Dr Pang’s trial testimony was
     that her medical report was based on C1’s answers to the specific questions
     which she had posed to C1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    This is in stark
     contrast to the evidence at the trial itself where C1 alleged that there
     were <em>two isolated rape incidents in 2003, two rape
      incidents in 2004 and two rape incidents in 2006.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    At the second CA
     hearing, these somewhat glaring inconsistencies were forcefully raised by
     counsel for the Appellant, Mr Harpreet Singh SC (“Mr Singh”), who submitted
     that they cannot be easily explained on the basis that C1’s memory of the
     rapes had faded over time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Counsel for the
     Prosecution, Ms Lee Lit Cheng (“Ms Lee”), submitted that there was an
     innocent explanation for the variations in frequency. Apart from Lathiff’s
     investigation diary entry on 29 April 2009, all of the remaining statements
     given by C1 to the police did not indicate that the rapes took place
     between four to five times a month. Therefore, the SOF must have mistakenly
     reflected this substantially larger figure. This was clearly an oversight
     by SI Chandra because this substantially larger figure was never recorded
     by SI Chandra in any of the statements he took from C1. The SOF was then
     furnished to Dr Lim, which would explain why his report repeated the
     substantially larger figure. This led to the error being innocently
     perpetuated in Dr Lim and Dr Pang’s testimony at the trial itself. This
     will be referred to as the “innocent explanation thesis”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    However, there is
     no indication from Dr Lim’s testimony at the trial itself that he had
     blindly copied the substantially larger figure from the SOF. In fact,
     Dr Lim’s testimony clearly states otherwise:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now, Dr Lim, now, can you, based on your
       recollection from your notes, tell us how [C1] describe the background of
       this --- this sexual intercourse to you? How were---how---how did those
       information basically come out during the interview?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Right. So---usually during the interview,
       the---the first bit, erm, is when I build some rapport with er. So I---I
       obtained some information about background, family history before I went
       on to ask her about what---whether she was aware about the charge. So she
       told me that the charge is child abuse. <em>When I asked
        her, erm, what that meant, she said in her own words, “My biological
        father had sex with me when I was in primary 4.” Then she went on to say
        that this happened for about 4 to 5 times a month since primary 4 and
        the last time it happened was in secondary 1</em>. After that,
       erm, basically, I probed with some questions before she went on to
       describe that these events happened at home and because, erm, <em>there were </em><em>several
        occasions</em>, she said that usually, it would happen after
       midnight and it would take place in the halls and that her father will
       carry her out to the hall.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Pertinently, the
     Prosecution at the trial were content to accept Dr Lim’s account that C1
     had specifically told him that the “rapes” had “happened for about 4 to
     5 times a month since primary 4 and the last time it happened was in
      secondary 1.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Further, we think
     it is important to point out that the innocent explanation thesis is
     contradicted by Dr Pang’s report and hand-written notes<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> which
     similarly recorded the substantially larger figure of four to five rapes a
     month from 2003 to 2006. We pause to note that this would conservatively
     add up to 192 alleged rape incidents in total (see above at <a href="#p1_132">[132]</a>). Indeed, as the Prosecution conceded at
     the second CA hearing, it appears that the SOF was not given to Dr Pang. In
     any event, Dr Pang testified that this information was unmistakably given
     by C1 in the course of their interview:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Pang also confirmed this figure was given to her by C1 when she was
     re-called by the Appellant during the second tranche of the trial in the
     court below.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Moreover, the CID
     Report, which was a separate document from the SOF, given to Dr Pang before
     her interview with C1, did not mention the substantially larger figure of
     alleged rapes of four to five times a month <em>since
      2003</em>. On the contrary, the CID Report plainly states that the
     assaults only began in 2006:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On April 2009, the abovementioned lodged <em>a police
       report stating that since 2006 July</em>, she was sexually
      assaulted by her biological father. She claimed that the last coitus took
      place sometime in end 2006. Kindly examine for her <em>virgo intact</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    We pause to
     observe, parenthetically, that this inconsistency between Dr Pang’s report
     and the CID Report was raised by the defence counsel during Dr Pang’s
     cross-examination and could therefore have been explored in the proceedings
      below.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Indeed, the CID Report,
     which was exhibited in the Preliminary Inquiry (“PI”) Bundle, was not
     admitted into evidence although the Prosecution explicitly sought the
     Judge’s leave to do so at the end of Dr Pang’s re-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> The CID Report was again referred to by
     Dr Pang when she was later recalled by the Appellant after he had engaged
     counsel. The CID Report, was however not admitted into
      evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> Thus, the CID Report only surfaced
     in its entirety when it was exhibited by the Appellant at the second CA
     hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Returning to the
     inconsistencies in relation to the frequency of the alleged rapes committed
     by the Appellant on C1, the Prosecution’s innocent explanation thesis would
     have us unquestioningly accept that three different witnesses, <em>ie</em>, Dr Lim, Dr Pang and SI Chandra, had made the same
     innocent mistake when recording C1’s testimony independently of each other.
     This suggestion is, with respect, even more fanciful when one takes into
     account the fact that Dr Lim and Dr Pang have no vested interest in the
     matter and, more significantly, the SOF was never provided to
     Dr Pang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    It should also be
     emphasised that these inconsistencies in the frequency of the alleged rapes
     were already present in the <em>Official
      Transcript</em> and exhibits in the trial below (see above at
      <a href="#p1_136">[136]</a>–<a href="#p1_137">[137]</a>). In fact, the new material, particularly the SOF and
     Lathiff’s investigation diary entry on 29 April 2009, only served to
      <em>confirm</em> our conclusion on the
    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was C1’s testimony “unusually
    convincing”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    This significant
      <em>external</em> inconsistency in the frequency of
     the alleged rapes found in C1’s trial testimony and her earlier statements
     to the police cogently suggest that C1’s evidence was quite obviously
     questionable and therefore not “unusually convincing”. It should be
     reiterated that this new material, <em>viz</em>, C1’s
     statements to the police, only serves to confirm the same <em>external</em> inconsistency between C1’s trial testimony
     and the doctors’ reports, which were exhibited and subjected to
     cross-examination in the trial below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In this respect, it
     is puzzling that the Prosecution had initially resisted disclosing to the
     Appellant, C1’s statements to the police in relation to the rape
     investigation (see above at <a href="#p1_100">[100]</a>).
     This is clear from the Prosecution’s letter to the Court dated 31 August
     2011 where it was stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These statements [C1, Lathiff and the mother’s statements made
      pursuant to the rape investigation] are not liable to disclosure under the
      criteria set out in <em>Muhammad bin Kadar &amp; Ismil bin
       Kadar v PP</em> [2011] SGCA 32 (“<em>Muhammad bin
       Kadar</em>”);</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The relevant
     passage in <em>Muhammad bin Kadar</em> (at <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>–<a href="#p1_114">[114]</a>) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">113    … It
       suffices for us to say that we agree with the Prosecution that the duty
       of disclosure certainly does not cover all unused material or even all
       evidence inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case. However, the
       Prosecution must disclose to the Defence material which takes the form
       of:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    any unused material that is likely to be
        admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and
        relevant to the guilt or innocence of the Appellant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    any unused material that is likely to be
        inadmissible, but would provide a real (not fanciful) chance of pursuing
        a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible
        and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the
        guilt or innocence of the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>This will not include material which is neutral
       or adverse to the Appellant – it only includes material that tends to

      disclosure this material should initially be disclosed no later than seven
      days before the date fixed for the committal hearing for High Court trials
      or two weeks from the CCDC for Subordinate Court trials (corresponding to
      the timelines in ss 176(3)(b) and 161(2) of the CPC 2010 respectively).
      Where under s 159 of the CPC 2010 the statutory criminal case disclosure
      procedures do not apply, <b><em>the common law disclosure
       described here should take place at the latest before the trial

      submissions) is a continuing one and <b><em>only ends when
       the case has been completely disposed of, including any appeal.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">114    When we use the phrase “material ... that

     Prosecution disclosed to the Appellant C1’s police statements in relation
     to the rape investigation <em>during the second CA
      hearing</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    C1’s police
     statements were by all accounts <em>“prima facie credible
      and relevant”</em> to the Appellant’s guilt or innocence. Indeed,
     this must have been tacitly accepted by the Prosecution as evidenced by its
     position that the new evidence should be remitted before the Judge, a point
     which we will return to later (see Issue 4 below, at <a href="#p1_269">[269]</a>–<a href="#p1_309">[309]</a>). After all, if the Prosecution was indeed of the view
     that C1’s police statements were completely irrelevant, why seek to remit
     the matter as opposed to an outright conviction, even if this was presented
     as an argument in the alternative?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Moreover, it is
     clear that all six of C1’s previously undisclosed C1’s police
      statements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> are at least relevant in so far as
     they revealed, <em>inter alia</em>, significant
     discrepancies in the frequency of the alleged rapes. This should have
     engaged the Prosecution’s <em>continuing obligation of
      disclosure</em> that “<em>only ends when the case has
      been completely disposed of, including any appeal</em>” (see
      <em>Muhammad bin Kadar</em> at [113]). Moreover, the <em>Muhammad bin Kadar</em> judgment was released on 5 July 2011.
     Whilst this was admittedly close to the first CA hearing for this case on
     29 July 2011, it was well before the second CA hearing on 8 February
     2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Epilogue: the new material</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    While the above
     findings establish that C1’s testimony was not “unusually convincing” and
     therefore sufficient to acquit the Appellant (in the absence of
     corroborative evidence, as to which see <a href="#p1_173">[173]</a>–<a href="#p1_209">[209]</a> below), we
     pause to note a number of disquieting further <em>external
      inconsistencies</em> between C1’s trial testimony and the new
     material which undermine C1’s credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Alleged physical abuse</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    An even more
     striking revelation that emerged from C1’s previously undisclosed police
     statements was the allegation that she had been beaten and slapped by her
     father when she refused him sex.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    C1’s statement
     recorded on 30 April 2009 at 3.15pm stated that she was “beaten up” by the
     Appellant when she refused him sex on one occasion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>
     In C1’s statement recorded on 15 July 2010 at 5.25pm, she claimed that the
     Appellant had attempted to have sex with C1 during one night in 2004. When
     C1 resisted, the Appellant “slapped” her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> Similarly, C1’s statement recorded on
     19 July 2010 also stated that in 2004 there was one occasion when the
     Appellant beat C1 up when she refused to have sex with him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    However, C1’s
     testimony at trial made no mention of any physical abuse by the Appellant
     towards her. This omission is, in our view, significant given that C1’s
     mind was directed to the issue of family violence when she explained in her
     examination in-chief that she did not want to tell her mother about the
     alleged rapes as she was scared that “my mother would ask my father and I’m
     afraid that my father will beat her up.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span>
     Furthermore, there are no references to any physical abuse towards C1 in
     Dr Pang’s and Dr Lim’s reports although Dr Lim recorded C1’s account of how
     the Appellant was physically violent towards <em>the
      mother</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The frequency of the alleged incidents of
    fellatio</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    C1’s testimony in
     the court below was that there were sporadic incidents of fellatio in 1999
     and 2000. In her evidence-in-chief, C1 stated that apart from the first
     time she was asked to perform fellatio when she was in kindergarten two (in
     1999), which formed the basis of the first charge, there were “<em>other incidents</em>” of fellatio that year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> C1 also alleged that the incidents of
     fellatio continued in primary one (2000) and that no such incidents
     occurred in 2001 and 2002.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> Under
     cross-examination, C1 maintained the position that she was made to perform
     fellatio “<em>a few times</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    However, C1’s
     police statements reveal a <em>different</em> picture.
     C1’s police statement dated 19 July 2010 claimed that the Appellant had
     asked C1 to:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[S]uck his penis about <em>3 times to 4 times a
       month</em>. Sometimes, he will not ask me to do it for a few months
      and then he will start again. I cannot remember exactly how many times I
      was made to suck his penis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It continued until I was in Primary 1 in the year 2000 ... The oral
      sex continued through Primary 1 until I was about to go to Primary 2. My
      father then stopped asking me to suck his penis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Similarly, the SOF
     stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Appellant] requested her to perform oral sex on him about
       <em>twice a week</em> [from the first incident in
      1999]. [C1] claimed that the oral sex activities stopped when she was in
       <em>Pri 2</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    In fact, this is a
     glaring inconsistency, which cannot be dismissed merely on the basis that
     C1’s recollection of events in the distant past is inevitably imperfect. As
     the Appellant’s submissions notes:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As with the case of the frequency of the alleged rape incidents,
      there is such a stark contrast between the 2 versions as to seriously
      undermine [C1’s] credibility and the overall strength of the Prosecution’s
      case. <em>Again, if, as [C1] had informed the Police, she
       had been made to perform fellatio 2 times each week (or 8 times each
       month) over 2 years, one would have expected her evidence at trial and
       the Prosecution’s closing submissions to reflect this. The conspicuous
       absence of any such suggestion at trial is (as in the case of the alleged
       rape incidents) fundamentally detrimental to her credibility and the
       force of her testimony.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The people C1 told about the alleged
    rapes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    When questioned
     during the trial as to whether C1 had disclosed the alleged rapes to any
     person, C1 only mentioned that she had told her younger sister (C2) about
     the rapes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> However, the
     information disclosed in the new material cast a somewhat different light
     on this account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    C1’s statements
     dated: 29 April 2009 at 9.35pm;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> 30 April at
      3.15pm;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> and 19 July
      2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> mention that she had told her ex-boyfriend
     in December 2008 that she had been raped. C1 had dated him for six months
     and they had broken off the relationship sometime in February
      2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> His mobile phone
     number was recorded in C1’s statements dated 29 April 2009 at
      9.35pm<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> and 30 April at 3.15pm<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> but surprisingly no serious follow-up
     action appears to have been taken by the investigators to locate this
     ex-boyfriend. This account is consistent with Dr Pang’s testimony that C1
     had told her ex-boyfriend of the sexual assaults. This was a particularly
     material omission from C1’s trial testimony.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">C1’s previous sexual history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    The Prosecution
     were directed by this court to produce C1’s school report owing to the less
     than convincing reason the mother and C1 gave at trial for denying its
     production to Dr Lim (see above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>
     and [89(b)(iv)]). To recapitulate, the mother claimed that she had not
     wanted C1’s school to know about the alleged rapes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>
     However, C1 admitted in cross-examination that the school report would
     expose her disciplinary problems at school:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    It should also be
     noted that, barely a few questions later, C1 denied having disciplinary
     problems at school and at home prior to April 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> Moreover, the mother had earlier in the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    The school report
     dated 17 August 2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> was
     eventually submitted by the Prosecution on 23 August 2011. The relevant
     paragraphs read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was when a group of Malay boys from the Technical stream of the
      same level was heard boosting [sic] of <em>their sexual
       endeavors with</em> her [C1] that a few issues came to
      light.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Upon asking [C1] she admitted that she was at the
       [nearby] park...and did a few adult acts – willingly.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The mother was informed and was asked to do the needful. On the
      school side she was counselled and daily monitoring was rendered.
      Arrangements were even made by the DM to give her different recess time,
      so as not to come in contact with the boys or his friends.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    In response to the
     second round of requests from this court that sought, <em>inter alia</em>, an elaboration of what these “adult acts”
     consisted of, the Prosecution, in its letter dated 31 August 2011, stated
     that the information relating to C1’s “adults acts” and “sexual endeavours”
      <em>“was not available from those who prepared the
      report”</em> (see above at [100(b)]) However, during the fourth PTC
     held on 16 January 2012, the Prosecution informed the court that the school
     counsellor was able to recall the information even though the school
     records had been purged (see above at [105(c)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The counsellor’s
     conditioned statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> dated 19 January 2012 states that,
     sometime in 2007, C1, who was then in secondary two, was interviewed by the
     counsellor after she had heard two boys boasting about their “sexual
     endeavours” with C1. In her interview with the two boys, they revealed that
     they had spent two nights at a park with C1. One of the boys informed the
     counsellor that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[D]uring the kissing, he forcefully pushed [C1]’s
       head towards his groin and made her perform oral sex on him.
       Subsequently, I gathered from</em> [him] <em>that
       she performed the act of oral sex willingly. I cannot remember if [C1]
       performed oral sex on the other boy.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the second night, the two boys attempted to perform anal sex on
      [C1] but their attempts did not materialise. No oral sex took place on the
      second night apart from kissing. Separately I interviewed [C1] about the
      revelations made by the two boys. All the interviews I conducted with the
      trio were done separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When I interviewed [C1] about why she spent two nights at the
       park<em>, she informed me that she had ran away from home
       due to family problems. I still remember that she started to cry and did
       not want to elaborate about her family problems. It took her a while to
       calm down.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason why we decided to inform their parents instead of making a
      police report was because the incidents took place outside the school
      premises and during a weekend. We left the decision to the parents if they
      wished to initiate a police report. As for [C1]’s mother, she was invited
      to the school and we conveyed the message to her. <em>I
       remembered clearly that she wanted to discuss the matter with her husband
       before deciding whether she would make a police report.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    The Prosecution’s
     position on these two pieces of new material, <em>viz</em>, the school report and school counsellor’s conditioned
     statement, is that whether C1 engaged in any sexual act with the two boys
     was irrelevant to the question whether the Appellant had raped
      her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> This seemingly simple logic is,
     with respect, questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    On the contrary,
     this new material is, in our view, hardly irrelevant to the question as to
     whether the Appellant had raped C1. First, it undermines C1’s overall
     credibility by contradicting her testimony that she was not sexually active
     apart from the alleged rapes. At the trial, C1 had emphatically testified
     that she did not have sexual intercourse with any of her three
      boyfriends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> and
     only shared “just a kiss on the cheek” with one of the boys.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> Dr Pang’s report recorded that C1 had a
     boyfriend when she was in secondary one, but C1 had claimed that they did
     not have any sexual relations. Similarly, Dr Lim’s report recorded that C1
     had “previous non-sexual relationships with 3 boys, the longest of which
     lasted over a year starting from Secondary One.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Secondly, and more
     significantly, the new material raises the very real possibility that C1’s
     hymenal tears could be attributable to conduct unrelated to the Appellant.
     The Judge was unaware of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    We are mindful,
     however, that the fact that C1 might have previously engaged in “adult
     acts” does not in itself compromise her credibility. This is, in our view,
     to improperly engage in the “forbidden chain of reasoning” (see
     Lord Hailsham’s speech in the House of Lords decision of <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Boardman</em> [1975] AC 421 at
     453). Instead, Mr Singh quite correctly relied on these new pieces of
     evidence to suggest that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The attempt by the Complainant and her mother to suppress the school
      report raises serious questions as to her overall credibility and whether
      she is being <em>“forthright”</em> with the Court.
      The Complainant was obviously not being <em>“forthright”</em> when she attempted to suppress this incident.
      [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, it has been foremost in our minds that it is the Appellant’s
     alleged conduct and <em>not</em> C1’s sexual history
     that is on trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    That said, the new
     material remains (as we have pointed out above) relevant in rebutting C1’s
     testimony in the lower court that she was not sexually active. To
     reiterate, C1’s sexual history would indeed be completely irrelevant but
     for the fact that, based on C1’s trial testimony, C1’s hymenal tears could
     not be plausibly attributed to anyone but the Appellant (see above at
      <a href="#p1_169">[169]</a>). The new evidence changes all
     that, and, to that very limited extent, it is highly significant especially
     given that the Judge’s GD (at [30])
     made reference to the fact that, “C1 said that she did not have sex with
     any other person <em>besides [the Appellant]</em>”
     [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Was there any corroborative
    evidence?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    It is settled law
     that where the evidence of a complainant is not “unusually convincing”, an
     accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the
     complainant’s story. This requirement was laid down in Federation of Malaya
     High Court decision of <em>Public Prosecutor v
      Mardai</em> [1950] MLJ 33 where Spencer-Wilkinson J declared (at
     33), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whilst there is no rule of law in this country that in sexual
      offences the evidence of the complainant must be corroborated;
      nevertheless it appears to me, as a matter of common sense, to be unsafe
      to convict in cases of this kind unless either the evidence of the
      complainant is unusually convincing or there is some corroboration of the
      complainant’s story. <em>It would be sufficient, in my
       view, if that corroboration consisted only of a </em><b><em>subsequent complaint by complainant herself
       </em></b><em>provided that the statement
       </em><b><em>implicated the Appellant
       </em></b><em>and was </em><b><em>made
       at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the
       offence.</em></b> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The EA did not, at its inception, provide a definition of
     corroboration and still does not do so. In <em>Liton</em>, this court (at [43]) preferred Spencer-Wilkinson J’s more liberal approach to
     corroboration (“liberal corroboration”) as opposed to the stricter
     traditional common law definition laid down in <em>The King
      v Baskerville</em> [1916] 2 KB 658 at 667 (“<em>Baskerville</em>”) of independent evidence implicating the
     Appellant in a material particular (“<em>Baskerville</em> corroboration”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t is clear that the Baskerville standard... does not apply in
      its strict form in Singapore since Yong CJ, in <em>Tang Kin
       Seng</em> (<a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> supra),
      advocated a liberal approach in determining whether a particular piece of
      evidence can amount to corroboration. This is so, notwithstanding Yong
      CJ’s apparent allusion to the whole or part of the <em>Baskerville</em> standard in <em>B v PP</em>
      [2003] 1 SLR(R) 400 (at [27]);
       <em>Lee Kwang Peng</em> (<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> supra) at [71];
      and <em>Kwan Peng Hong</em> (<a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> supra) at [37]
      as being “essential” in nature. In our view, to adopt a stringent
      definition of what constitutes corroborative evidence goes against the
      liberal approach which Yong CJ himself alluded to as a broad principle of
      law in the other cases. In <em>Kwan Peng Hong</em>
      (at [36]), Yong CJ held that our
      courts “have left behind a technical and inflexible approach to
      corroboration and its definition”, and alluded to similar pronouncements
      in <em>Tang Kin Seng</em> (at [53]–[68]) and <em>Soh Yang Tick</em>
       (<a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> supra at [43]). The principle of law which emerges
      from these cases is that the local approach to locating corroborative
      evidence is <em>liberal</em>, thus ensuring that the
      trial judge has the necessary flexibility to treat relevant evidence as
      corroborative. <b><em>What is important is the substance as
       well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or
       confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to
       corroborate.</em></b> [emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold
      italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Similarly in
      <em>XP</em>, Rajah JA observed (at [31]) that the liberal approach has:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… found favour in our jurisprudence for its inherent pragmatism and
      intuitive good sense. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Nonetheless, he immediately proceeded to reiterate that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It does nothing, however, to change the ultimate
       rule that</em> the Prosecution must prove its case <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em> ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Indeed, it would be
     wholly misconceived to think that so-called “liberal corroboration” does
     not possess its own inherent conceptual constraints. For instance, s 159 of
     the EA states that former statements of witnesses may be proved to
     corroborate later testimony as to the same fact so long as the former
     statements was made <em>“at or about the time when the fact
      took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the
      fact.”</em> Section 159 of the EA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Former statements of
       witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same
       fact</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>159</b>.    In order to
       corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such
       witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation,
       relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place,
       or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be
       proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    In the Singapore
     High Court decision of <em>Lee Kwang Peng v Public
      Prosecutor</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 569 (“<em>Lee Kwang
      Peng</em>”) (at [80]),
     Yong CJ applied s 159 of the EA to the facts in that case and found
     that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the complaints made by the first and second complainants did not
      even fall within the ambit of s 159, <em>because they were
       made so long after the alleged incidents.</em> Even if that
      difficulty could be circumvented, I would still have to conclude, as did
      the High Court in <em>Khoo Kwoon Hain</em> that such
      corroboration, not being independent, could only be of ‘little additional
      evidential value’. See also <em>John Benjamin
       Cadawanaltharayil v PP</em> [1995] 3 SLR 805 and <em>PP v Anuar bin Arshad</em> [1996] 2 SLR 52. [emphasis
      added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Lee Kwang Peng</em>, the complaints by the
     first and second complainants were made one year and six months
     respectively after the alleged incidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    As Yong CJ noted in
     the passage cited in the preceding paragraph, such “corroboration”, not
     being independent, could only be of “little additional evidential value”.
     In other words, whilst the failure to meet the strict standards of
      <em>Baskerville</em> corroboration does not rule out
     the <em>relevance</em> of evidence, this deficiency is
     likely to adversely affect the <em>weight</em> of the
     evidence which the court concerned may accord to it. In the final analysis,
     to reiterate the words of this court in <em>Liton</em>
     (at [43]), “[w]hat is important is
     the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is
     supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to
     corroborate.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The Judge at
      [67]–[68] of his GD found two pieces of evidence that, in his view,
     corroborated C1’s account. The first was C2’s testimony that C1 had
     confided in C2 about the sexual assaults by the Appellant (see the GD at
      [67] and above at <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>). The second was the medical evidence (see
     the GD at [68] and above at
      <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>). These two findings will be
     considered <em>seriatim.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    At this juncture,
     it should be pointed out that the Judge did not explain whether he was
     referring to <em>Baskerville</em> corroboration or
     liberal corroboration. Thus, for the sake of completeness, the analysis
     will proceed on the basis that: (a) the Judge was referring to <em>Baskerville</em> corroboration; and (b) in the alternative,
     if in fact the two pieces of evidence do not constitute <em>Baskerville</em> corroboration, we will then examine the relevance
     and weight that should be assigned to both pieces of
    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">C2’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    It is unclear from
     the GD whether the Judge found C2’s accounts of <em>all
      three episodes</em> corroborative of the C1’s evidence with respect
     to the five charges before him (see above at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>). For instance, the Judge referred to all three episodes
     at [40]–[42] of the GD albeit under the section
     entitled “The prosecution’s case”. Later under the section entitled “The
     decision of the court”, he mentioned at [67] of the GD that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Corroborative evidence may be found in
       C2’s</em> testimony. C1 had confided in C2 about the sexual
      assaults by the Appellant and that caused C2 to have such poor regard for
      their father that he was downgraded to being an uncle in her eyes. No
      reason has been proffered by the Appellant why C2 would also turn against
      him unjustly. She certainly did not appear to have been manipulated by
      anyone in her evidence despite her age. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    This suggests that
     the Judge’s opening sentence, <em>viz</em>, <em>“corroborative evidence may be found in C2’s
      testimony”</em>, was meant to include C2’s testimony on all three
     episodes with the remainder of the paragraph being a non-exhaustive
     elaboration of C2’s testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    As should be
     apparent, C2’s testimony on the third episode does <em>not</em> constitute corroboration in the <em>Baskerville sense</em> since it is merely, on C2’s own account, a
     repetition of what C1 told her. This inevitably diminishes its probative
     value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    In fact, on closer
     scrutiny, <em>none</em> of the three episodes
     recounted by C2’s account is corroborative, in either the <em>Baskerville</em> or the liberal sense, for other more
     fundamental reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    First, all three
     episodes that were recounted by C2 did not form the basis for any of the
     charges proceeded upon in the court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Secondly, C2’s
     accounts of the first and second episodes, which took place in 2006, should
     either have been rendered inadmissible as they do not constitute similar
     fact evidence that is admissible under the EA, or, if admitted, have been
     given little weight. The alleged <em>modus operandi
      o</em>f the Appellant was significantly different from that found in
     the charges proceeded upon in the court below. Similar to the first four
     charges, the Appellant was in the living room, while the three children
     were asleep in their bedroom. However, <em>unlike</em>
     the first four charges, the Appellant had allegedly disrupted his settled
      <em>modus operandi s</em>ince 1999, <em>viz</em>, only waking up C1 and bringing her into the hall,
     leaving C2 and C3 asleep) in favour of a different approach. In relation to
     the first episode, this involved getting C2 and C3 to leave the room and
     locking himself in the room with C1. In relation to the second episode,
     this involved moving “on top” of C1 while she was sleeping in her bedroom
     although C2 and C3 were in the same bedroom at the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    Thirdly, C2’s
     testimony on all three episodes does not disclose incidents of rape and/or
     fellatio which are the offences in the five charges. To recapitulate, in
     the first episode, as C2 was told by the Appellant to leave the bedroom,
     she did not see what happened inside the bedroom. In the second episode,
     she saw the Appellant on top of C1, but nothing more. In the third episode,
     she was told by C1 that the Appellant had touched C1’s vagina and body (see
     above at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Fourthly, C2’s
     recollection of the third episode is also inconsistent with C1’s trial
     testimony. C2’s evidence was that one afternoon in 2008, while C1 and she
     were <em>in the kitchen at their flat</em>; C1 told
     her that on the first episode where C2 was asked to leave the bedroom, the
      <em>Appellant had touched C1’s vagina and her
      body.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> However, C1’s testimony at trial was that
     on this particular occasion, the Appellant had <em>made C1
      perform fellatio on him.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> Further, C1 recounted that she had
     revealed this to C2 when they were at <em>their
      grandmother’s house.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> The latter inconsistency had already been
     pointed out to C2 during cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The medical evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    There were two
     medical reports of C1 which the Prosecution tendered, <em>viz</em>, Dr Pang’s report and Dr Lim’s report (see above at
      <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>–<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    In so far as both
     medical reports were concerned, the Judge held at [68] of the GD that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Corroborative evidence may also be found in the medical evidence.
       <em>What C1 told the doctors was by and large consistent
       with her evidence in court.</em> Naturally, while the hymenal tears
      indicated previous sexual penetration of the vagina, they did not point to
      the Appellant being the perpetrator. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Accordingly, the
     Judge found the following two elements in the medical reports corroborative
     of C1’s account:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_190-p2_a"></a>(a)     Dr Pang’s
      findings on the C1’s hymnenal tears were corroborative of the fact that
      sexual penetration had taken place. It is not corroborative of the fact
      that the Appellant had <em>caused</em> C1’s hymenal
      tears; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_190-p2_b"></a>(b)     C1’s interview with the doctors was corroborated by her
      testimony at trial with regard to the alleged sexual
     assaults.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    These two elements
     of the medical evidence will be examined <em>seriatim.</em> Before doing so, a number of preliminary points may
     be usefully made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    First, both medical
     reports did <em>not</em> constitute <em>Baskerville</em> corroboration of the alleged rapes in so far as
     they were mere repetitions of a complaint made by C1. Accordingly, the
     inquiry turns on the extent to which they are supportive or confirmative of
     C1’s testimony at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    Secondly, both
     medical reports did not constitute either <em>Baskerville</em> or liberal corroboration with regard to the
      <em>first charge</em> involving fellatio in 1999
     since the incident was not mentioned in the reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Thirdly, the
     medical reports were found by the Judge to corroborate incidents which took
     place <em>between three and five years ago</em>. As
     mentioned above (at <a href="#p1_175">[175]</a>–<a href="#p1_176">[176]</a>), under s 159 of the EA, former
     statements may only corroborate <em>the same
      facts</em> if the statements are recorded <em>“at or
      about the time when the fact took place</em> or before any authority
     legally competent to investigate the fact”. In <em>Lee Kwang
      Peng</em>, Yong CJ (at [80],
     cited above at <a href="#p1_176">[176]</a>) held that two
     complaints in that case did not fall within the ambit of s 159 of the EA
     because “they were made so long after the alleged incidents.” On the facts
     in <em>Lee Kwang Peng</em>, the two complaints were
     made <em>one year and six months respectively after the
      alleged incidents</em>. <em>A fortiori</em>,
     the medical reports, which are based on interviews with C1, cannot, under
     s 159 of the EA, corroborate her account of incidents that took place
      <em>between three and five years ago.</em> Therefore,
     the medical reports do not provide a contemporaneous account of the
      <em>first four charges</em> and do not constitute
     even <em>liberal</em> corroborative evidence under
     s 159 of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Do C1’s hymenal tears amount to corroborative
    evidence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Dr Pang found at
     paragraph 7 of her report that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Her [C1’s] hymen was deficient posteriorly, with old tears at the
      2 o’clock and 9 o’clock position, suggestive of previous
      penetration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    In her testimony at
     trial, Dr Pang revealed that C1’s hymenal tears did not definitely mean
     that there was penetration. However, Dr Pang added that the “old tears at
     the 2 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions” were “more suggestive of
      penetration”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> although “[i]t doesn’t
     tell how many times of penetration has occurred”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    In the Singapore
     High Court decision of <em>B v Public Prosecutor</em>
     [2003] 1 SLR(R) 400 (“<em>B v PP</em>”), Yong CJ found
     (at [28]) that a medical report of
     a victim confirming a tear in her hymen was only relevant in establishing
     the fact that the victim had sustained injuries to her vagina. It was
     certainly not corroborative of the victim’s allegation that the injuries
     had been caused by the accused in that case. On the unique facts of that
     case, Yong CJ found this particular piece of corroborative evidence
     sufficient to sustain the accused’s conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    While we would
     agree that Yong CJ’s statement in the preceding paragraph, viz, that
     hymenal tears while evidencing sexual penetration, do not point to a
     specific perpetrator, is unimpeachable as a matter of logic, the evidence
     of C1’s hymenal tears cannot, in contrast to the facts in B v PP, be
     sufficient corroboration to sustain the Appellant’s conviction. Indeed,
     there are two critical distinguishing factors between the facts in B v PP
     and those in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    First, the victim
     in <em>B v PP</em> was three years old when she was
     medically examined meaning that there was next to no possibility that the
     victim in <em>B v PP</em> had been penetrated by
     someone else. In contrast, C1 was 16 year-old at the time of her
     examination. C1’s age <em>per se</em> would have been
     a neutral factor had it not been for the revelation of the school report
     and school counsellor’s statement that suggested that she had been sexually
     active by the time of her medical examination (see above at <a href="#p1_165">[165]</a>–<a href="#p1_171">[171]</a>). Secondly, the medical examination in <em>B v PP</em> was a contemporaneous report since the victim
     was examined a day after the sexual penetration had taken place. In
     contrast, C1 was medically examined close to four years after the last
     alleged rape.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    In this respect,
     the Judge rightly highlighted the limited probative value of such evidence
     and we respectfully adopt the same findings he made at [68] of the GD, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… while the hymenal tears indicated previous sexual penetration of
      the vagina, <em>they did not point to the Appellant being
       the perpetrator.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Did C1’s interview with the doctors
    corroborate her testimony at trial? </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Dr Pang’s report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    Dr Pang’s report
     can only be considered, in the words of the Judge, “by and large consistent
     with [C1’s] evidence in court” (see the GD at [68]) if one takes what Mr Singh has labelled as an
     excessively “broad-brush” approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    First, Dr Pang’s
     report is <em>not</em> corroborative of the <em>fifth charge</em> since the 29 April 2009 incident is not
     mentioned in her report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    Secondly, as
     highlighted above (at <a href="#p1_142">[142]</a>),
     Dr Pang’s report states that the first incident of penile penetrative sex
     occurred in 2003. The assaults would happen <em>four to five
      times a month</em> and stopped in 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> Dr Pang confirmed during two rounds of
     cross-examination that C1 had specifically given her this information
     during their interview.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> This is some way off from C1’s trial
     testimony that there were <em>two isolated rape incidents in
      2003, two rape incidents in 2004 and two rape incidents in
      2006.</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Dr Lim’s report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Similarly, Dr Lim’s
     report is inconsistent with C1’s testimony at trial on the following
     points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    First, Dr Lim’s
     testimony in his report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> and at trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span>
     recorded that C1 had stated, during their interview, that there were other
     “acts of sexual nature but which did not involve vaginal intercourse”.
     These occurred prior to 2003 when C1 was in primary four. During that
     interview, C1 had stated that she was not sure when those incidents first
     started. However, by the time of the trial, C1 was certain that the first
     incident of sexual abuse occurred when she was in her second year of
      kindergarten.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> This is significant
     inasmuch as C1’s recollection of past events somehow improbably became
     clearer with the passing of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    Secondly, Dr Lim’s
     report states that C1 had told C2 and her last boyfriend of the sexual
     assaults but made them keep the matter confidential. However, C1’s
     testimony at trial did not mention telling her last boyfriend of these
     alleged assaults<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> (see above at
      <a href="#p1_161">[161]</a>–<a href="#p1_162">[162]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the medical evidence and C2’s testimony
    consistent and corroborative?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    As would be
     evident, the Judge, with respect, erred in his finding that “[w]hat C1 told
     the doctors was <em>by and large consistent</em> with
     her evidence in court” [emphasis added] (see the GD at [68]). The significant inconsistencies in
     C1’s testimony at trial as set out above should have led him to the
     opposite conclusion. Further, the Judge had also erred in holding that
     Dr Pang’s and Dr Lim’s reports amounted to <em>corroborative
      evidence</em> in either the liberal or the <em>Baskeville</em> sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    C2’s testimony
     should also have been found to be inadmissible or assigned minimal weight
     as they concerned incidents which did not form the basis of any of the
     charges for which the appellant was convicted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    Finally, the Judge
     had also, with respect, erred in failing to consider that Dr Seng Kok Han’s
     medical reports on the Appellant could equally have “corroborated” the
     Appellant’s testimony, where he had consistently asserted his innocence and
     denied the charges against him (see above at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>). As Yong CJ held in <em>Khoo Kwoon
      Hain</em> (at [49]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I can see no reason why a s 159 corroboration of a complainant's
      testimony should necessarily carry more weight than a s 159 corroboration
      of the Appellant's denial. Both appear to me to be equally
      self-serving.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Did the Prosecution at the trial
    below prove beyond reasonable doubt that the complaint was not the result of
    collusion?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    In the House of
     Lords decision of <em>Regina v H</em> [1995] 2 AC 596
      (“<em>R v H</em>”), Lord Mustill (at 616)
     distinguished between two forms of “collusion”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the word ‘collusion’ ... may denote a wicked conspiracy in which
      the complainants put their heads together to tell lies about the defendant
      ... [and is also] wide enough to embrace any communications between the
      witnesses, even without malign intent, which may lead to the transfer of
      recollections between them, and hence to an unconscious elision of the
      differences between the stories which each would independently have told
      ... the two situations may be labelled<b><em>
       ‘conspiracy’</em></b> and ‘<b><em>innocent infection’
       </em></b><em>... ‘conspiracy’ [is] the deliberate and
       malicious fabrication of untrue stories whose details chime because that
       is what they are designed to do ... such cases ... must surely be a small
       minority by comparison with those where the witness statements show no
       more than the opportunity (although not necessarily the reality) of
       ‘innocent infection’.</em> [emphasis added in italics and bold
      italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    Where the
     allegation is one of <em>innocent infection</em>, as
     opposed to conspiracy or collusion, and there is some evidence suggesting
     the opportunity for contamination arising, for example, from the transfer
     of recollections between witnesses leading to an unconscious elision of the
     differences between their accounts, the court must always be alive to that
     possibility even if it considers the possibility to be slight. In such
     instances, the accused is objecting to the weight and not the relevance of
     the prosecution witness’s testimony. To put it another way, the accused is
     not challenging the evidence as an outright lie, but is saying that the
     degree of veracity of the evidence and the strength of recollection of the
     witness must be subject to scrutiny (see <em>Lee Kwang
      Peng</em> at [95]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    When the allegation
     is one of <em>collusion</em> properly so called, the
     burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there
     was in fact no collusion to make a false complaint because motive and
     conduct are “legally distinct concepts which ought not to be conflated”
     (see <em>XP</em> at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    In <em>XP</em>, charges of outrage of modesty were brought against
     a teacher-in-charge of a water polo team by seven of his students under
     s 354 of the PC. Rajah JA found (at [23]–[26]) that the
     teacher’s allegations of collusion, which were based on the students’ close
     friendship and their obvious resentment towards him for being a harsh,
     interfering disciplinarian who was strict with training and took upon
     himself the task of overseeing their studies, revealed a <em>“plausible”</em> motive (see <em>XP</em> at
      [24]). Accordingly, the evidential
     burden of proof should have shifted to the Prosecution to prove beyond a
     reasonable doubt that there was in fact no collusion. However, the trial
     judge in <em>XP</em> had erred in failing to
     satisfactorily explain the absence of collusion. As Rajah JA noted (at
      [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [The trial judge] took a broad-brush approach without condescending
      into the very specific charges levelled against the boys by the appellant.
      This lack of reasoning does seem to subtly suggest that she could have
      unconsciously erred in placing the burden of proof of collusion on the
      Defence, contrary to the stated rule....</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    In contrast, in
      <em>Lee Kwang Peng</em>, where three students brought
     nine charges against their taekwondo instructor for outrage of modesty
     under s 354 of the PC, Yong CJ held (at [104]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for the appellant both in this appeal and in the lower court
      also did not elaborate on how the second complainant could have persuaded
      the first and third complainant to bring false charges, nor did the
      appellant make any suggestions as to why the latter two boys might have
      been motivated to undertake this ordeal. This fact alone — the absence of
      a unifying motive amongst the complainants — eliminated any doubts that
      may have arisen out of the second complainant’s evidence and the evidence
      adduced by the appellant’s witnesses in contradiction of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, Yong CJ found that there had been no collusion on the
     part of the complainants since they did not have a “unifying
     motive.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    It is
     uncontroversial that <em>the defence</em> has
      <em>first</em> to establish that the complainant has
     a <em>motive</em> to falsely implicate the accused. As
     Yong CJ explained in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Goh Han Heng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 374
     at [33]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here the accused can show that the complainant has a motive to
      falsely implicate him, then the burden must fall on the Prosecution to
      disprove that motive. <em>This does not mean that the
       Appellant merely needs to allege that the complainant has a motive to
       falsely implicate him. </em><b><em>Instead, the
       Appellant must adduce sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise a
       reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.</em></b> Only then would
      the burden of proof shift to the Prosecution to prove that there was no
      such motive. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    We would agree with
     the general thrust of the statement quoted in the preceding paragraph in so
     far as the Prosecution ultimately bears the legal burden of disproving
     beyond a reasonable doubt the fact of collusion. However, the statement
     should not be interpreted as suggesting that the Prosecution bears the
     legal burden to disprove the allegation of collusion <em>only after</em> the accused has discharged his evidential burden by
     proving a motive for collusion to a standard that is sufficient to create a
      <em>reasonable doubt</em> in the Prosecution’s case.
     This would admittedly set the standard of proof too high. It is preferable
     to frame the accused’s evidential burden in terms of whether the
     complainant had a <em>plausible</em> motive to collude
     to bring false charges against him. Furthermore, the term <em>“plausible”</em> (see <em>XP</em> at
      [24] and [26]) should be preferred to “<em>reasonable”</em> in so far as it prevents the court from
     conflating the separate, and admittedly irrelevant, question of whether
     complainant’s motive to bring a fabricated complaint against the accused is
      <em>“reasonable”</em> in the sense of being legally
     and/or morally justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The shifting of the burden of proof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Before examining
     the Appellant’s contention that C1’s complaint was fabricated, we pause to
     note that there is, with respect, an initial ambiguity in the Judge’s
     finding (see the GD at [63]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Other than the “grounding” in 2006, for which there was a valid
      reason, there was no suggestion that the Appellant was an impediment to
      her lifestyle. <em>Indeed, the Appellant was at a loss when
       asked for the reasons why he thought C1 would be making such serious
       false allegations against him</em> ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As a matter of logic, the question as to whether C1 had a motive for
     making false allegations against the Appellant must, ultimately, involve an
     objective inquiry. The fact that the Appellant, who was unrepresented at
     the time, was unable to discern such a motive is neither here nor there.
     Nevertheless, as discussed above at <a href="#p1_216">[216]</a>, the Appellant does bear an <em>evidential burden</em> to provide a plausible motive for collusion.
     There also remains, in the final analysis, the clear rule that the
      <em>evidential burden</em> shifts to the Prosecution
     to disprove the fact of collusion beyond a reasonable doubt (see <em>XP</em> at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    More importantly,
     the line of inquiry adopted by the Judge suggests that he may, with
     respect, have erred in placing the legal burden of proof of collusion on
     the Appellant by focussing on <em>why</em> the
     Appellant <em>thought</em> C1 would be making such
     serious false allegations against him instead of <em>whether</em> there <em>objectively</em>
     existed a plausible motive for C1 and the mother to falsely implicate the
     Appellant. Besides, there may be any number of explanations why the
     Appellant was at a loss when asked why he thought C1 would make such false
     allegations against him. The short answer could well be that, as defence
     counsel suggested; he was simply oblivious to the collusion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> Consequently, this line of enquiry may
     have led the Judge to inadvertently overlook the possibility that at the
     time when C1 reported the alleged incidents to the police, she was either
     not aware of or had failed to think through the consequences of her
     actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    The Judge’s later
     comments (at [65] of the GD) lends
     further weight to the suggestion that he had erroneously reversed the
     burden of proof for collusion:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Appellant’s inability to put any questions to C1 about the
      alleged sexual assaults during the first hearing was intriguing. He was
      not highly educated but was certainly no moron. <em>When
       invited by the court to challenge C1’s testimony and to suggest to her
       that perhaps she was lying about all or some of the allegations in the
       charges, he chose not to do so or to ask her any question regarding the
       crucial matters. I therefore agreed with the prosecution that the
       Appellant’s subsequent evidence about all the possible reasons why C1
       could be fabricating evidence against him invited scepticism</em>
      ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    With respect, it is
     not clear <em>how</em> the Appellant’s subsequent
     evidence concerning the possibility of collusion “invited scepticism”.
     First, the fact that this allegation only emerged after the Appellant
     engaged counsel must surely be a neutral factor at best.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    Secondly, the Judge
     did not mention the testimonies of the Appellant’s three witnesses, and
     hence did not assess their credibility in the reasons found in his GD (see
     above at <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> and <a href="#p1_81">[81]</a>). In doing so, the Judge dismissed
     Appellant’s evidence on collusion without condescending to its details.
     This is significant because all three of the Appellant’s witnesses’
     testimonies focused on the issue of collusion in general and the
     relationship between the mother and Lathiff in particular (see above at
      <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>–<a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>). More to the point, there were significant allegations
     in their testimonies that went unchallenged by the Prosecution and were
     therefore implicitly accepted, namely that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_221-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lathiff had
      first met the mother when she reported the loss of her IC (the sister’s
      testimony). This leaves open the possibility that their relationship began
      prior to 29 April 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_221-p2_b"></a>(b)     During the 27 June 2009 meeting, the
      mother had stated that she would be willing to drop the charges against
      the Appellant if he divorced her (the sister’s and her husband’s
      testimony). Although this stops short of admitting that the charges were
      fabricated, the fact that the mother was willing to use the charges as a
      bargaining chip to obtain a divorce is troubling;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_221-p2_c"></a>(c)     Lathiff and the
      mother were romantically involved and had married in Batam (the sister’s
      and her husband’s testimony). This directly contradicts the mother, C1 and
      Lathiff’s testimony that the couple were not in a “love relationship”. It
      also contradicts the mother and Lathiff’s account that the Batam marriage
      was simply a “plot” to rouse the Appellant’s parents’
     jealousy;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_221-p2_d"></a>(d)     Lathiff is a father figure to the children whom they
      addressed as <em>“Baba”</em> (the sister’s and her
      husband’s testimony). This directly contradicts the mother, Lathiff and
      C1’s testimony during the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    In fact, the
     Prosecution had been made aware of the risks of failing to challenge these
     points during the trial but had chosen not to do so (see above at <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>). First, during the examination in-chief,
     the Prosecution raised an objection to the sister’s testimony in relation
     to the 27 June 2009 meeting (see above at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>), on the basis that it was a “very peripheral area and
     really not relevant to the proceedings that is now before the
      Court”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, the Judge directed that
     the Prosecution could either make their submission subsequently or choose
     not to cross-examine her if indeed it was a “peripheral area”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> Second, during the second hearing before
     this court, the Prosecution accepted that the failure to specifically
     challenge the Appellant’s witnesses on these crucial points during the
     trial carried the implication that the Prosecution had accepted their
     testimonies on those so-called “peripheral area[s]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    Third, the
     Appellant could not be said to have “chose[n]” not to question C1 in any
     meaningful sense of the word. Despite the Judge’s attempt to facilitate the
     Appellant’s efforts at cross-examination, it was plain, and the Appellant
     stated as much, that he did not know how to challenge C1’s
      evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> It is difficult to see why this
     explanation proffered by the Appellant should be viewed with “scepticism”
     given that the gravity of the charges he faced could have easily overawed
     anyone – not least someone with only a secondary two education like the
     Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    Finally and most
     significantly, the revelation of the HSA investigation only came to light
     at the end of the Prosecution’s case (see above at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>–<a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>), which meant
     that the Appellant’s then counsel was unable to cross-examine the mother
     and Lathiff on it. This substantially deprived the Appellant of the
     opportunity to fully develop his case on collusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    Another possible
     reading of the abovementioned passages in the GD (see above at <a href="#p1_217">[217]</a> and <a href="#p1_219">[219]</a>) is that the Judge had actually found that the Appellant
     had failed to discharge the prior evidential burden of raising a plausible
     case of collusion. For the sake of completeness, we will assume the latter
     reading to be the Judge’s final position on the matter and propose to
     examine the substantive issue of collusion from that
    perspective.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">C1 and the mother’s motive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    Defence counsel
     below submitted that there was a plausible motive for C1 and the mother to
     bring a false complaint against the Appellant. C1 testified during
     cross-examination that she was sad that the Appellant treated her less
     favourably than C2. Moreover, the Appellant was very strict with
      her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span> For example, the Appellant had
     grounded her for six months for allegedly running away from home and there
     were times in primary school when the Appellant would not let C1 have
     dinner until she had finished her homework.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> There were also deeper issues of
     resentment that went beyond mere teenage angst. In this regard, C1
     testified that the mother and the Appellant quarrelled frequently over
     money and the Appellant’s alleged extra-marital affairs with “Indonesian
      ladies”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> In fact, it was a quarrel between
     the spouses over finances that had sparked the mother’s and children’s move
     away from the flat prior to 29 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    The Appellant also
     admitted during cross-examination that the mother had made a police report
     relating to one of the assaults by the Appellant more than two to three
     years ago.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> On that occasion, the Appellant was
     also warned by the IO that his wife could have obtained a Personal
     Protection Order as a result.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> Moreover the Appellant proceeded to make
     an even more self-incriminating admission by conceding that these assaults
     went on even after the police report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    This troubling
     history of physical abuse deeply affected C1. In fact, by the mother’s own
     admission, C1 was acutely sensitive to this abuse to the extent that she
     did not want her mother and father to quarrel lest it resulted in her
     mother getting “hit”: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    More significantly,
     the mother’s answer highlights that C1 was very close to her mother. C1’s
     concern for her mother and siblings was also evident in her answers to why
     she did not want to tell her mother of the alleged incidents:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span></p>

        would ask my father and I’m afraid that my father will beat her up. So

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    Similarly, when C1

     father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    Considering the

     took place on 2 February 2010, around nine months after the Appellant’s
     arrest. The mother testified that she had commenced proceedings in the
     Syariah Court because she could not tolerate the physical abuse by the
     Appellant; his financial irresponsibility towards their family; and the
     allegations of rape. However, she agreed that the divorce was granted
     without the court requiring her to prove her allegations since all that was
     required was for the Appellant to pronounce the <em>“talak”.</em> The Syriah Court papers exhibited in the trial below
     similarly do not disclose any grounds for the divorce.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Major and minor collusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    Defence counsel
     advanced two arguments in support of his contention that C1’s complaints
     were fabricated. In the interest of convenience, we have labelled them the
     major and minor collusion arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    According to the
      <em>major collusion argument</em>, Lathiff and the
     mother had a <em>pre-existing romantic relationship prior to
      the arrest</em> and that they had manipulated C1 to make a false
     complaint against the Appellant. In short, C1 was putty in the hands of the
     mother she loved and had wanted to protect. In the meantime, the mother had
     every reason to ensure that the Appellant would be convicted given his
     history of martial violence, his string of affairs and her desire to be
     with Lathiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    However, there are
     a number of wrinkles in the manner in which the collusion argument was
     presented in the trial below which have led us to refrain from making a
     conclusive finding as to whether there was <em>in
      fact</em> major collusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    First, the major
     collusion argument was not fully ventilated in the trial below. The defence
     counsel’s initial position after being engaged by the Appellant was that
     Lathiff and the mother were in a “love relationship” <em>“at
      least from the time of arrest of</em> [<em>the
      Appellant</em>]<em>”</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added]. That said, the major
     collusion argument was alluded to at various points throughout the trial.
     For instance, it was expressly put to Lathiff that the mother and he had
     met before the report was made, which he denied.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, defence counsel did not
     press the mother on her testimony that she had only befriended Lathiff two
     months after the report was made – following which, they subsequently went
     out for drinks on a number of occasions and the mother went so far as to
     invite Lathiff over to the flat on a number of occasions where he met her
     children, including C1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> Further, it was also never directly put to
     C1 that she had fabricated the evidence to get rid of the Appellant so that
     the mother could be with Lathiff. It was only after the revelation of C1’s
     HSA statement that defence counsel explicitly submitted that Lathiff, the
     mother and C1 had colluded to bring fabricated allegations against the
      Appellant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    Second, by the end
     of the trial, defence counsel appeared to abandon the major collusion
     argument in their oral<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> and written<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span>
     closing submissions. Instead, defence counsel’s submissions focussed on the
     more modest <em>minor collusion argument</em>: even if
     Lathiff had only become friends with the mother two months after the report
     was made, Lathiff’s close relationship with C1 gave rise to the real
     concern that Lathiff could have facilitated this fabrication, during
     investigation and at the trial by tutoring C1, C2 and the mother on to how
     to prepare for their police statements and testimony at the
      trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> After all, defence
     counsel argued, Lathiff had been a Senior Investigation Officer, presumably
     of some years’ standing. Lathiff would therefore have been familiar with
     the relevant processes and procedure of police investigation, prosecution
     and court trials. Moreover, on his numerous visits to the mother’s flat,
     Lathiff, by his own account, gave “advice” to C1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span> C1 testified that this “advice” covered areas
     relating to her schoolwork and future ambitions but they did not discuss
     the case against the Appellant with Lathiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> The latter point was repeated by the
     mother and Lathiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    A corollary of this
     is the subtler, separate argument that C1’s police statements and testimony
     at the trial itself were “contaminated” by Lathiff’s “advice” and
     discussions she had with C2 and the mother. This would be so even if
     Lathiff did not know of the plot to frame the Appellant but had unwittingly
     colluded. As stated above at <a href="#p1_211">[211]</a>,
     “collusion” is wide enough to embrace <em>“innocent
      contamination”</em>, <em>ie</em>, any
     communications between the witnesses, <em>even without
      malign intent</em>, which may lead to the transfer of recollections
     between them, and hence to a subconscious elision of the differences
     between the stories which each would independently have told (see <em>R v H</em> at 880, cited above at <a href="#p1_210">[210]</a>). Accordingly, the Judge’s finding (at [72] of the GD) that he:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… did not detect any hint that Lathiff, despite being the apparent
      father figure to the accused’s children, had <em>sought in
       any way to influence C1 or C2 in their testimony in court.</em>
      [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">should have been the start and not the end of the
    inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    A final misgiving
     that we have over the major collusion argument in particular and the case
     theory of collusion in general relates to the lack of evidence at the trial
     below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    As should be clear,
     the major collusion argument hinges almost entirely on the nature and
     duration, of the couple’s relationship, particularly, whether the mother
     and Lathiff had known each other <em>prior</em> to
     29 April 2009, Indeed, the deeper their ties, the greater the likelihood of
     collusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    By way of
     background to Lathiff’s and the mother’s relationship, the mother had
     testified that, sometime before her divorce, she told the sister (<em>ie</em>, the Appellant’s sister) that she was in a “love
     relationship” with Lathiff and that she intended on marrying Lathiff as his
     second wife. The mother subsequently asked for the sister and her husband
     to help to arrange a secret wedding for them in Batam.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> This was verified in Lathiff’s
      testimony.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> The mother also testified that at
     no time did she reveal to her sister in-law that Lathiff was the IO in her
     brother’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    It was only when
     the Judge asked Lathiff and the mother directly whether they had visited
     Batam together that they admitted that they had indeed travelled to Batam
     with the mother’s brother but only for “sightseeing”. Lathiff recalled that
     the trip took place on 12 July 2010 whereas the mother was clearly
      evasive:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    Somewhat
     coincidentally, Lathiff’s first wife did not come for the trip. The mother

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    This exchange
     between the mother and the Judge seriously undermines the mother’s overall
     credibility. If the mother’s testimony on this point is to be believed,
     then her ability to fabricate such “plots” and “games” in order to make her
     parents in-law “jealous” suggests that she could have similarly concocted a
     “plot” to get rid of her husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    On the other hand,
     if the mother’s testimony about the “plot” is to be disbelieved, this, at
     the very least, suggests that the mother and Lathiff were deliberately
     concealing the nature and extent of their relationship from the court. If
     there had in fact been a Batam wedding on 12 July 2010, this would raise
     suspicions as to the length of time they had known each other and whether
     there was a unifying motive to frame the Appellant. Indeed, the very short
     time within which they had grown from fast friends in June 2009 to a
     married couple in July 2010, whilst not impossible, does appear to be a
     little out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    At a more general
     level, the mother was less than forthcoming about her “friendship” with
     Lathiff. In fact, this “friendship” only came to light when she was
     recalled for cross-examination after the Appellant had engaged legal
     counsel. Even then, she remained evasive when questioned by both counsel
     and the Judge. Therefore, in light of the abovementioned evidence found in
     the <em>Official Transcript</em>, we respectfully do
     not share the Judge’s observation (at [72] of the GD) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [E]ven if the mother and Lathiff were not completely upfront about
      their relationship. <em>I accepted that any relationship
       between them developed only a couple of months or so after the police
       report was made by C1.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the contrary, the fact that Lathiff and the mother <em>“were not completely upfront about their relationship”</em>
     should have undermined, and not supported, the Judge’s belief that their
     relationship had only developed “a couple of months” after the police
     report was made. The fact of the matter is that there is nothing in the
     Official Transcript and trial exhibits to support Lathiff and the mother’s
     account as to the commencement of their relationship. Furthermore, it bears
     reiterating that the burden was on the Prosecution to prove that the mother
     and Lathiff’s relationship had not blossomed before 29 April
    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The new material</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    In the absence of
     any clear evidence on the issue of collusion, this court therefore
     requested fresh evidence. The new material that was disclosed by the
     Prosecution before the second CA hearing (see above at <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a>) also raises serious misgivings on making
     a conclusive finding on the issue of collusion.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_250-p2_a"></a>(a)     C1 believed
      that the mother married Lathiff in Batam and that, at first, she called
      the mother’s new husband “uncle” but subsequently called him “<em>Baba</em>”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_250-p2_b"></a>(b)     The mother had told C1 sometime in
      April 2010 that if the mother was ever caught for stealing cough syrup,
       “<em>Baba</em>” (Lathiff) would not admit to being
      the mastermind. The mother was also afraid to stop stealing because she
      was afraid that <em>Baba</em> would scold
       her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    The first piece of
     information serves to corroborate Lathiff’s and the mother’s 6 September
     2010 police statements in relation to the theft of cough syrup
     investigation where the couple had admitted to have been married in Batam
     (see below at <a href="#p1_258">[258]</a>–<a href="#p1_261">[261]</a>). Meanwhile, the second piece of
     information casts doubts on the Judge’s finding (see the GD at [72]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I] did not detect any hint that Lathiff, despite being the apparent
      father figure to the Appellant’s children, had sought in any way to
      influence C1 or C2 in their testimony in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In light of the fact that the Judge had sight of the <em>full</em> HSA statement, the question as to why Lathiff’s
     alleged domineering influence, did not extend to him exerting an influence
     over C1’s, C2’s and the mother’s testimony at trial in this case, ought to
     have been closely explored. Moreover, the Judge ought not to have ignored
     C1’s HSA statement given the Prosecution’s uncontested position that it had
     been voluntarily made by C1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The phone records</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    Unfortunately,
     because of the initial oversight in securing the relevant phone records
     earlier, the phone records currently provided by the Prosecution are of
     limited relevance. Lathiff’s only mobile line and one of the mother’s four
     mobile lines only have call records dating back to 1 September 2009. All
     records before that have been purged by the service provider. Further, two
     of the mother’s other mobile phone lines are pre-paid SIM cards for which
     call records are not available. Nevertheless, the available call records
     reveal that Lathiff and the mother were in frequent contact from the
     earliest date the call records started from (<em>ie</em> 1 September 2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    At the time of the
     second hearing before this court, the call records for the mother’s final
     mobile phone line were still pending and we were informed by the
     Prosecution that this number had initially been overlooked. This was
     surprising since this was, by the Prosecution’s own admission, precisely
     the mobile phone line that the mother had given to the police when she
     accompanied C1 to lodge the police report against the
      Appellant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_160" id="Ftn_160_1"><sup>[note: 160]</sup></a></span> Therefore, this
     was most likely the mobile phone line that Lathiff had initially contacted
     the mother on. As a matter of logic, obtaining the records for this
     particular mobile phone line should, in our view, have been a
     priority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    Consequently, there
     is no objective evidence to corroborate Lathiff and the mother’s testimony
      that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_254-p2_a"></a>(a)     They had
      first met when the mother and C1 went to lodge the rape report on 29 April
      2009; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_254-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lathiff had only initiated communications with the
      mother by calling her on her mobile phone in June
    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    Not only does this
     cast doubt on the Prosecution’s attempts to rebut the allegation of major
     collusion beyond reasonable doubt, it also irretrievably prejudices the
     Appellant’s ability to mount a defence should the issue be remitted before
     the Judge or a retrial ordered, an issue which will be considered in
     greater detail below (see Issue 4, at <a href="#p1_269">[269]</a>–<a href="#p1_309">[309]</a>
     below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Alleged police report for loss of the
    mother’s IC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    At the first PTC on
     23 August 2011, the Prosecution updated the court that the mother had not
     reported the loss of her IC to the police. In their further arguments for
     the second CA hearing, they elaborated that the IO had performed a
     screening for all police reports lodged by the mother and found no reports
     relating to the loss of her IC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_162" id="Ftn_162_1"><sup>[note: 162]</sup></a></span> However,
     this could equally mean that the mother had told the sister a lie (see
     above at <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lathiff and the mother’s passports for all
    travels they undertook in 2009 and 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    The travel records
     reveal that Lathiff, the mother and her brother had travelled to Batam for
     a day trip on 12 July 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_163" id="Ftn_163_1"><sup>[note: 163]</sup></a></span> This
     corroborates Lathiff and the mother’s testimony that they had all visited
     Batam together. However, the <em>purpose</em> of the
     12 July 2010 trip remains unanswered. Was it, as the mother testified, for
      “sight-seeing”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span> or to get secretly
    married?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Lathiff and the mother’s police statements
    recorded for the theft of cough syrup investigation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    In this respect,
     the new information from Lathiff and the mother’s police statements for the
     theft of cough syrup investigations shed some light on the true purpose of
     the Batam jaunt on 12 July 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    In Lathiff’s
     statement recorded on 21 September 2010 at 2.51pm, he stated that their
     marriage was solemnised in Batam on 12 July 2010. Similarly, the mother’s
     statement recorded on 21 September 2010 at 1.00pm stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On <em>12</em><sup>th</sup><sup> </sup><em>July 2010</em>, Mohammed Lathiff and I went to Sekupang,
      Indonesia <em>for our wedding solemnisation</em>. I
      am aware that Mohammad Lathiff is legally married in Singapore. His wife
      and 4 children are staying somewhere in Woodlands. We had planned to get
      married somewhere in June 2010. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    This is echoed, in
     the mother’s statement recorded on 21 September 2010 at 5.35pm:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 12 July 2010, Lathiff, my elder brother, Noorizan and I went to
      Sekupang, Indonesia. Before we left for Sekupang, Lathiff and I had
      already [sic] <em>to get married</em> there since we
      are not allowed to get married in Singapore. My elder brother was the
      witness for the marriage. Since 12 July 2010, both Lathiff and I consider
      ourselves as husband and wife. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    The mother repeated
     this position in another statement she recorded later that same day at
      6.45pm:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_167" id="Ftn_167_1"><sup>[note: 167]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Since my marriage with Mohammed Lathiff on 12 July
       2010</em>, I had decided to put a stop to my theft of the Dhasedyl
      cough syrup because I know that it is a crimes [sic] and I also do not
      want to Mohammed Lathiff to continue making mistake. [emphasis
      added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_262"></a>262    However, Lathiff’s
     and the mother’s account of their relationship underwent a dramatic and
     disturbing <em>volte face</em> when they were recalled
     by the police on 6 October 2010. The mother’s statement, recorded on
     6 October 2010 at 10.31am, claimed that while she had gone to Sekupang (a
     town in Batam) on 12 July 2010 with her brother and Lathiff, this was only
     to <em>“jalan jalan”</em> and not solemnise their
      wedding:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_168" id="Ftn_168_1"><sup>[note: 168]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">.... <em>Lathiff and I did not solemnise any wedding
       in Indonesia. I wish to state that I had lied that Lathiff was my husband
       because I was threatened by the investigation officer recording my
       statement as he said that he would remand me in the lock-up if I did not
       co-operate with him and that I would not be seeing my children that
       day.</em> As I know that Lathiff is an investigation officer from
      Ang Mo Kio Police Station, I thought that if I used Lathiff’s name, I
      would get sympathy from the police from Bedok Police Station. However, I
      did not know what I did would get him into trouble. As such, I made a
      story that Lathiff and I were married in Indonesia ... [emphasis
      added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263"></a>263    Somewhat
     coincidentally, Lathiff also retracted his earlier position. In his
     statement, recorded at 1.20pm that same day, Lathiff claimed that the
     mother and him were just “close friends” and they did not have their
     marriage solemnised in Indonesia. Lathiff also explained that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_169" id="Ftn_169_1"><sup>[note: 169]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I [Lathiff] said that I was the husband of [the mother] in my first
      statement because we had an agreement between both of us to let me act as
      a father to [the mother’s] three children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a>264    Furthermore,
     Lathiff claimed to have forgotten when he had gone to Indonesia with the
     mother – a surprising turn given that he seemed to be able to recall the
     date without much hesitation a month later during his testimony at the rape
     trial on 3 November 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_170" id="Ftn_170_1"><sup>[note: 170]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a>265    It is significant
     that both the mother and Lathiff admitted to their romantic relationship
     and Batam marriage when they were initially questioned by the police on
     21 September 2010. This was before they had had the opportunity to agree on
     what they should say to the police. It was only later, on 6 October 2010
     that these statements were retracted. However, the Prosecution in its
     Further Arguments has glossed over this by suggesting that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_171" id="Ftn_171_1"><sup>[note: 171]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The account given by the mother and Lathiff in their statements
      recorded on 21 September 2010, as to how they first met during the lodging
      of the rape report and subsequently developed a closer relationship, is
       <em>spontaneous and therefore reliable</em>.
      [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a>266    Admittedly, Lathiff
     has consistently maintained that he first met the mother when the rape
     report was lodged and only established contact two months
      later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_172" id="Ftn_172_1"><sup>[note: 172]</sup></a></span>
     However, it still leaves unanswered why the couple would lie about their
     relationship in their 6 October 2010 police statements when this issue
     would appear to have had no bearing on their guilt or innocence vis-à-vis
     that particular investigation. It is not inconceivable that, by this time,
     they might have realised its significant ramifications for the rape trial,
     which was still ongoing at the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_267"></a>267    Moreover, it is
     inaccurate for the Prosecution to suggest that the 21 September 2010
     statements were completely spontaneous and do not carry the possibility of
     contamination or collusion. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, by
     this time, the rape trial had already commenced on 23 August 2010. Lathiff
     and the mother had already testified as Prosecution witnesses on 23 and
     24 August 2010, respectively. At this stage of the trial, the Appellant was
     not represented and had yet to raise the possibility of collusion. However,
     defence counsel was appointed on 30 August 2010, and when the trial resumed
     on 3 November 2010, the revelation of Lathiff and the mother’s romantic
     relationship came to the fore when they were cross-examined that day,
     albeit with both denying having gotten married in Batam.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_173" id="Ftn_173_1"><sup>[note: 173]</sup></a></span> This might also explain why, in light of
     the growing scrutiny into the couple’s relationship, the mother and Lathiff
     were able to maintain a consistent position in their 21 September 2010
     statements that they had only become fast friends <em>two
      months after the rape report was lodged.</em> In fact, the only
     thing that had changed in their 6 October 2010 statements was the <em>nature</em> of their relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_268"></a>268    At this juncture it
     should be pointed out that the Prosecution at the trial below ought to have
     been aware, by the second tranche of hearings, that Lathiff and the mother
     had admitted in their 21 September 2010 statements to their Batam marriage.
     However, this was not revealed to the court either during their
     re-examination of Lathiff and the mother on 3 and 4 November 2010 or at any
     time after that. This meant that defence counsel was denied the opportunity
     to cross-examine the couple on this evidence and the Judge was not alerted
     to this disturbing development (see above at <a href="#p1_224">[224]</a>). Had Lathiff and the mother’s 21 September 2010
     statements been brought to the attention of the Judge and defence counsel,
     the line of enquiry in the rape trial would likely have taken a different
     turn and might have even led to the timely disclosure of the phone records.
     We also note that the Prosecution, on 15 November 2010, had rightly brought
     C1’s HSA statement to the court’s attention to contradict her trial
     testimony (see above at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>). This
     fact alone demonstrates that the Prosecution at the trial below ought to
     have been aware of the ongoing investigation into the theft of cough syrup
     although it appeared not to have <em>fully</em>
     appreciated its implications on the rape trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of findings on collusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_269"></a>269    To summarise our
     findings on the issue of collusion:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_a"></a>(a)     In our view,
      based on the available facts, there appears to be a case for alleging the
      existence of a motive for C1 and the mother to bring a false complaint
      against the Appellant – not least because of the close (and, indeed,
      romantic) relationship between the mother and Lathiff on the one hand and
      between Lathiff and the children (including C1) on the other. The issue
      then is when this relationship developed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_b"></a>(b)     However, the evidence
      adduced at trial was, in this regard, problematic. For an issue as serious
      as that of collusion the courts always seek clarity of facts. This court
      therefore requested fresh evidence. In this regard, given that a crucial
      issue (in so far as the major collusion argument is concerned) relates to
      the <em>time</em> at which the mother and Lathiff
       <em>first</em> established their relationship,
       <em>the phone records</em> were of <em>critical</em> importance – in particular, whether the
      mother and Lathiff had known each other <em>prior
       to</em> 29 April 2009 (when the mother and C1 lodged the rape
      report), in which case the major collusion argument would have been made
      out. Unfortunately, in the absence of the couple’s pre-1 September 2009
      phone records, there is <em>in</em>sufficient
      evidence to enable this court to ascertain whether or not the major
      collusion argument had in fact been established or disproved. It would, in
      our view, be unfair for this court (or, indeed, the trial court) to make a
      conclusive determination in relation to this particular issue simply
      because it was imperative, in the specific circumstances of the present
      case, that both parties be given an opportunity to address (through
      examination, cross-examination, re-examination as well as the relevant
      submissions) <em>all</em> the evidence (especially
      the crucial evidence, which, however, as just mentioned, was not (and is
      not presently) available).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_c"></a>(c)     For the same reasons, the evidence in
      relation to the minor collusion argument was also problematic and, hence,
      no conclusive determination could be made in relation to this particular
      issue as well. This would be an even greater exercise in speculation given
      that the minor collusion argument was only tangentially traversed by the
      Appellant’s witnesses’ testimonies, as evidenced by the sister and her
      husband’s evidence that Lathiff was a father figure to the children whom
      they addressed as <em>“Baba”</em>. Furthermore,
      defence counsel’s cross-examination of Lathiff, the mother and C1 was
      equally unfruitful with all three Prosecution witnesses maintaining that
      Lathiff did not facilitate any possible fabrication, during investigation
      and at the trial by tutoring C1, C2 and the mother on to how to prepare
      for their police statements and testimony at the trial. What we can say is
      that it is entirely unsatisfactory for an enforcement official who was
      plainly involved in the rape investigation at the outset to have developed
      a familial relationship with the two key witnesses while proceedings were
      ongoing. This has in turn raised many questions about the reliability of
      these individuals as they have quite clearly been selective in testifying
      on a number of key issues (see above at <a href="#p1_164">[164]</a>, <a href="#p1_245">[245]</a>, <a href="#p1_248">[248]</a> and <a href="#p1_265">[265]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 4: Should the Appellant be retried,
    acquitted or have the new materials remitted before the <em>same</em> trial judge, <em>ie</em>, the
    Judge?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_270"></a>270    In light of the
     above findings, parties were asked at the close of the second CA hearing to
     file written submissions on whether a retrial, remittance to the Judge for
     him to consider the new material or acquittal should be ordered.
     Accordingly, we now turn our attention to this question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_271"></a>271    The power to order
     a retrial when a conviction is quashed owes its origin not to the common
     law, but to the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure 1861 (Act No 25 of 1861)
     more than one hundred years ago. A similar power, albeit with minor
     linguistic differences, has subsequently been incorporated in the criminal
     procedure codes of a number of Commonwealth jurisdictions (see the Hong
     Kong Privy Council decision of <em>Au Pui-Kuen v
      Attorney-General of Hong Kong</em> [1980] AC 351 (“<em>Au Pui-Kuen</em>”) at 356).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_272"></a>272    In Singapore, the
     powers which this court may exercise upon quashing a conviction were
     previously found in s 54(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
     (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”) which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

      and may hear the appellant or his advocate and solicitor in reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The Court of Appeal may thereupon confirm,

       think just, and may by such order exercise any power which the trial
       court might have exercised.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_273"></a>273    Section 54 of the
     SCJA, along with the rest of Pt V of the pre-amended SCJA which concerned
     the Court of Appeal’s criminal jurisdiction, were repealed with effect from
     2 January 2011. Nevertheless, the (now repealed) s 54 of the SCJA remains

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_274"></a>274    The most extensive
     statement of the applicable principles in determining whether a retrial or
     acquittal should be ordered can be found in the Jamaican Privy Council
     decision of <em>Dennis Reid v The Queen</em> [1980] AC
     343 (“<em>Dennis Reid</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_275"></a>275    In <em>Dennis Reid</em>, the appellant was charged with murder. At
     his trial the appellant was convicted on the basis of an identification of
     him by a single eye-witness. The appellant’s conviction was quashed on
     appeal by the Jamaican Court of Appeal and a retrial was ordered on the
     grounds that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and unsupported by the
     evidence. The appellant then successfully appealed to the Privy Council
     against the order for a retrial. Crucially, Lord Diplock, delivering the
     unanimous opinion of the Board, held (at 348E–F) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would conflict with the basic principle that in every criminal
      trial it is for the prosecution to prove its case against the defendant,
      if a new trial were ordered <em>in cases where at the
       original trial the evidence which the prosecution had chosen to adduce
       was insufficient to justify a conviction</em> by any reasonable
      jury which had been properly directed...[T]he governing reason why the
      verdict must be set aside is because the prosecution having chosen to
      bring the defendant to trial had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to
      justify convicting him of the offence with which he has been charged.
       <em>To order a new trial would be to give the prosecution
       a second chance to make good the evidential deficiencies in its case -
       and, if a second chance, why not a third?</em> [emphasis
      added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_276"></a>276    Having disposed of
     the substance of the appeal, Lord Diplock went on to consider (at
     349D–351C) the principles which should apply in considering whether a
     retrial should be ordered:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships would be very loth to embark upon a catalogue of
      factors which may be present in particular cases and, where they are, will
      call for consideration in determining whether upon the quashing of a
      conviction the interests of justice do require that a new trial be held.
       <b><em>The danger of such a catalogue is that, despite all
       warnings, it may come to be treated as exhaustive or the order in which
       the various factors are listed may come to be regarded as indicative of
       the comparative weight to be attached to them;</em></b> whereas there
      may be factors which in the particular circumstances of some future case
      might be decisive but which their Lordships have not now the prescience to
      foresee, while the relative weight to be attached to each one of the
      several factors which are likely to be relevant in the common run of cases
      may vary widely from case to case according to its particular
      circumstances. <b><em>The recognition of the factors relevant
       to the particular case and the assessment of their relative importance
       are matters which call for the exercise of the collective sense of
       justice and common sense</em></b> of the members of the Court of Appeal
      of Jamaica who are familiar, as their Lordships are not, with local
      conditions. What their Lordships now say in an endeavour to provide the
      assistance sought by certified question (4) must be read with the
      foregoing warning in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships have already indicated in disposing of the instant
      appeal that the interest of justice that is served by the power to order a
      new trial is the interest of the public in Jamaica that those persons who
      are guilty of serious crimes should be brought to justice and not escape
      it merely because of some technical blunder by the trial judge in the
      conduct of the trial or in his summing up to the jury. <b><em>Save in circumstances so exceptional that their Lordships cannot readily
       envisage them it ought not to be exercised where, as in the instant case,
       a reason for setting aside the verdict is that the evidence adduced at
       the trial was insufficient to justify a conviction by a reasonable jury
       even if properly directed. </em></b><em>It is not in the
       interests of justice as administered under the common law system of
       criminal procedure that the prosecution should be given another chance to
       cure evidential deficiencies in its case against the defendant.
       </em><b><em>At the other extreme, where the evidence
       against the defendant at the trial was so strong that any reasonable jury
       if properly directed would have convicted the defendant, prima facie the
       more appropriate course is to</em></b> apply the proviso to section 14
      (1) and <b><em>dismiss the appeal instead of incurring the
       expense and inconvenience to witnesses and jurors which would be involved
       in another trial.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>In cases which fall between these two
       extremes</em></b> there may be many factors deserving of consideration,
      some operating against and some in favour of the exercise of the power.
       <b><em>The seriousness or otherwise of the offence must
       always be a relevant factor: so may its prevalence; and where the
       previous trial was prolonged and complex, the expense and the length of
       time for which the court and jury would be involved in a fresh hearing
       may also be relevant considerations. So too is the consideration that any
       criminal trial is to some extent an ordeal for the defendant, which the
       defendant ought not to be condemned to undergo for a second time through
       no fault of his own unless the interests of justice require that he
       should do so. The length of time that will have elapsed between the
       offence and the new trial if one be ordered may vary in importance from
       case to case, though having regard to the onus of proof which lies upon
       the prosecution lapse of time may tend to operate to its disadvantage
       rather than to that of the defendant. Nevertheless there may be cases
       where evidence which tended to support the defence at the first trial
       would not be available at the new trial and, if this were so, it would be
       a powerful factor against ordering a new trial.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The strength of the case
       presented by the prosecution at the previous trial is always one of the
       factors to be taken into consideration but, except in the two extreme
       cases that have been referred to, the weight to be attached to this
       factor may vary widely from case to case according to the nature of the
       crime, the particular circumstances in which it was committed and the
       current state of public opinion in Jamaica. On the one hand there may
       well be cases where despite a near certainty that upon a second trial the
       defendant would be convicted the countervailing reasons are strong enough
       to justify refraining from that course. On the other hand it is not
       necessarily a condition precedent to the ordering of a new trial that the
       Court of Appeal should be satisfied of the probability that it will
       result in a conviction. There may be cases where, even though the Court
       of Appeal considers that upon a fresh trial an acquittal is on balance
       more likely than a conviction</em></b>,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b><em>“It is in the interest of the public, the
        complainant, and the [defendant] himself that the question of guilt or
        otherwise be determined finally by the verdict of a jury, and not left
        as something which must remain undecided by reason of a defect in legal
        machinery.”</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This was said by the Full Court of Hong Kong when ordering a new
      trial in <em>Ng Yuk-kin v. The Crown</em> (1955) 39
      H.K.L.R. 49, 60. That was a case of rape, but in their Lordships' view it
      states a consideration that may be of wider application than to that crime
      alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships in answer to the Court of Appeal's request have
      mentioned some of the factors that are most likely to call for
      consideration in the common run of cases in Jamaica in which that court is
      called upon to determine whether or not to exercise its power to order a
      new trial. They repeat that the factors that they have referred to do not
      pretend to constitute an exhaustive list. <b><em>Save as
       respects insufficiency of the evidence adduced by the prosecution at the
       previous trial, their Lordships have deliberately refrained from giving
       any indication that might suggest that any one factor is necessarily more
       important than another.</em></b> The weight to be attached to each of
      them in any individual case will depend not only upon its own particular
      facts but also upon the social environment in which criminal justice in
      Jamaica falls to be administered today. As their Lordships have already
      said, this makes the task of balancing the various factors one that is
      more fitly confided to appellate trial judges residing in the
      island.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_277"></a>277    The relevant
     propositions from Lord Diplock’s observations can be summarised as
     follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_277-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the
      recognition of the factors relevant to the particular case and the
      assessment of their relative importance are matters which call for the
      exercise of the “collective sense of justice and common sense” of the
      appellate court (<em>Dennis Reid</em> at
      349D);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_277-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the danger of such a catalogue is that,
      despite all warnings, it may come to be treated as exhaustive or the order
      in which the various factors are listed may come to be regarded as
      indicative of the comparative weight to be attached to them (<em>Dennis Reid</em> at 349F);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_277-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, the cases can be
      classified according to two extremes. At one extreme are cases where the
      evidence adduced at the original trial was insufficient to justify a
      conviction (“category one” cases). In such cases, “save in circumstances
      so exceptional that ... cannot be readily envisaged” an acquittal and not
      a retrial should be granted. At the other end of the extreme, are cases
      where the evidence against the appellant at the original trial was so
      strong that a conviction would have resulted (“category two” cases). In
      such cases, prima facie, the more appropriate course is to dismiss the
      appeal and affirm the conviction (<em>Dennis
       Reid</em> at 349H–350A); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_277-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, in cases that fall between
      the two extremes (“category three” cases), the relevant factors include,
      but are not limited to the following (<em>Dennis
       Reid</em> at 350D–G):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_277-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       The seriousness and prevalence of the offence;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_277-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Where the original trial was prolonged and complex, the expense and
       the length of time for a fresh hearing;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_277-p2_d-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       An appellant ought
       not to be condemned to undergo a trial for the second time through no
       fault of his own unless the interests of justice require that he should
       do so;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_277-p2_d-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The length of time that will have elapsed between the offence and
       the new trial if one is to be ordered. Owing to the onus of proof which
       lies upon the prosecution, a lapse of time may tend to operate to its
       disadvantage rather than to that of the appellant;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_277-p2_d-p3_v"></a>(v)       Whether there was evidence which tended to support the appellant at
       the original trial which would no longer be available at the new
       trial;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_277-p2_d-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       The relative strengths of the case presented by the prosecution and
       appellant at the original trial, but, except in the two extreme cases
       that have been referred to (see above, at [277(c)]), the weight to be
       attached to this factor may vary widely from case to
      case;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_277-p2_d-p3_vii"></a>(vii)       There may well be cases where despite a near certainty
       that upon a second trial the appellant would be convicted the
       countervailing reasons are strong enough to justify refraining from that
       course. Conversely, it is not necessarily a condition precedent to the
       ordering of a new trial that the appellate court should be satisfied of
       the probability that it will result in a conviction;
      and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_277-p2_d-p3_viii"></a>(viii)       There may also be cases where, even though the
       appellate court considers that, upon a fresh trial an acquittal is on
       balance more likely than a conviction, it may be still be in the interest
       of the public, the complainant and the appellant that the question of
       guilt or innocence be determined finally by a trial court and not left as
       something which must remain undecided by reason of a defect in legal
       machinery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_278"></a>278    It should be noted
     that Lord Diplock was at pains to stress that this list of propositions is
     non-exhaustive (see <em>Dennis Reid</em> at 351A and
     349D–F). Indeed, as this appeal has vividly demonstrated, it would be
     churlish to attempt to set out a definitive list of factors that would
     comprehensively address all manner of scenarios that could arise. Simply
     put, the exercise of the court’s discretion, upon quashing a conviction,
     is, in the final analysis, a matter that calls for the exercise of “the
     collective sense of justice and common sense” of the court (see <em>Dennis Reid</em> at 349F and <em>Au
      Pui-Kuen</em> at 357D).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_279"></a>279    
          <em>Dennis Reid</em> was referred to in the Singapore High Court
     decision of <em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony v Public
      Prosecutor</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 900 (“<em>Ng Chee
      Tiong Tony</em>”) at [28].
      <em>Dennis Reid</em> was also implicitly endorsed in
     the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Beh Chai Hock v
      Public Prosecutor</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 112 (“<em>Beh
      Chai Hock</em>”) where Yong CJ at [38] cited the Ipoh High Court decision of <em>Chee Chiew Heong v Public Prosecutor</em> [1981] 2 MLJ 287 which
     had itself referred to <em>Dennis
    Reid.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_280"></a>280    In <em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony</em>, the appellant was convicted in the
     district court of voluntarily causing hurt as a result of an altercation at
     a traffic junction and was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. He then
     appealed against both his conviction and sentence on the grounds that,
      <em>inter alia</em>, the trial judge had unreasonably
     and unfairly entered the arena of conflict by excessively questioning the
     appellant through a total of 76 continuous questions covering 12 pages of
     the notes of evidence thus rendering the conviction unsafe. Lee Seiu Kin J
     quashed the appellant’s conviction and acquitted him on the basis
     that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_280-p2_a"></a>(a)     The offence
      of voluntarily causing hurt is a non-seizable one and may be compounded by
      the victim (<em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony</em> at [30]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_280-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was far from clear that a
      retrial would likely lead to a conviction because the case essentially
      turned on the evidence of the victim and the appellant (<em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony</em> at [31]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_280-p2_c"></a>(c)     The trial had taken place over a
      period of five months and the appellant had had his conviction hanging
      over his head for another eight months leading up to the appeal. As such,
      ordering a retrial would give the Prosecution a second bit of the cherry
       (<em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony</em> at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_281"></a>281    In support of these
     findings, Lee J referred to the decision of this court in <em>Roseli bin Amat and others v Public Prosecutor</em> [1989]
     1 SLR(R) 346 (“<em>Roseli</em>”). In <em>Roseli</em>, the four appellants were convicted of rape. On
     appeal, the appellants claimed that the trial judge had: (a) excessively
     interrupted and hampered the appellants’ counsel in their examination and
     cross-examination of witnesses; (b) unfairly and improperly cross-examined
     the appellants in a hostile manner including disallowing them to give
     evidence in their own way; and (c) made adverse comments of the appellants
     which strongly indicated that the trial judge had predetermined the guilt
     of the appellants even before he had considered all the available evidence.
     The Court of Appeal quashed the rape convictions on the ground that the
     trial judge had failed to keep an open mind and had adversely determined
     issues against the accused prior to the presentation of the case. Having
     regard to the long lapse of time since the alleged offences and the fact
     that the appellants had already served a term of imprisonment of over three
     years, the Court of Appeal decided against ordering a retrial (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With great reluctance, we have reached the unavoidable conclusion
      that the convictions should not be allowed to stand. Accordingly, we allow
      the appeal and quash the convictions and the sentences. <em>We have considered whether we should now order a new trial. In our
       judgment, having regard to the long lapse of time since the alleged
       offence and the fact that the appellants have by now served a term of
       imprisonment of over three years it would be unfair to subject them again
       to a long trial on the same charges. We therefore do not propose to make
       such an order.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_282"></a>282    In <em>Roseli</em>, the trial judge sentenced the four appellants
     to, respectively, imprisonment terms of between ten to 14 years and ten to
     15 strokes of the cane. It was with this reference point in mind that the
     Court of Appeal held that it would be unfair to the appellants to subject
     them to a lengthy retrial since they had already been imprisoned for over
     three years. As should be clear, the facts of <em>Roseli</em> bear some resemblance to those in the present appeal in
     so far as they both involved rape convictions, the imposition of lengthy
     sentences and a concomitantly lengthy period of imprisonment prior to the
     disposal of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_283"></a>283    In <em>Beh Chai Hock</em>, the appellant was convicted of
     knowingly furnishing false information to a police officer under s 182 PC
     in his statement to a Staff Sergeant Goh (“SSgt Goh”). The appellant
     alleged that the statement was given to a Corporal Lee (“Cpl Lee”) instead
     and as a result of inducement. The trial judge was of the view that the
     identity of the recorder was a question of fact and that there was no issue
     of voluntariness to be determined by way of a <em>voir
      dire</em>. If the statement had in fact been recorded by Cpl Lee, it
     would be excluded anyway because it was made to a police officer not of the
     rank of sergeant or above. On the other hand, if the statement was recorded
     by SSgt Goh, then the <em>voir dire</em> would also
     not be necessary since the appellant had only made allegations against
     Cpl Lee and not SSgt Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_284"></a>284    On appeal, Yong CJ
     quashed the appellant’s conviction but did not find that this was a
     suitable case for an acquittal and, therefore, ordered a retrial. Yong CJ
     explained (at [39]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Considering the circumstances of this case, however, one can clearly
      see that ordering a retrial would not be tantamount to letting the
      Prosecution have another bite at the cherry because it was really not any
      failing on the part of the Prosecution that caused the trial judge to err
      in law. <em>It is not that the Prosecution had relied on
       unsatisfactory evidence to prove its case. The trial judge had come to
       his own conclusion, without any submission as to its necessity or
       otherwise, that it would be unnecessary to hold a voir dire to establish
       the identity of the recorder of the statement.</em> At the same
      time, it is also clear, from the totality of the evidence adduced and the
      findings of the trial judge on the evidence, that the appellant's
      conviction is being overturned even though <em>his defence,
       which consisted mainly of a denial of the Prosecution's case, was not
       credible to any degree.</em> Therefore, this would be a suitable
      case to order a retrial. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_285"></a>285    In contrast to the
     facts in <em>Dennis Reid</em>, the Prosecution in
      <em>Beh Chai Hock</em> were not to blame for the
     unsafe conviction at the trial below. Rather, it was the trial judge’s
     failure to hold a <em>voir dire</em> that had
     compromised the safety of the appellant’s conviction. In this respect, the
     facts in <em>Beh Chai Hock</em> bear a closer
     resemblance to those in <em>Roseli</em> and <em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony</em> in so far as they were all cases
     where the fairness of the trial below had been compromised by the conduct
     of the trial judge. Nevertheless, Yong CJ’s holding in <em>Beh Chai Hock</em>, that a retrial and not an acquittal should be
     ordered, was entirely justified because, unlike in <em>Roseli</em> and <em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony</em>,
     this would not amount to giving the prosecution a second bite of the cherry
     since the appellant’s defence at the trial below “was not credible to any
     degree”. Moreover, although not expressly stated in the judgment in
      <em>Beh Chai Hock</em>, there was no issue, unlike in
      <em>Roseli</em> and <em>Ng Chee Tiong
      Tony</em>, of prejudice to the appellant arising from a prolonged
     delay in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286"></a>286    As can be distilled
     from <em>Dennis Reid</em> (at 350D, cited above at
      <a href="#p1_276">[276]</a>), a lengthy interval between
     the commission of the alleged crime, the date of the complaint or the date
     of the charge and a putative retrial can operate to the detriment of the
     Appellant in two ways.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_287"></a>287    First, as
     demonstrated in <em>Roseli</em> and <em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony</em>, the length of time that will have elapsed
     may be disproportionate to the Appellant’s sentence and/or ongoing period
     of incarceration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_288"></a>288    Secondly, there is
     also the separate issue of whether the Appellant would be irretrievably
     prejudiced by the fact that exculpatory evidence would no longer be
     available at the retrial. This latter point has been discussed at some
     length in two English Court of Appeal decisions, <em>viz</em>, <em>R v B</em> [2003] 2 Cr App R 13
      (“<em>R v B</em>”) and <em>Khalid Ali
      Mohammed Altaf v The Crown Prosecution Service, West Midlands</em>
     [2007] EWCA Crim 691 (“<em>Khalid Ali</em>”), to which
     we now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_289"></a>289    
          <em>R v B</em> was another rape case where the appellant’s guilt or
     innocence turned on the complainant’s testimony. The appellant was charged
     with sexually abusing his step-daughter. An application was made before the
     start of the trial that the proceedings be stayed as an abuse of process
     based on the 30 year delay between the alleged incidents and the complaints
     made. The trial judge refused the application and at the end of the trial,
     the appellant was convicted. The appellant appealed against his conviction
     on the ground that the evidence relied on was unreliable and unsupported by
     any independent evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_290"></a>290    In allowing the
     appeal and acquitting the appellant, Lord Woolf CJ emphasised (at [18]) that “<em>the passage
      of time in this jurisdiction has never been a ground in itself for the
      staying of a prosecution”</em>. Nevertheless, the appellant was put
     in an impossible position to defend himself owing to the delay. As
     Lord Woolf observed (at [28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case it has to be recognised that because of the delay that
      occurred, in our judgment the appellant was put in an impossible position
      to defend himself. <em>He was not, as Mr Jenkins</em>
      [counsel for the appellant] <em>says with force, able to
       conduct any proper cross-examination of the complainant. There was no
       material he could put to the complainant to suggest that she had said
       that something had happened on one occasion which could be established to
       be incorrect. There was no material in the form of notes that were given
       to the doctors which showed that she had changed her account. All that
       the appellant could do was to say that he had not committed the acts
       alleged against him. Mr Jenkins says that to say to a jury, when faced
       with allegations of the sort that were made here, “I have not done it” is
       virtually no defence at all.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_291"></a>291    In <em>Khalid Ali</em>, two appellants were convicted of various
     sexual offences against two complainants involving an incident in December
     1995. However, the first appellant was not arrested until 2004 while the
     second appellant, who was originally arrested in 1997, was only rearrested
     in 2004. The trial took place in April 2006 with the first appellant being
     convicted of two offences of false imprisonment and one offence of aiding
     and abetting rape but acquitted of another offence of rape. The second
     appellant was convicted of one offence of rape. Both appellants appealed on
     the grounds that important documents had been destroyed during the period
     of unjustified delay between the reporting of the alleged incident in
     December 1995 and the appellants’ being rearrested and charged in 2004.
     Absent such documents, they argued, the verdicts were unsafe. The
     appellants were acquitted due to three main factors in their favour, which
     will be discussed in turn below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_292"></a>292    First, both
     complainants (<em>ie</em>, T and S) had, after they
     had complained to the police, made applications to the Criminal Injuries
     Compensation Authority (“CICA”). S’s application still existed but T’s was
     no longer available. At the trial below, S accepted that her account in the
     CICA application was untrue and exaggerated. For example, she had falsely
     accused the second appellant of raping her “every five minutes of the day
     and nights with lots of different ones” (at [16]). In this respect, Moses LJ (delivering the unanimous
     opinion of the English Court of Appeal) acknowledged (at [34]) that while:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was, of course, a matter of speculation as to whether it
       [<em>ie</em> T’s CICA application] was consistent
      with the account T gave, both at the time when being interviewed on video
      by the police and subsequently, to the court. <em>But the
       fact that S’s account was untrue and exaggerated is relevant. Both girls
       were still friends, living near each other, so we were told. It is
       unlikely that they did not discuss their applications to the
       CICA.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_293"></a>293    Accordingly,
     Moses LJ noted that the delay, had irretrievably removed any opportunity
     for the appellant to investigate whether T had similarly lied in her CICA
     form, short of cross-examining T about it (see <em>Khalid
      Ali</em> at [17]). In this
     respect, Moses LJ held (at [39])
     that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the instant appeal there was no credible evidence which could be
      distinguished from the missing material. <em>T’s
       credibility depended, in part, upon the reliability of her account to the
       CICA. The mere fact that S’s account had proved to be false did not
       establish that T’s was similarly untrue, but it does cause us concern, as
       it seems to have done to the trial judge at the time of the
       ruling.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_294"></a>294    Secondly, the delay
     led to the destruction of the pocketbook belonging to one of the two Police
     Officers who initially attended to the complaints. This deficiency in the
     evidence was compounded by the fact these two Police Officers had, by their
     own testimony, erroneously interviewed the complainants together, thereby
     presenting the opportunity for contamination. Accordingly, the delay
     deprived the appellant of the opportunity of seeing whether any greater
     clarification was contained in the missing pocketbook. Such clarification
     was required given the other Police Officer (whose pocketbook was still in
     existence for the purposes of the trial) could not explain why his
     pocketbook referred to an unidentified “Aktar” and not the first appellant
     (see <em>Khalid Ali</em> at [19]–[20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_295"></a>295    Thirdly, the
     telephone records that could corroborate the prosecution’s case were no
     longer available. T and S were said to have found a telephone box and S had
     called a friend and told her to let S’s mother know where they were.
     Moses LJ expressed dissatisfaction (at [22]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he girls’ friend, to whom the initial telephone call was made,
      once traced by the defence, could no longer assist. The prosecution made
      no attempt to trace her at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Consequently, Moses LJ acquitted the appellants on the basis that the
     cumulative effect of the missing documents meant that the appellants could
     not be fairly tried. Put simply, “<em>there was no credible
      evidence which could be distinguished from the missing
      material”</em> (see <em>Khalid Ali</em> at
      [39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_296"></a>296    To summarise, from
     the cases referred to above, it is clear that where the evidence adduced at
     the original trial was insufficient to justify a conviction, such as in
      <em>Dennis Reid</em>, an acquittal, as opposed to a
     retrial, should ordinarily be ordered (“category one cases”). At the other
     end of the extreme, where the evidence adduced at the original trial was so
     strong that a conviction would have resulted, the more appropriate course
     would be to dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction (“category two
     cases”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_297"></a>297    Between the two
     extremes, the residual category of cases would include the following,
     non-exhaustive situations (“category three cases”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_297-p2_a"></a>(a)     Critical
      exculpatory evidence is no longer available <em>(</em>see, for example, <em>R v B; Khalid
       Ali</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_297-p2_b"></a>(b)     The fairness of the trial below is compromised by the
      trial judge’s conduct (see, for example, <em>Roseli;
       </em><em>Ng Chee Tiong Tony;</em> and
       <em>Beh Chai Hock</em>); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_297-p2_c"></a>(c)     The length of time
      before the putative retrial is disproportionate to the appellant’s
      sentence and/or ongoing period of incarceration (see, for example,
       <em>Roseli; Ng Chee Tiong
    Tony</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_298"></a>298    In so far as
     “category three cases” are concerned, the appropriate course would be for
     the appellate court to weigh the non-exhaustive factors enunciated by
     Lord Diplock in <em>Dennis Reid</em> (see above at
      <a href="#p1_276">[276]</a>), while at all times exercising
     its “collective sense of justice and common sense”, in order to determine
     whether a retrial should be ordered. With the above principles in mind, we
     now turn to consider the parties’ submissions on this particular
     point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Remitting the new materials to the
    Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_299"></a>299    The Prosecution
     maintains that the new materials, particularly, the school report, school
     counsellor’s statements, and C1, the mother and Lathiff’s police
     statements, should be remitted to <em>the same trial judge,
      ie, the Judge</em>, for his consideration because:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_174" id="Ftn_174_1"><sup>[note: 174]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_299-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant
      is relying on a large amount of new material that has only emerged on
      appeal thereby denying the relevant Prosecution witnesses the opportunity
      to respond to the new material. For instance, C1 ought to be given an
      opportunity to respond to the school counsellor’s statement so as to
      enable the Judge to determine the proper weight that should be attached to
      it; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_299-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant has relied on a new point that was not
      canvassed or pursued in the trial below, <em>viz</em>, the discrepancies in C1’s account of the frequency of the
      alleged assaults.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_300"></a>300    Regarding the
     Prosecution’s first submission, <em>viz</em>, the
     Prosecution witnesses should be given an opportunity to respond to the
      <em>new material</em>; remitting these issues to the
     Judge would, in our view, be redundant and inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_301"></a>301    It is redundant
     because the relevant facts contained in the school report and school
     counsellor’s statements can be clearly and objectively ascertained by this
     court without the need for a retrial. In this respect, it bears reiterating
     that the Appellant is only relying on these new materials for the very
     limited purpose of undermining C1’s trial testimony that she was not
     sexually active and that C1’s hymenal tears may not have been caused by the
     Appellant (see above at <a href="#p1_169">[169]</a>–<a href="#p1_172">[172]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_302"></a>302    It is inappropriate
     because remitting the matter would put the Judge in an invidious position
     as the new materials, particularly the school report and school
     counsellor’s statement, have the potential to unravel most of the Judge’s
     favourable findings on C1’s testimony. Moreover, it might be prudent, for
     the sake of completeness, to recall other witnesses other than C1 and the
     school counsellor. For example, Dr Lim and Dr Pang may have to be recalled
     to re-examine C1 in light of the newly disclosed school report. Thus, it is
     self-evident that the issues that would be remitted back to the Judge are
     not discrete – and limited – ones that, once decided, would enable the
     Judge to automatically arrive at a final decision, having regard to the
     findings already made at the original trial. On the contrary, all these
     issues are inextricably connected not only amongst themselves but also with
     the findings hitherto made by the Judge. Put simply, they are all of a
     piece – and an integrated piece at that. In these circumstances, to expect
     the Judge to disregard some of the findings he had made at the original
     trial whilst retaining other findings which are not impacted by the issues
     remitted to him, and then to make new findings on the issues remitted to
     him and to arrive at a final decision once again, would be to place him in
     an invidious (and, we dare say, impossible) position. We must express our
     puzzlement that the Prosecution would suggest such a course of action – let
     alone in the very strong terms they have advocated it. Indeed, in their
     further written submissions on this particular issue, the Prosecution
     argued that it would be “unprincipled and unjust” for the court not to
     adopt this proposed course of action and to acquit the Appellant
      instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_175" id="Ftn_175_1"><sup>[note: 175]</sup></a></span> On the contrary, given our findings above,
     it would be the <em>precise opposite</em>. Given (as
     we have explained above) that the Prosecution has fallen short of the mark
     in its attempt to prove its case against the Appellant beyond a reasonable
     doubt <em>even based</em> on the evidence before the
     Judge, <em>not</em> to acquit the Appellant would be
     “unprincipled and unjust”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_303"></a>303    Regarding the
     Prosecution’s second submission, <em>viz</em>, that C1
     should now be given the opportunity to explain the inconsistencies in her
     various statements and her testimony in court as such opportunity was
      <em>not available at trial</em>, we find that any
     failure to resolve this inconsistency at trial is attributable to the
     Prosecution’s conduct of the trial below. The Prosecution at the trial
     below led evidence from both Dr Pang and Dr Lim that C1 had told them that
     the rapes had taken place four to five times a month. This was neither
     challenged by the Prosecution during re-examination nor put to the two
     doctors that their reports may have been influenced by the CID Report or
     SOF which had been given to them prior to the interview. In this respect,
     it is paradoxically the Prosecution, not the Appellant, which has relied on
     a new point, <em>viz</em>, the innocent explanation
     thesis, which was not canvassed or pursued in the trial below (see above at
      <a href="#p1_139">[139]</a>–<a href="#p1_146">[146]</a>). At the very least, both parties have been remiss in
     this particular regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_304"></a>304    Further, C1’s
     account to the doctors of the <em>frequency of the alleged
      rapes</em> conflicted glaringly with a number of C1’s earlier police
     statements – a fact which only the Prosecution would (or ought reasonably
     to) have been aware of, since these statements were not disclosed to the
     Appellant either at the Preliminary Inquiry, the trial below, or during the
     period leading up to the second CA hearing (see above at <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a>–<a href="#p1_146">[146]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_305"></a>305    Admittedly, defence
     counsel below did not expressly draw C1’s attention to the inconsistent
     account she had given to the doctors regarding the frequency of the rapes.
     However, the Prosecution at the trial below were equally remiss in failing
     to clarify this point with C1 during re-examination especially given the
     marked inconsistency with Dr Lim and Dr Pang’s earlier testimonies. At any
     rate, as Mr Singh persuasively put it: “it is difficult to comprehend what
     reasonable explanation C1 could possibly give to explain away the vast
     difference in the frequency in her different accounts of the alleged
      rapes”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_176" id="Ftn_176_1"><sup>[note: 176]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A retrial or acquittal?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_306"></a>306    We did, in the
     first instance, consider whether there ought to be a retrial before another
     trial judge instead of an acquittal. However, having carefully considered
     all the arguments and evidence as set out above, it was clear to us that
     the Prosecution at the trial below had failed to prove its case against the
     Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, as it had failed to adduce sufficient
     evidence to justify a conviction. Since this is a “category one case”, it
     would be wholly unjust to the Appellant to order a retrial before another
     trial judge (see <em>Dennis Reid</em> at 349H, cited
     above at <a href="#p1_276">[276]</a> and <a href="#p1_296">[296]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_307"></a>307    
          <em>Even if</em> it can be argued that the Prosecution at the trial
     below did not fail to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that
     this is in fact a “category three case”, falling between the two extremes
     enunciated above at <a href="#p1_296">[296]</a>, three
     factors militate against the ordering of a retrial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_308"></a>308    First, close to
     three years have elapsed since the Appellant’s arrest on 29 April 2009. The
     Appellant has been incarcerated during this entire period. Should the
     Appellant be acquitted after a retrial, he would have been unjustifiably
     detained for a prolonged period of time. This would be a grave injustice to
     the Appellant. Moreover, the delay is not of the Appellant’s own doing. The
     phone records were requested from the Prosecution during the CA’s first
     round of requests on 29 July 2010. However, it was not until we pressed the
     Prosecution for a conclusive response on their status at the second hearing
     before this court that we were informed on 9 February 2012 that the
     remaining phone records were unavailable. In these circumstances, the
     consequences for any delays in the disposal of this appeal should not be
     borne by the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_309"></a>309    Secondly, the
     Appellant has been – and will be –
     irretrievably prejudiced in a retrial because crucial exculpatory evidence,
     in the form of the pre-September 2009 phone records, is no longer
     available. In response, the Prosecution submits that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_177" id="Ftn_177_1"><sup>[note: 177]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems unprincipled and extremely prejudicial to the prosecution
      for the appellant to now assert that he is prejudiced by the
      non-availability of the call records when <em>he did not
       request for the records at the trial below to pursue the point he was
       seeking to raise in his defence.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_310"></a>310    With respect, this
     is a flawed argument. The Appellant was under no obligation to request for
     the phone records at the trial below. The law on collusion is well settled:
     so long as the Appellant is able to raise a plausible motive for collusion
     it is for the Prosecution to rebut this allegation beyond a reasonable
     doubt. Accordingly, the onus was on the Prosecution at the trial itself to
     adduce the phone records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_311"></a>311    Thirdly, to order a
     new trial would be to give the Prosecution a second chance to make good the
     evidential deficiencies in its case. To name but a few examples, the
     Prosecution could have, with reasonable diligence, located C1’s
     ex-boyfriend and called him as a witness at the trial to confirm that he
     was told by C1 about the alleged rapes (see above at <a href="#p1_162">[162]</a>). He could have also confirmed that he
     did not have an intimate relationship with C1. Similarly, given the wholly
     inconsistent testimonies of Lathiff and the mother on certain material
     issues, it is not too much of a stretch to postulate that they may tailor
     their testimonies at the retrial in a manner that would be expedient to
     them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_312"></a>312    As mentioned at the
     outset of this judgment (at [1]–[2]), the vital importance of examining the facts in a
     granular and meticulous manner <em>as well as</em> the
     closely related need for the Prosecution to prove its case against the
     Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be emphasised enough. In our
     view, having regard to all the relevant facts, we find that the Prosecution
     has <em>not</em> proved its case <em>vis-a-vis</em> all the five charges against the Appellant beyond a
     reasonable doubt. The reasons for our decision have been set out in great
     detail above. In summary, we found as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_312-p2_a"></a>(a)     The evidence
      of C1 was <em>not</em> – as required by the
      established legal principles – <em>unusually
       convincing</em> and therefore could <em>not</em>, in and of itself, <em>constitute
       sufficient evidence</em> to establish the charges against the
      Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt (see generally above at <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a>–<a href="#p1_172">[172]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_312-p2_b"></a>(b)     The evidence of C1 referred to at (a)
      above has <em>not</em> been <em>corroborated</em> by <em>either</em> the
      evidence of C1’s sister, C2, <em>or</em> the medical
      evidence (see generally above at <a href="#p1_173">[173]</a>–<a href="#p1_209">[209]</a>). This is
      crucial, given our finding at (a) above (<em>viz</em>, that C1’s evidence was <em>not</em>,
      in and of itself, unusually convincing).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_312-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was, however,
      insufficient evidence for us to decide on the issue of alleged collusion –
      whether stemming from a pre-existing romantic relationship between Lathiff
      and the mother which led to the manipulation of C1 to make a false
      complaint against the Appellant <em>or</em> from a
      relationship existing after C1’s complaint had been made which led Lathiff
      to tutor the mother, C1 and C2 as to how to prepare for the police
      statements and their testimony at the trial itself (see generally above at
       <a href="#p1_217">[217]</a>–<a href="#p1_269">[269]</a>). What we can say, however, is that it is troubling
      that the trial process may have been compromised by the development of
      familial relationships among Lathiff, C1 and the mother (see above at
       <a href="#p1_251">[251]</a>, <a href="#p1_261">[261]</a>–<a href="#p1_269">[269]</a>).
      Nevertheless, this did not impact the decision of this court as, based on
      our findings as summarised above at (a) and (b), it is clear that the
      Prosecution had not proved its case against the Appellant beyond a
      reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_312-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the circumstances, ordering a new trial before a
      different trial judge or remitting the new materials to the Judge is
      inappropriate because the aforementioned findings were based on clear
      evidence from the record with the new evidence only confirming this
      conclusion – with the result that the Prosecution at the trial below had
      not only failed to prove its case against the Appellant beyond a
      reasonable doubt but had failed to do so by no small measure (see above at
       <a href="#p1_300">[300]</a>–<a href="#p1_306">[306]</a>). Further, as explained above, the fact that close to
      three years have elapsed since the Appellant’s arrest as well as the fact
      that the Appellant would be irretrievably prejudiced because crucial
      potentially exculpatory evidence is no longer available would, <em>in any event</em>, <em>also</em> have
      led to the conclusion that a retrial ought <em>not</em> to be ordered (see above at <a href="#p1_307">[307]</a>–<a href="#p1_310">[310]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_313"></a>313    In the
     circumstances, the appeal is allowed and the Appellant is acquitted of all
     the charges brought against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_314"></a>314    It cannot be
     overemphasised that the need to convict an accused person (such as the
     Appellant) based on the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is – as
     pointed out above – a time-honoured and integral part of our criminal
     justice system (and, to the best of our knowledge, all other criminal
     justice systems as well). In this respect, we adopt Lord Woolf’s comments
     in <em>R v B</em> at [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <b><em>We must do justice to the
       prosecution</em></b><em>, whose task it is to see that
       the guilty are brought to justice. </em><b><em>We must
       also do justice to the victim</em></b><em>.</em>
      In this case we are particularly conscious of the position of the victim.
      If she is right, she was treated in a most disgraceful way by someone whom
      she should have been entitled to trust: her stepfather. For years, for
      understandable reasons, as we have already indicated, she felt unable to
      make public what had happened. She is entitled to justice as well.
       <b><em>But we also have to do justice to the appellant.
       </em></b><b><em>At the heart of our criminal justice
       system is the principle that while it is important that justice is done
       to the prosecution and justice is done to the victim, in the final
       analysis the fact remains that it is even more important that an
       injustice is not done to a defendant. It is central to the way we
       administer justice in this country that although it may mean that some
       guilty people go unpunished, it is more important that the innocent are
       not wrongly convicted.</em></b> [emphasis added in italics and bold
      italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_315"></a>315    Indeed, any
     approach to the contrary would be wholly inconsistent with the presumption
     of innocence that is the <em>necessary</em> hallmark
     of any criminal justice system. It is precisely this presumption that
     underlies the fundamental principle set out at the outset of this Judgment
     (see above at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>) – that the
     Prosecution bears the legal burden of proving its case against the accused
     (here, the Appellant) <em>beyond a reasonable
      doubt</em>. In this regard, the following observations by
     V K Rajah J in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnamsamy v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
     4 SLR(R) 45 (at [58]–[60]) ought to be noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">58    In deciding whether the evidence supports a
       conviction beyond reasonable doubt, it is not only necessary to clarify
       the conceptual dividing line between reasonable doubts and mere or
       fanciful doubts. <b><em>It is also vital to appreciate that
        the principle that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving its case
        beyond reasonable doubt embodies two important societal
        values.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">59    First, it “provides concrete substance for the
       presumption of innocence”: <em>Winship</em>
        [<em>In re Winship</em> 397 US 358 (1970)] at 363.
        <b><em>It is axiomatic that the presumption of innocence is
        a central and fundamental moral assumption in criminal law. It cannot be
        assumed that an individual is guilty by mere dint of the fact that he
        has been accused of an offence, unless and until the Prosecution adduces
        sufficient evidence to displace this presumption of innocence. That
        threshold below which society will not condone a conviction or allow for
        the presumption of innocence to be displaced is the line between
        reasonable doubt and mere doubt.</em></b> Adherence to this
       presumption also means that the trial judge should not supplement gaps in
       the Prosecution's case. If indeed gaps in the evidence should prevail so
       that the trial judge feels it is necessary to fill them to satisfy
       himself that the Prosecution’s burden of proof has been met, then the
       accused simply cannot be found legally guilty. In short, the presumption
       of innocence has not been displaced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60    
              <em>Second</em>,<b><em> the principle of reasonable doubt connotes and conveys the
        gravity and weightiness that society equates with punishment. It would
        be wrong to visit the indignity and pain of punishment upon a person
        (and his family) unless and until the Prosecution is able to dispel all
        reasonable doubts that the evidence (or lack thereof) may throw
        up.</em></b> Therefore, it is critical that trial judges appreciate
       that inasmuch as fanciful conspiracy theories, often pleaded by the
       Defence, will not suffice to establish reasonable doubt, the
       Prosecution's theory of guilt must be supportable by reference to the
       evidence alone and not mere conjecture that seeks to explain away gaps in
       the evidence. Suspicion and conjecture can never replace
      proof.</p>
