<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns an
                    application for a declaration against injunctive relief with
                    the ultimate objective of facilitating the realignment of an
                    access road occasioned by a proposed redevelopment. This
                    application is made on the authority of the decision of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Yickvi Realty Pte Ltd
                        v Pacific Rover Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 951
                        (“<em>Yickvi</em>”).
                    The defendant seeks to strike out the application on the
                    basis that unlike the present case, <em>Yickvi</em> was concerned with an <em>unregistered</em> easement and that in
                    the case of <em>registered</em>
                    easements, the court has <em>no</em>
                    power to permit such realignment under the Land Titles Act
                    (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       It is not disputed that no
                    distinction was made in <em>Yickvi</em>
                    between a registered and an unregistered easement. Neither
                    was the point raised that the court lacks power under the
                    LTA to modify registered easements. The key issue is whether
                    the fact of registration of the easement in the present case
                    would make the critical difference, as contended by the
                    defendant, warranting its striking out or whether it is, in
                    truth, a distinction without a difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff, a company
                    incorporated in Singapore and a wholly owned subsidiary of
                    Wheelock Properties (Singapore) Limited
                    (“Wheelock”), is the owner of Lot No 658X of
                    Town Subdivision 25 (“the Servient
                    Tenement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant is the owner
                    of Lot No 721C of Town Subdivision 25 (“the Dominant
                    Tenement”), a plot of land adjoining the Servient
                    Tenement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The existing easement
                    (“the existing Easement”) was granted on
                    2 January 1986 by the plaintiff’s
                    predecessor-in-title, Robin Development (Private) Limited,
                    to the defendant’s predecessor-in-title, Fu Yun Siak.
                    It was essentially an extended right of way (“the
                    path”) running across and connecting four adjourning
                    plots of land: Lot No 638 of Town Subdivision 25
                    (“Lot 638”), the Servient Tenement, the
                    Dominant Tenement, and Lot No 640 of Town Subdivision 25
                    (“Lot 640”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Access from the road
                    to the path is through Lot 638.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Sometime in 1995, a
                    condominium development (“the Heritage
                    Apartments”) was built on the Dominant Tenement. As
                    part of this development, an electrical sub-station was
                    built on the Dominant Tenement at the boundary with the
                    Servient Tenement in order to service the Heritage
                        Apartments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In 2007, Lot 638 was
                    redeveloped and the entrance to the existing Easement
                    located at Lot 638 leading into the Servient Tenement from
                    the road was closed. Nonetheless, the path continues to
                    provide access <em>only</em> as between
                    the Servient Tenement and Dominant Tenement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Pursuant to an en-bloc
                    redevelopment, sometime on or around 28 August 2006,
                    provisional planning approval was obtained by the plaintiff
                    for redevelopment of a new condominium project (“the
                    Ardmore Three”) on the Servient Tenement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The
                    redevelopment would entail realigning the path to optimise
                    the use of the land.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In 2011, the plaintiff
                    sought to negotiate with the defendant with a view to
                    reaching an agreement for the proposed realignment of the
                    existing Easement, but to no avail.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural History</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 13 December 2011,
                    the plaintiff filed an application for a court declaration
                    that, <em>inter alia</em>, the proposed
                    realignment can constitute no wrongful interference with the
                    enjoyment of the existing Easement and no reasonable
                    objection could be taken to the proposed realignment.
                    Alternatively, the plaintiff sought a declaration that the
                    defendant has no right to injunctive relief against the
                    plaintiff on the plaintiff’s undertaking to reserve
                    unto the defendant all rights under the existing Easement in
                    the proposed realignment (“the Main
                    Application”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 25 January 2012,
                    the defendant filed a summons (“Summons No 349
                    of 2012”) to strike out the Main Application under O
                    18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”), and/or for the court to determine
                    under O 14 r 12 of the ROC that, as a matter of law, the
                    plaintiff has no justifiable cause to apply to the court to
                    realign the existing Easement (“the Striking Out
                    Application”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the pre-trial
                    conference on 28 February 2012, the Assistant Registrar
                    (“AR”) decided that the Striking Out
                    Application and the Main Application should be heard
                    separately. The plaintiffs appealed against the decision of
                    the AR (Registrar’s Appeal No 75 of 2012) and the
                    matter came before me on 8 March 2012 (“the
                    8 March hearing”). During this hearing, the
                    plaintiff disclosed a letter from SP PowerGrid Ltd
                    (“SP Power”) stating that it does not have any
                    objection to the proposed realignment of the existing
                    Easement. Since the main user of the existing Easement was
                    SP Power, for it to gain access to the electrical
                    sub-station, this letter was clearly of some relevance. The
                    defendant’s counsel at that hearing, Mr Adrian Aw,
                    however, informed the court that the SP Power letter was not
                    previously brought to their attention. He further informed
                    the court that the existing Easement is not
                    “indefeasible”, that is to say, the path may
                    be realigned if the <em>Yickvi</em>
                    principles are fulfilled. No distinction was made at this
                    hearing between <em>registered</em> and
                        <em>unregistered</em> easements. On
                    the strength of the disclosure of the SP Power letter that
                    was not before the AR as well as the defendant’s
                    position that the existing Easement is not
                    “indefeasible”, I ordered that the Striking
                    Out Application and the Main Application be heard
                    together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Both applications came
                    before me for hearing on 3 April 2012 (“the
                    3 April hearing”). I directed the parties to
                    first address the court on the Striking Out Application. The
                    principal argument raised by counsel for the defendant at
                    this hearing, Mr William Ricquier, (“Mr
                    Ricquier”) is that the court has no power under the
                    LTA to modify <em>registered</em>
                    easements. This was the first time such a distinction was
                    drawn. I pause at this juncture to express some observations
                    of the manner in which this argument was raised as it
                    clearly took the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Quek Mong Hua
                    (“Mr Quek”), as well as the court, by
                    surprise given what had transpired at the 8 March
                    hearing. First, this was a complete reversal of the
                    defendant’s position at the 8 March hearing when
                    the defendant accepted that the existing Easement is not
                    “indefeasible”. Second, both parties filed and
                    exchanged skeletal submissions prior to the 3 April
                    hearing. The only hint of such an argument was in the form
                    of a solitary paragraph – almost an afterthought
                    – at the end of the defendant’s skeletal
                    submissions tendered just before the 3 April hearing,
                    whereas the rest of the skeletal submissions sought to deal
                    with <em>Yickvi</em> on its merits.
                    Third, as this was a completely new point, the court did not
                    have the benefit of the plaintiff’s submissions at the
                    3 April hearing, and this necessitated an adjournment
                    for both parties to specifically address this issue. As our
                    system of adjudication is adversarial in nature, it is
                    crucial for the court to have the benefit of submissions
                    from both parties in order to arrive at a properly
                    considered decision. There is little to be gained by
                    surprising the opponent with a fundamentally new point,
                    particularly in this case where the defendant had earlier
                    informed the court of a contrary position. Just to be clear,
                    I am not suggesting that litigants are not entitled to raise
                    new points of law at hearings. I am merely expressing a
                    strong recommendation that counsel should inform the other
                    party of new points of law <em>prior</em> to the hearing, especially if it
                    involves a significant departure from an earlier position.
                    This would assist the court in arriving at an informed
                    decision after taking into account arguments from both
                    parties and would also avoid unnecessary delays. The
                    necessity to adhere to this best practice becomes even more
                    compelling when the merits or lack thereof of the
                    defendant’s principal argument is carefully
                    scrutinised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Principles governing striking out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Under O 18 rr 19(1)(a) to
                    19(1)(d) of the ROC, the court may strike out any pleading
                    and dismiss the action on any of the grounds stated
                    therein. In this case, the defendant’s
                    application to strike out the plaintiff’s claim rested
                    on the premise that it discloses no reasonable cause of
                    action, is frivolous and vexatious and/or is an abuse of the
                    process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The principles governing
                    the court’s power to strike out a claim summarily are
                    well established. Such power will only be exercised in plain
                    and obvious cases, and the courts will generally allow a
                    plaintiff to proceed with the action unless his case is
                    “wholly and clearly unarguable” (see <em>Riduan bin Yusof v Khng </em><em>Thian </em><em>Huat and
                        anor</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 188
                        (“<em>Riduan”</em>)
                    at [6], citing
                        <em>Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra
                        Realty</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 844 at [31]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The question here is
                    whether the plaintiff’s cause of action is
                    “certain to fail” when only the allegations in
                    the pleading are considered (see <em>The
                        “Osprey”</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099
                    at [7]). In other
                    words, the plaintiff’s cause of action must fail as a
                    matter of law even without the need for the court to embark
                    on a factual inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Striking Out
                    Application is principally premised on the defendant’s
                    argument that, as a matter of law, the court does not have
                    the power to modify registered easements under the LTA. This
                    argument must be examined in the context of the Main
                    Application which it seeks to strike out. In this regard, it
                    is critical to bear in mind that the Main Application seeks
                    a declaration, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that the proposed realignment can constitute no wrongful
                    interference with the enjoyment of the existing Easement or,
                    alternatively, that the defendant has no right to injunctive
                    relief against the plaintiff (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). As such, the case would only be
                    fit for striking out if I accept the defendant’s
                    submission that a finding that the court lacks the power to
                    modify <em>registered</em> (as opposed
                    to unregistered) easements is <em>fatal</em> to the specific declaratory reliefs
                    sought in the Main Application. On the other hand, if I
                    accept the plaintiff’s submission that the Main
                    Application is <em>not</em> dependent
                    on the court’s determination that it has the power to
                    modify <em>registered</em> easements,
                    then acceptance of the defendant’s principal
                    submission is not <em>per se</em>
                    dispositive of the Main Application. In that event, striking
                    out would be wholly inappropriate, and, in which case, I
                    will hear the parties on the merits of the Main
                    Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I shall therefore first
                    deal with the defendant’s principal argument that the
                    court lacks power under the LTA to modify <em>registered</em> easements and, if so, whether it
                    makes <em>any</em> difference in the
                    context of the reliefs sought under the Main Application.
                    Before doing so, I should consider the preliminary question
                    whether the LTA applies to both registered and unregistered
                    easements and thereafter to examine whether anything turns
                    on the fact of registration.</p>

                    references to “easements” in the LTA apply to
                    both categories of easements. For example, s 63

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Similarly, the term

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Other provisions make a
                    clear distinction between unregistered and registered
                    easements. Section 105 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Release of
                            easements</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>105.</b> —(1) An easement

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Where an easement over
                            unregistered land is made appurtenant to

                            in any manner in accordance with
                        law. </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The reference to
                    “[a]n easement over registered land” in s
                    105(1) must be read to mean “a registered
                    easement”. This provides the justification for
                    “an instrument of release in the approved
                    form” – an unregistered easement is not
                    reflected on the land-register and therefore requires no
                    such instrument in the approved form, which is for the
                    benefit of the Registrar to cancel the registration or
                    notification of easements under s 106. The reference to
                    “an easement over unregistered land” in s
                    105(2) must, by definition, refer to “an unregistered
                    easement”. This is consistent with the explanation in
                        <em>Baalman</em> at 175: “In
                    the case of easements over Old System land appurtenant to
                    registered land, it is a matter entirely for the parties
                    themselves: the Registrar will not be
                    concerned”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Read as such, s 105 makes
                    a clear distinction between the machinery to release
                    registered easements (instrument in the approved form) and
                    unregistered easements (release under the common law),
                    clearly demonstrating that both categories of easements
                    operate within the framework of the LTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On the other end of the
                    spectrum, certain provisions in Part X of the LTA, which
                    “deals principally with easements created after the
                    land has been brought under the [LTA]” (<em>Baalman</em> at 158), refer exclusively
                    to registered easements. For example, s 106 provides for the
                    Registrar’s power to cancel registered
                    easements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Cancellation
                            of easements</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>106.</b> —(1) The Registrar
                        shall cancel the registration or notification of an
                        easement upon proof to his satisfaction that
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    any period of time for which
                            the easement was intended to subsist has

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    any event upon which the
                            easement was intended to determine has
                            occurred; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the easement has been
                            abandoned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Thus, in a situation where
                    an unregistered easement exists over registered land, the
                    provisions of the LTA operate to govern the registered land,
                    but the common law operates in parallel to govern the
                    unregistered easement. Such was the case in <em>Lian Kok Hong v Lee Choi Kheong and
                        others</em> [2010] 3 SLR 378 (<em>“Lian Kok Hong</em>”), where the
                    Court of Appeal decided that an unregistered easement over
                    registered land had been abandoned, making reference only to
                    common law principles of abandonment (at [22]–[32]). This was also the
                    case in <em>Yickvi</em>, where the
                    Court of Appeal considered only common law principles in
                    granting the declaratory relief in respect of an
                    unregistered easement following the English High Court
                    decision in <em>Greenwich Healthcare National
                        Health Service Trust and Quadrant Housing
                        Trust</em> [1998] 1 WLR 1749 (<em>“Greenwich”</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Indeed, it is my view that
                    the procedure of registration of an easement under the LTA
                    does not create an overhaul of the law governing easements.

                        3rd<sup></sup>Ed, 2009) at para 20.130 shares the same view:
                    “The LTA does not fundamentally alter the nature or
                    characteristics of easements in respect of registered
                    land”. Apart from creating a different method of
                    acquisition (s 97) and release (s 105(1)), the only other
                    discernible and discrete difference relates to the
                    extinguishment of easements: while under the common law,
                    mere non-user by itself, however long, is not sufficient to
                    establish abandonment of an easement justifying
                    extinguishment (<em>Lian Kok Hong</em>
                    at [24]), s 106(2)
                    of the LTA provides that non-user for more than 12 years is
                    sufficient to constitute abandonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is necessary to
                    highlight that the provisions of the LTA are not only
                    applicable to registered easements because the defendant
                    contends that the LTA does not expressly empower the court
                    to modify registered easements. As explained at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> to <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> below, I agree with the
                    defendant that there is no such express power under the LTA.
                    However, the same is true even in the case of unregistered
                    easements. Therefore, how does the lack of express power to
                    modify registered easements under the LTA impact the
                    plaintiff’s claim for various declaratory reliefs
                    under the Main Application?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does the court have the power under the LTA to
                modify easements?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I agree with the
                    defendant’s submission that there is no express or
                    implied statutory power to modify registered easements under
                    the LTA. However, my finding is not peculiar to registered
                    easements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     First, the internal
                    blueprint of Part X of the LTA points towards the absence of
                    any judicial power to modify easements. Part X contains no
                    express provision for the court’s power to modify
                    easements. The courts are slow to imply powers where it is
                    not expressly provided for in the LTA. In <em>Frontfield Investment Holding (Pte) Ltd v Management
                        Corporation Strata Title Plan No 938 and
                        others</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 410, the plaintiff
                    sought a declaration that an easement was extinguished on
                    the basis of, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    obsolescence, a ground that was not provided for within the
                    LTA. Judith Prakash J rejected this argument, explaining at
                    [61]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the law stands at present, I do not accept that
                        there is any doctrine that entitles me to do what Mr
                        Shanmugam wants me to. Case after case has emphasised
                        the value of an easement to the dominant tenement and
                        the weight of evidence that must be adduced to allow the
                        court to infer that the easement has been voluntarily
                        given up. Such a situation is inimical to any right on
                        the part of the court to unilaterally strike down an
                        easement because it considers the easement obsolete. In
                        other jurisdictions it has been found necessary to
                        statutorily empower the courts to do this. It is clear
                        that such powers do not spring from the common law as it
                        currently stands. <em>Our Parliament has
                            not given the court any powers of extinguishment of
                            easements. It has only empowered the court to, in
                            certain circumstances, extinguish or vary
                            restrictions on land which has been brought under
                            the land titles system. For the time being,
                            Parliament has not seen fit to legislate on the
                            extinguishment of easements for obsolescence. In the
                            absence of such legislation, I do not think that I
                            can, sitting as a judge of first instance, exercise
                            any such power</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Secondly, s 160 of the LTA
                    provides for a <em>general statutory
                        power</em> of the court to rectify the
                    land-register in limited circumstances. As the Court of
                    Appeal stated in <em>United Overseas Bank v
                        Bebe </em><em>bte
                        Mohammad</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 884 at
                        [43], this power
                    is only restricted to the registered proprietor’s
                    fraud, omission or mistake in the act of obtaining
                    registration of the instrument. It is clear that this
                    general power of rectification cannot be applied to modify
                    easements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Thirdly, the LTA confers a
                    discrete, or specific, statutory power on the court to vary
                    registered <em>restrictive
                        covenants</em> under s 140(5) which, as I will
                    elaborate below (at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>
                    to <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>), cannot be
                    invoked for easements. The provision reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Without prejudice to
                            subsection (1), upon the application of any
                            person interested in land affected by a
                            restriction, the court shall have power, by order,
                            wholly or partially, to extinguish or vary the
                            restriction, upon being satisfied
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    that by reason of a change of
                            user of the land affected, as approved by the
                            competent authority or the Minister for
                            National Development, as the case may be,
                            under the Planning Act (Cap. 232), the
                            continued existence of the restriction will
                            impede the development of the land for public or
                            private purposes; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    that the proposed
                            extinguishment or variation will not materially
                            injure the person entitled to the benefit of
                            the restriction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Next, both parties rely on
                    s 46 of the LTA for different purposes. Mr Quek claims
                    that s 46(1)(vii) (read in conjunction with s 160)
                    empowers the court to make “an order to rectify the
                    land-register” and that such power must necessarily
                    include the power to rectify any registered interest,
                    including registered easements. Mr Ricquier, on the
                    other hand, submits that s 46 of the LTA merely
                    declares the indefeasible nature of registered land subject
                    to the exceptions set out therein, including “any
                    subsisting easements” under s 46(1)(ii). As
                    explained at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above, I agree
                    with Mr Ricquier that s 46(1)(ii) is necessary to
                    preserve existing easements which, by definition, will not
                    be registered at the time of registration of the servient
                    tenement. I am not persuaded by Mr Quek’s submission
                    that the power to make “an order to rectify the
                    land-register” under s 46(1)(vii) of the LTA is
                    tantamount to a power to modify any registered interests
                    including registered easements. As explained at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above, such a discrete or
                    specific power would have to be statutorily provided as in
                    the case of restrictions under s 140 of the
                LTA.</p>

                modify easements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The absence of an express
                    statutory power to modify easements under the LTA should be
                    contrasted against the express provisions empowering the
                    courts to modify easements in Torrens statutes of other

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In almost identical terms,

                    1919) confers on the court the power to modify or extinguish
                    (wholly or in part) easements, profits <em>à prendre</em>, and
                    restrictions and obligations arising from covenants. The
                    position is the same under s 181 of the Queensland Property
                    Law Act 1974, s 84C of the Tasmania Conveyancing and Law of
                    Property Act 1884 (Act 19 of 1884) and s 90B of the South

                    other land”. Section 2(1) allows the creation of a
                    real burden as “an obligation to do something”
                    (s 2(1)(a)) or “an obligation to refrain from
                    doing something” (s 2(1)(b)), which clearly
                    refers to restrictive and positive covenants. Section
                    2(3)(a) allows the creation of a real burden which
                    “consists of a right to enter, or otherwise make use
                    of, property”, which clearly refers to
                    easements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It seems clear to me after
                    an extensive examination of the provisions in the LTA, as
                    well as Torrens statutes from various Commonwealth
                    jurisdictions, that in the Torrens system, the court’s
                    power to modify or extinguish easements can only be derived
                    from the statute itself. In the absence of an express
                    provision, the court cannot imply or import any power to
                    modify or extinguish easements into the context of the
                    LTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the power to vary restrictive covenants
                under s 140(5) is applicable to easements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Quek argued at the
                    3 April hearing, as well as in his further submissions,
                    that the statutory power to modify restrictive covenants
                    under s 140(5) of the LTA is equally applicable to
                    easements. I cannot agree with that proposition for a number
                    of reasons. First, it is clear from the parliamentary
                    debates that s 140 was introduced to empower the courts
                    to remove or modify only restrictive covenants. This was
                    explained by the late Mr EW Barker (who was the
                    Minister for Law and National Development) in the <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (2 September 1970) vol. 30
                    at col. 192): “This amendment will meet in some
                    measure the representations of the Law Society for the
                    enactment of legislation for <em>the
                        discharge or modification of restrictive
                        covenants”</em> [emphasis
                added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Secondly, the structural
                    framework of the LTA strongly suggests, if not dictates,
                    that restrictive covenants and easements are governed
                    differently: restrictive covenants are governed by Part XIV,
                    while easements are governed by Part X. This distinction is
                    accentuated by the different modes of cancellation of
                    restrictive covenants and easements prescribed in Parts XIV
                    and X respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Thirdly, restrictive
                    covenants and easements are inherently different legal
                    constructs such that they cannot be referred to
                    interchangeably:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
                        characteristics of restrictive covenants and easements
                        are different. An easement must have four
                        characteristics: (i) there must be a dominant and
                        servient tenement; (ii) there must be accommodation
                        of the dominant tenement; (iii) the tenements must
                        be owned by different persons; and (iv) the
                        easement must be capable of forming the subject matter
                        of a grant (see <em>Re Ellenborough
                            Park</em> [1956] Ch 131). On the
                        other hand, the burden of a restrictive covenant passes
                        in equity if (i) the covenant is negative in
                        substance; and (ii) it accommodates a dominant tenement
                        (see <em>London County Council v
                            Allen</em> and others [1914]
                        3 KB 642).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     The nature of restrictive
                        covenants and easements are different. An easement is a
                        species of real property that is “parasitic upon
                        the land” (see <em>London and
                            Blenheim Esates Ltd v Ladbroke Retail Parks
                            Ltd</em> [1992] 1 WLR 1278
                        at 1283) while a restrictive covenant is a right
                            <em>in personam</em> (a
                        contractual right) which may acquire proprietary
                        consequences (see <em>Tulk v
                            Moxhay</em> (1948)
                    2 Ph 744).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Fourthly, where other
                    jurisdictions had enacted Torrens statutes that similarly
                    provide for judicial modification of restrictive covenants
                    but not easements, it has been generally considered that the
                    power to modify restrictive covenants cannot interchangeably
                    be used to modify easements. The English High Court in
                        <em>Greenwich</em> at 1755C
                    recognised that judicial power to modify restrictive
                    covenants under s 84, UK Law of Property Act 1925
                    (c 20) (“UK LPA 1925”) could not be
                    translated into a power to modify easements. Similarly,
                    legislation in Ontario, Canada and Victoria, Australia only
                    allows for judicial modification of restrictive covenants,
                    and not easements (s 61 of the Ontario Conveyancing and Law
                    of Property Act, RSO 1990 (c. C34 of 1990) and
                    s 84 of the Victoria Law of Property Act 1958
                    (No 6344 of 1958) respectively). Although there appears
                    to be no case law on this specific issue, the Victorian Law
                    Reform Commission in its <em>Easements and
                        Covenants: Consultation Paper</em> (Victorian Law
                    Reform Commission, 2010) (“<em>Victoria Law Commission Consultation
                    Paper</em>”) stated at
                    paras. 16.23–16.25:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Section 84 applies only to the
                            removal and modification of covenants. It does not
                            apply to easements</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 84 of Victoria’s Property Law Act is
                        based on section 84 of the English Law of Property Act
                        1925. Many other jurisdictions whose equivalent
                        provisions were also based on section 84 of the English
                        Act have amended them to provide for judicial removal
                        and variation of easements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Easements and restrictive covenants serve similar
                        functions and there is no compelling reason why they
                        should not be subject to similar provisions for judicial
                        removal and variation. It appears that they are treated
                        alike under the NSW provision corresponding to section
                        84, where case law relating to the removal of covenants
                        is applied to the removal of easements to the extent
                        that it is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Fifthly, the statutes of
                    the various Commonwealth jurisdictions surveyed at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> to <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above also make a
                    distinction between easements and restrictions. If
                    restrictions are intended to encompass easements, it would
                    be otiose to refer to “an easement or to any
                    restriction arising under covenant or otherwise” (see
                    s 129C(1), Western Australia Transfer of Land
                    Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The court’s power to grant declaratory
                reliefs as regards easements </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Having arrived at the
                    conclusion that the court indeed lacks power under the LTA
                    to modify easements, does this determination oust the
                    application of the <em>Yickvi</em>
                    principles such that the Main Application is doomed to fail?
                    Not so in my view. To understand why I have reached the
                    opposite outcome having accepted the defendant’s
                    principal submission, it is necessary to revisit the
                    decisions in <em>Yickvi</em> and
                        <em>Greenwich</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In <em>Yickvi</em>, the Court of Appeal affirmed the
                    decision of the High Court in granting a declaration that
                    the owner of the dominant tenement was not entitled to an
                    injunction to restrain the owner of the servient tenement
                    from realigning a road which interfered with the enjoyment
                    of the easement. Effectively, the order paved the way for
                    the owner of the servient tenement to realign a right of way
                    running across the servient tenement. The court explained
                    the circumstances under which it would allow such a
                    declaratory relief, citing <em>Greenwich</em> at 1755 (<em>Yickvi</em> at [11], [13]): (a) the proposed realignment
                    does not substantially interfere with the enjoyment of the
                    right of way; and (b) the proposed realignment is
                    necessary to achieve an object of substantial public and
                    local importance and value. No argument was raised in
                        <em>Yickvi</em> that the court
                    lacked power under the LTA to <em>modify</em> the easement in question. In my view
                    it was not raised simply because it was irrelevant to the
                    issues before the court as I shall explain
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is pertinent to
                    highlight that in <em>Greenwich</em>,
                    the English High Court made the same declaratory relief as
                    in <em>Yickvi</em>. In granting the
                    declaratory relief, Lightman J observed at 1755C
                    that “there is (unfortunately) no statutory
                    equivalent in case of easements to the jurisdiction vested
                    by statute in the Lands Tribunal in case of restrictive
                    covenants to modify the covenant to enable servient land to
                    be put to a proper use”. Section 84 of the UK LPA
                    1925 confers the Lands Tribunal with the power to modify
                    restrictive covenants, but is silent on the power to modify
                    easements. No distinction appeared to have been made in
                        <em>Greenwich</em> between
                    registered and unregistered easements and in my view, there
                    is no intelligible reason why the distinction would make any
                    difference as there is no express power under the UK LPA
                    1925 to modify any easement, both registered and
                    unregistered. In fact, notwithstanding the court’s
                    finding that it lacked the statutory power to modify
                    easements, Lightman J nevertheless granted the declaratory
                    relief. In this regard, it is crucial not to lose sight of
                    the fact that the declaratory orders made in <em>Greenwich</em> and <em>Yickvi</em> were not to modify the easements in
                    question. Modification of an easement entails an amendment
                    to the terms of the grant of the easement (see, <em>eg</em>, ss 129C(6a) and (7),
                    Western Australia Transfer of Land Act. It appears that the
                    procedure under the LTA is a slightly more convoluted one:
                    parties, after reaching agreement, would have to apply for
                    release of the existing easement under s 105, and
                    subsequently register the new modified easement under
                    s 97). Instead, the orders in those cases were to grant
                    a negative declaration that the owner of the dominant
                    tenement was not entitled to injunctive relief in the event
                    the owner of the servient tenement should proceed to realign
                    the road over which the easement was enjoyed. It cannot be
                    overemphasised that the plaintiff here is seeking the exact
                    same relief which was granted in <em>Yickvi</em> and <em>Greenwich</em>. For this reason, the lack of an
                    express power of modification under the LTA is irrelevant to
                    the Main Application. In this regard, I agree with Mr Quek
                    that “there are no additional rights conferred or
                    liabilities imposed on either a registered easement or an
                    unregistered one so long as it is one subsisting at the date
                    when the land was brought under the
                        [LTA]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Yickvi</em> explained that,
                    because of the scarcity of land in Singapore, there is a
                    public interest element in allowing land to be developed to
                    its optimal potential as permitted by planning law, provided
                    that the party whose easement is affected suffers no injury
                    or inconvenience as a result, and a further public interest
                    to avoid litigation. Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Yickvi</em> at [15]–[16] made the following salient
                    observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We disagreed with counsel's submission that there was
                        no element of public interest in the present case. In
                        our view, there were <em>two</em>
                        elements of public interest in the present case. First,
                        because of the scarcity of land in Singapore, land
                        should be allowed to be developed to its optimal
                        potential as permitted by planning law and the claimant
                        suffers no injury or inconvenience as a result. In the
                        present case, the competent authority had already given
                        Pacific Rover permission to realign the original road
                        and, in our view, it was not reasonable on the part of
                        Yickvi to deny Pacific Rover the opportunity to do so
                        when it would not suffer inconvenience from the
                        realignment of the original road. Yickvi would continue
                        to enjoy a right of way over the realigned road. In
                        fact, Yickvi would stand to <em>benefit</em> from the realignment as it would
                        be getting a right of way over a <em>new</em> road leading to Newton Road.
                        Otherwise, Yickvi would have to incur more expenditure
                        in having to redevelop the original road to cater to the
                        needs of the occupiers of its new development that might
                        arise from the substantially increased usage as a result
                        of the new development on its plot.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second public interest element discernible from
                        the facts of this case was the avoidance of more
                        litigation over Yickvi’s right to enjoy the right
                        of way that might arise should the injunction be
                        granted. The circumstances in which the right of way was
                        granted to Yickvi’s predecessors in title have
                        changed dramatically since 1903 when it was first
                        granted ... and this might affect the degree to which it
                        could be enjoyed by the purchasers or occupiers of the
                        apartments under construction by Yickvi. The right of
                        way was granted <em>only</em> for
                        the enjoyment of the occupiers of <em>one</em> residential house on the Servient
                        Land. But, with the completion of Yickvi’s
                        development, at least ten households (as compared with
                        the original single household) would now be entitled to
                        enjoy the right of way. This could constitute excessive
                        use of the right of way not contemplated by the grant
                        (see this court's decision in <em>Lee Tat
                            Development Pte Ltd v MCST Plan No 301</em>
                        [2009] 1 SLR(R) 875) and might lead Pacific Rover, by
                        way of retaliation, to commence proceedings to restrain
                        Yicvki and its purchasers and/or occupiers from such
                        excessive use.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Main Application is
                    premised on satisfying the two public interests articulated
                    in <em>Yickvi</em> which is not
                    strictly before me in the Striking Out Application. They
                    would, instead, be considered in the Main Application.
                    However, I should add that at the 3 April hearing, when
                    confronted with the defendant’s new argument, I did
                    ask the parties whether the easement in <em>Yickvi</em> was, at the material time, registered
                    under the LTA as no distinction appeared to have been made
                    in <em>Yickvi</em> or even <em>Greenwich</em> on the effect or lack of
                    registration of the easement. Mr Ricquier invited me to draw
                    the inference from a plain reading of <em>Yickvi</em> at [4] that the easement must have been
                    unregistered. I was not prepared to draw any such inference
                    particularly when it was capable of verification by a simple
                    search. Pursuant to my direction, both parties have since
                    conducted the relevant searches and confirmed in their
                    further submissions that the easement in <em>Yickvi</em> was not registered under the
                        LTA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> It remains a common law
                    easement. However, having considered the matter further with
                    the benefit of full arguments from both parties, I concluded
                    that the distinction made no practicable difference to the
                    relevance or applicability of the <em>Yickvi</em> principles in the Main Application
                    (see <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> to <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For the reasons above, I
                    find that the defendant’s argument is without merit.
                    The lack of an express power to modify registered easements
                    under the LTA does not preclude the court from granting the
                    declaratory reliefs sought in the Main Application.
                    Accordingly, the defendant’s Striking Out Application
                    is dismissed with costs which I fixed at $10,000 inclusive
                    of disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Main Application will
                    be heard on a date to be fixed though I hope that with this
                    decision, parties can arrive at a sensible commercial
                    resolution. Though the merits of the Main Application have
                    not been fully ventilated before me, it seems clear to me
                    that the public interest element, on the facts of the
                    present dispute, is satisfied given the purpose to optimise
                    the redevelopment of the land. As for inconvenience/injury
                    to the defendant, I shall say no more other than to observe
                    that the main user of the existing Easement, SP Power, has
                    confirmed that they have no objection to its proposed
                    realignment. The defendant alleges that the proposed
                    realignment would effectively extinguish the existing
                    Easement. This is a curious submission since it does not
                    appear to be disputed that the entrance to the path from Lot
                    638 has been closed since 2007. There is no material before
                    me to suggest that the defendant or even SP Power has
                    suffered any injury or inconvenience arising from the
                    closure of the entrance. How would the realignment of the
                    existing path which would reopen the entrance cause
                    substantial injury or inconvenience to the
                defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     My survey of the Torrens
                    systems of other Commonwealth jurisdictions has revealed
                    that the power to modify easements is expressly provided in
                    most of them. I have not been able to discern any particular
                    reason why the express power has not been included in the
                    LTA. It is no coincidence that in the three Commonwealth
                    jurisdictions where no statutory power exists to modify
                    easements, namely, the UK, Victoria, Australia and Ontario,
                    Canada, the respective Law Commissions have taken steps to
                    address that lacuna in the law to “achieve the more
                    efficient use of the land subject to [easements]”
                    (see UK Law Commission, <em>Easements,
                        Covenants and Profits à</em><em>Prendre: A Consultation
                        Paper</em> (Consultation Paper No. 186) (London:
                    The Stationery Office, 2008) (“<em>UK
                        Law Commission Consultation Paper</em>”)
                    at paras 14.24–14.32; <em>Victoria Law Commission Consultation Paper</em>,
                    cited above at [47];
                    Ontario Law Reform Commission, <em>Report on
                        Basic Principles of Land Law</em> (Toronto: The
                    Commission, 1996) at pp 154–155). Indeed, another
                    compelling factor which the Court of Appeal took into
                    account in granting the declaratory relief in <em>Yickvi</em> was the public interest to
                    avoid litigation. As the <em>UK Law
                        Commission Consultation Paper</em> stated at
                    para 14.32: “to give free rein to [the]
                    self-help [mechanism under the common law] would in all
                    likelihood provoke disputes between neighbours, developers
                    and objectors that would tend to lead to contested
                    litigation”. Given the increased activity in the
                    property redevelopment sector, it is perhaps timely for the
                    Legislature to review the necessity to introduce into our
                    LTA the express power to modify easements. I believe it will
                    go some way to further reduce litigation such as the present
                    case.</p>
