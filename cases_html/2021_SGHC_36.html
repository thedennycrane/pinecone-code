Kannan had directed him over the phone to walk towards a block near 256 Punggol Way and to collect a bag that was near the electrical box. Kannan had told him to place the bag in Ashvin’s Unit.

The “stuff” was inside a brown bag and covered by a red plastic bag. Kannan told him to take a cab and head to the Unit to pass the bag to Ashvin, which he did. Kannan had instructed Arun what to do over the phone when Arun was collecting the “stuff”.

Kannan was also the last to leave Ashvin’s Unit and he had seen the block of cannabis when he went up to the Unit to take his phone. Ashvin and Arun had also used his phone to make calls to Malaysia to contact Dilip. Ashvin had also consumed “ice” and might therefore have become “paranoid” and “overstretch[ed] [his] thinking”.

During the case conference before me on 9 November 2020, Mr Goswami indicated that he intended to call Wong as a Defence witness but would only file the summons for Wong’s attendance after having interviewed Wong.

This fortified Ashvin’s plan to implicate Kannan.

In sequential terms, this took place before the photo board which contained Kannan’s photograph was even shown to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Both Ashvin and Arun gave evidence suggesting that Kannan had a forceful and assertive personality; he was not someone they could easily say “no” to. When Kannan insisted, Ashvin felt a sense of “helplessness” and felt that he was left with no choice but to agree to help Kannan. This was consistent with my observations of Kannan’s conduct and presentation in the courtroom. He was self-consciously relaxed while seated in the dock. He was loquacious and animated while on the witness stand, and uninhibited in his attempts to communicate with counsel in the midst of the proceedings. He exuded smugness and brashness. It was thus not at all surprising to hear Ashvin’s evidence that he felt pressured and obligated to accede to Kannan’s request for assistance when he saw Kannan in person (see [16] and [17] above).

It was also submitted that SSI Ismail, who was also the Investigation Officer, had erred in not sending the tape and only the strands of hair for analysis. Further, Ashvin’s DNA was also purportedly found on Exhibits B1, D1B and D1C. Ashvin had however testified that he threw Exhibits D1B and D1C, which were the “remaining of the plastic”, into the trash bag after Kannan had cut open one block of cannabis.

</div> The Defence submitted that an inference could again be drawn that Ashvin had unwrapped one block of drugs and thrown the wrappers into his trash bag. Kannan’s DNA was also not found on any of these exhibits. He asserted that he had sweaty palms and that therefore more of his DNA would have been left on the exhibits if he had in fact touched them. The Defence submitted that the results of the DNA analysis collectively showed that Ashvin was dealing with the drugs “as if they were his own”, undermining his claim that they belonged to Kannan.

Ashvin’s hair was detected on Exhibit E1 but this was hardly a surprising or revelatory discovery. I have accepted Ashvin’s evidence that Exhibit E1 was packed by Kannan in Ashvin’s bedroom. Kannan had obviously taken precautions to avoid detection while packing the drugs, such as by using tape taken from the Unit. Ashvin had also testified that he had picked up D1B and D1C to dispose of them and this would readily explain why his DNA was found on them. Just because Kannan’s DNA was not detected did not mean that he did not physically handle the exhibits, and whether any trace of an individual’s DNA could be detected would depend on various factors including the individual’s shedder status.

</div>As for Kannan’s assertion that his sweaty palms would have resulted in a greater likelihood of DNA detection, this was entirely speculative. No scientific evidence was adduced by the Defence in support. Mr Goswami had attempted to cross-examine Ms Wong Hang Yee, a forensic scientist from the HSA, on this point. Ms Wong’s response was that a person might transfer or leave behind more DNA on an object “if the person is a high shedder and<span class="font-italic"> </span>he has sweaty palms”. There was however no evidence that having sweaty palms alone would lead to a greater likelihood of DNA detection.

</div> In any event, this did not cause added prejudice to the Defence. Even if Ashvin’s DNA was found on the tape, this would not further strengthen the Defence’s case (or conversely, weaken the Prosecution’s case), given that Exhibit E1 was packed in Ashvin’s bedroom and the tape was taken from Ashvin’s Unit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Fundamentally, Ashvin’s evidence was largely consistent when viewed in totality. Ashvin came across as a forthright and candid witness, whose evidence was not shaken in cross-examination. He provided a detailed and consistent account of what had transpired on 2 and 3 June 2016 and offered clarifications and explanations based on what he could recall. I found no hint of evasiveness or ambivalence. There were no attempts to embellish his evidence or plaster over lapses or gaps. I was fully satisfied that he was a credible witness. I noted also that his evidence was corroborated by Arun’s statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I shall explain in due course why I found no reason for Ashvin, Arun, Vinod and Pravin to falsely incriminate Kannan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arun’s evidence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Turning to Arun’s evidence, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that Arun’s testimony should be constituted by the collective contents of his statements to the CNB which were admitted as substantive evidence pursuant to s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. Arun’s statements and Ashvin’s evidence were consistent on the key issues, namely, that a meeting had occurred at the Unit on 2 June 2016 where Kannan had, in Ashvin’s presence, instructed Arun to collect the drugs, and that Arun returned to the Unit after collecting the drugs and passed them to Ashvin, who stored them in the Unit. Moreover, Arun’s statements should be given due weight as they were given voluntarily, recorded close in time to the alleged incident and were cogent and coherent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Arun made no effort to conceal his unwillingness to testify in court for both the Prosecution and the Defence. His repeated claims in court that he could not remember what had happened on the day of the alleged incident were indications that he was unwilling to tell the truth in court. Having regard to s 147(6) Evidence Act, it was precisely because he was an uncooperative witness in court that recourse to his statements was necessary, and appropriate weight could be attached to the statements he had given to the CNB.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Arun insisted that he did not remember any details about the events of 2 and 3 June 2016. I found that he did so either out of fear or reluctance to implicate Kannan in open court, as Kannan was a distant cousin. There is no reason why the veracity of his CNB statements would be impugned due to his reticence in court, which was likely to have stemmed from his desire to adopt a neutral stance vis-à-vis Kannan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The settled law is that even where a witness is found to have lied on a matter, it does not necessarily affect his credibility as a whole. A court is competent to accept one part of the witness’ testimony and reject another (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Kwee Leong v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 281 at [15]). Arun had testified that he had lied in his statement about Ashvin supplying cannabis to one “Babu” because his own cannabis supplier “was still outside at that point in time” and he did not want to implicate his supplier.

</div> While there was indeed some communication between them in the lock-up, I accepted Ashvin and Pravin’s testimonies that the conversation was neither related to the case at hand involving Kannan nor about what Vinod and Pravin had testified in court. Even if it did relate to the case at hand, Pravin and Vinod had given evidence only in relation to Exhibit E1. They were in no position to offer any direct evidence about the events leading to Kannan’s arrest, of which they only had partial or hearsay knowledge at best.

The Prosecution submitted that Wong’s evidence was unreliable. First, Wong’s evidence was contradicted by Ashvin and Arun, as well as the escorting officers present in the van. After Wong had testified for the Defence, the Prosecution applied to call three of the four CNB escorting officers, namely Station Inspector Ranjeet Ram Behari, Station Inspector Chiang Jianwei Kevin and Senior Staff Sergeant Cheng Boon Keong, as rebuttal witnesses. All the officers had testified that no such conversation had taken place between Ashvin and Arun, and it would be inherently incredible that all the officers would not have heard a “protracted and audible conversation” between Ashvin and Arun and if they did, to not have sought to intervene. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Second, Wong had acknowledged that he had a history of suffering from memory impairment issues, stemming from a brain infection due to meningoencephalitis. Further, it was unclear how Wong would have linked Kannan’s case to that of Ashvin and Arun’s, given that Kannan, Ashvin and Arun were all arrested in different circumstances and locations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Third, Ashvin and Arun had consistently implicated Kannan in their respective contemporaneous statements which were taken before the trip to the CMC. Prior to their arrests, Ashvin and Arun would not have had an opportunity to come up with a plan to frame Kannan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Conversely, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution was unable to show that Wong could not remember what had happened during the trip to the CMC as a result of his illness. Wong had testified that he could not remember all the details about the trip, but he did remember two male Indians “talking about one packet of something…that’s the weed and then they want to push the blame to the other guy”.

</div> There was a doubt as to whether the officers sitting in the front of the van would have been able to hear Ashvin and Arun who were seated behind a partition. There were two seats at the back of the van but the escorting officers allegedly did not sit on those seats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I note at the outset that it was not established that Wong’s history of memory impairment had affected his ability to recall the events. I saw no reason to reject his evidence on this basis alone. Kannan’s evidence about what Wong had told him was not a pure afterthought, since Wong’s oral testimony about having heard Ashvin and Arun talking to each other to “push the blame” was consistent with what Kannan had said he was told by Wong. That said, although I did not think that Wong was an interested witness or had any reason to lie, I had serious reservations about the reliability of his evidence. In all likelihood, he was mistaken on various aspects and had resorted to speculation and conjecture. To begin with, he conceded that he had <span class="font-italic">assumed</span>, after discussing with Kannan about their cases, that the two Indian males in the van must have been talking about pushing the blame to Kannan, even though no names were specifically mentioned. It was also likely that he was mistaken or confused about what he had heard in the van, if indeed any conversation had taken place at all. Having carefully considered the totality of the evidence, I noted that Wong was roundly contradicted by the CNB officers and also found that his evidence was inherently incredible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In relation to the alleged conversation in the van, I agreed with the Prosecution that even if there had been a conversation, it would have been difficult for someone such as Wong who had no knowledge of the context of the case to link the conversation to Kannan specifically. In discussing their cases, Wong and Kannan appeared to have devised their own theory that Kannan was the person to whom Ashvin and Arun would purportedly “push the blame”. Wong had testified however that he did not know any actual details and had stated all he could remember when the Prosecution asked him to provide further details.

This inevitably led to Kannan forming his own impressions as well. It could well have meant that both Ashvin and Arun felt, not unjustifiably, that Kannan ought to be blamed principally for his actions which led to all of them being arrested. It did not necessarily reflect a conspiracy to frame Kannan and fabricate evidence against him. Ashvin and Arun did not seek to absolve themselves of any blame and they had accepted responsibility for their roles in the enterprise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 A striking indicator that Wong was an unreliable witness, though not necessarily an untruthful one, was his remarkable insistence under cross-examination that he would “never” have been mistaken in recalling events that might not have taken place.

</div> While it was undoubtedly possible that Ashvin and Arun did have opportunities to speak to each other, this fell far short of constituting cogent evidence of any conspiracy.

There was nothing to suggest that there was any expectation of being given their lives back in return as an “alm” in exchange for their cooperation, which was self-initiated. The offer of reduced non-capital charges for Ashvin and Arun only came much later, some three years down the line. Crucially, Kannan had blithely sidestepped mentioning the fact that he was extended a similar offer in spite of his denial of involvement. These offers had nothing to do with any suggested reciprocity or quid pro quo. At any rate, there was no special advantage that Ashvin and Arun had obtained that Kannan was potentially deprived of. Hence the argument that the Prosecution had given them back their lives as “alms” is specious and flies in the face of logic. Kannan’s life would similarly have been “spared” as well if he had decided to accept the offer extended to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The Defence further submitted that Vinod had a reason to falsely implicate Kannan in respect of Exhibit E1 as Ashvin and Vinod were friends.

Moreover, there was absolutely no evidence that any “conspiracy” had resulted in anyone securing a plea offer which otherwise would not have been extended to them.

</div> The Prosecution submitted that it was illogical for Arun to have to use Kannan’s phone on account of its auto-roaming function, since Arun’s phone was installed with the WhatsApp application which he could have used to make overseas calls. Further, considering the frequency at which Ashvin and Arun were using their phones at the material time, Dilip could have contacted them without Kannan’s assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The Prosecution also referred to other messages sent by Kannan right after he became aware that Arun had successfully collected the drugs and was about to deliver them to the Unit. Kannan had sent messages to four contacts, “Ruben Michael”, “David Sak”, “Ismail Buddy” and “Vik Meesai” on 2 June 2016 at about 11.46pm or 11.47pm, stating “Bro it’s in hand” and “Confirm how much you need can take anytime now”.

</div> However, SSI Ismail was not an expert on soccer betting and had testified with the intent to bolster the Prosecution’s case that the messages could relate to drugs. Kannan in turn denied that these four contacts were his potential clients for the sale of drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 From my reading of the WhatsApp messages, while being fully mindful that such messages can be abbreviated, ambiguous and liable to be read out of context, the irresistible inference was that these messages related to drug deals and not illegal soccer betting or 4D. The various messages Kannan had sent to these contacts gave rise in the circumstances to the compelling inference that Kannan was a drug trafficker. He was informing them that the drugs were “in hand” shortly after Arun had collected the brown bag from beside the electrical box in an open field beside Block 256 Punggol Way, in accordance with Kannan’s instructions. He was asking his clients, which included one “Ruben Michael”, to confirm how much drugs they needed, and they could “take anytime now”. Ruben Michael’s message in turn made it abundantly clear that he was disgruntled over Kannan’s unreliable timing with regard to the availability of the drugs he had ordered. The messages could not by any stretch of the imagination possibly be read as being about illegal betting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Kannan had called Oscar as a Defence witness and it would be fair to accept that based on the evidence, Kannan did gamble and was a punter, and had also accepted illegal bets from others. However, his defence was highly contrived, and Oscar’s evidence did not aid his case. The meanings he sought to attribute to the WhatsApp messages were inordinately strained. His self-serving explanations relied on a highly unnatural and esoteric reading of the text messages. Understood in context, the messages instead suggested quite emphatically that he was a drug trafficker and showed that the drugs in question were meant for trafficking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 A critical WhatsApp message was the one stating the postal code “822261” and “opposite the big field” as it clearly related to the drugs which were the subject matter of the charge. It was received by Kannan and sent contemporaneously by Kannan to Arun. This message contained a very specific reference to the Punggol Way collection point for the drugs in question. The Defence’s contention that the postal code was being forwarded from Dilip to Kannan to pass on to Arun was unbelievable. If it was true that Dilip was involved, there was simply no good reason why Dilip could not have contacted Ashvin or Arun directly. Indeed, this message containing the postal code and the location as well as the timing of the message corroborated the evidence of Ashvin and Arun, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Arun was instructed by Kannan to collect the drugs. Even if Dilip was not a fictitious person, Kannan was grasping at straws in a desperate effort to find some connection, however tenuous, to explain away his messages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In relation to Dilip, Kannan claimed in his defence that he had informed SSI Ismail about Dilip four years ago and had given him Dilip’s name. However, SSI Ismail “did not investigate properly”, such that he was now at trial and “facing this problem”.

</div> The Prosecution also relied on other messages, such as one sent from Kannan to Arun on 1 June, wherein he stated “All patients relying on you”. The Prosecution suggested to Kannan that this message related to customers who would be placing orders for cannabis with Kannan. Kannan testified that this was a typographical error and should have read as “all <span class="font-italic">punters </span>relying on you”.

</div> This was plainly a desperate and unconvincing attempt to attribute these communications to matters relating to collection of gambling moneys. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Having accepted the version of events given by Ashvin and Arun, at least some of the communications between Arun and Kannan on 2 June had to be in relation to the collection of the drugs, in particular the message stating “822261 opposite the big field” which specifically related to the location that Kannan had directed Arun to. Even if any of the communication records between Kannan and Arun were gambling-related, none of these would detract from the evidence adduced in Arun’s statements and Ashvin’s evidence, which clearly implicated Kannan in the trafficking of the drugs in question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Demeanour and credibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I turn next to make some brief observations pertaining to the Defence’s submission that Kannan was a truthful and credible witness based on his demeanour. The defence submitted that Kannan was not evasive and his testimony was consistent with the statements he gave to the CNB in all material particulars. It was submitted that he was candid and forthright in his testimony, and had been consistent in denying any involvement with the drugs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 A witness may project unflappable confidence and seemingly disarming candour while unflinchingly maintaining an account that appears to be largely consistent. Even so, he is not necessarily a truthful and credible witness on account of his demeanour and presentation alone. His testimony must be tested for plausibility and evaluated for internal and external consistencies. In the present case, given the cogency of the incriminating evidence from his co-conspirators as well as the cumulative weight of the objective evidence, Kannan’s resolute disavowal of involvement and myriad allegations of false incrimination were wholly implausible. Moreover, as noted above, his evidence was shifting, inconsistent and unreliable. He was clearly tailoring his defence to suit his needs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 On my evaluation of Kannan’s defence, his testimony was dubious, given the near-forensic specificity with which he sought to link up the various events to the timings and contents of the various messages and phone calls. It was highly unlikely that he would be able to remember minutiae and timing details with so much clarity four years later. This strongly suggested that he had done so <span class="font-italic">post hoc</span> in order to shore up his claims. The inescapable inference was that he had contrived to make up a story to exculpate himself. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evidence of conspiracy </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In my assessment, the Prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that there was a conspiracy involving Kannan, Arun and Ashvin to traffic in the drugs. Having considered the evidence adduced in the round, I found that all three of them had agreed to participate in the conspiracy to engage in the unlawful activity. They were fully aware of the general purpose of the common design. The <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> for abetment by conspiracy as outlined in <span class="font-italic">Bahashwan</span> at [34] was thus established.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I accepted that it was possible that Ashvin only joined in the conspiracy when Arun returned with the drugs and placed them in the bedroom of the Unit. Arguably, Ashvin might not have agreed at the earlier point when all three of them were in the bedroom, since he then went downstairs and locked the grilles in a feeble attempt to distance himself from the scheme. But he continued to stay in the area and remained contactable, and ultimately returned to the bedroom where the drugs were kept and remained inside the bedroom. Ashvin himself had pleaded guilty to a reduced charge on the same factual background and accepted that he was involved in the conspiracy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 As for the Defence’s argument that Ashvin did not testify about any express agreement with Arun whereby Arun would collect the drugs and traffic it to Ashvin, this was misconceived. Having accepted the testimonies of Ashvin and Arun, I found it patently clear that both of them were aware of the plan as discussed in Ashvin’s bedroom. Kannan orchestrated all arrangements. He gave instructions for collection and safekeeping of the drugs. Pursuant to the conspiracy, Arun collected the drugs on Kannan’s instructions in order to pass them to Ashvin to be kept in the Unit. This handover which constituted the act of trafficking was eventually carried out and Ashvin had, together with Arun, personally placed the drugs in his room. An agreement to be part of this plan could be readily inferred from the actions of Ashvin and Arun. As the Prosecution rightly submitted, the sheer quantity of drugs and the transaction involving Exhibit E1 made it clear beyond reasonable doubt that Kannan had intended to traffic in the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Counsel had demonstrated appreciable diligence and their considerable endeavours to assist Kannan in mounting his defence were commendable. Nevertheless, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all the elements of the charge had been proven. The overall picture that emerged was one of Kannan attempting to push the blame to everyone else, when he was in fact the mastermind in respect of the collection and trafficking of the drugs through Arun’s delivery of the drugs to Ashvin. Kannan himself had intended to traffic the drugs but he had schemed to exculpate himself from the time of the offence and after his arrest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Accordingly, I found Kannan guilty as charged and sentenced him to the mandatory punishment of death.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lau Wing Yum, Kenneth Kee and Kevin Ho (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ram Goswami (Ram Goswami) and Wong Li-Yen Dew (Dew Chambers) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
