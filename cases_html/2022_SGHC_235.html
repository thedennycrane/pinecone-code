The power to “recall and re-examine” witnesses indicates that the provision concerns the trial court making the finding of facts.

</div> CM 30 was therefore fundamentally flawed as a matter of procedure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Even if the applicant had first made the present s 283 application to the DJ and the DJ had refused to summon the Witness, there could still be no appeal against that ruling made in the course of a trial. In <span class="font-italic">Xu Yuanchen</span>, Menon CJ summarised the position with regard to appeals in interlocutory matters in these terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10 Generally, directions and orders given on interlocutory matters are not appealable. This broad prohibition was stated in our jurisprudence by Sir Alan Rose CJ in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Hoo Chang Chwen</span> [1962] MLJ 284, who considered that appeals against interlocutory rulings would stifle the course of criminal trials ‘on points which are in their essence procedural’, and that the proper time to take those points would be upon appeal ‘after determination of the principal matter in the trial court’. After all, in the course of a typical trial, the trial judge can be expected to make numerous interlocutory rulings and it would pose impossible difficulties for the expeditious conduct of the trial if each and every one of these could be appealed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 This is also an expression of the law’s concern with curbing unreasonably litigious behaviour. In the criminal context, this is a serious concern, not just as a matter of practical policy but as a matter of justice as well. As Choo Han Teck J has observed, frequent interruptions of a trial disrupt ‘the flow and dignity of a trial’ and ‘[tarnish] the image of the rule of law’: <span class="font-italic">Yap Keng Ho v Public Prosecutor</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 259 (‘<span class="font-italic">Yap Keng Ho</span>’) at [7]. In a similar vein, Chan Sek Keong CJ cautioned against ‘disrupted and fractured criminal trials’ which create ‘unacceptable delays in their final disposal’: <span class="font-italic">Azman bin Jamaludin v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 1 SLR 615 (‘<span class="font-italic">Azman</span>’) at [44].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 Moreover, it is difficult to justify appellate intervention in ‘inchoate circumstances’ where there is little basis for a judge to evaluate what the nature and extent of any alleged injustice is: <span class="font-italic">Yap Keng Ho</span> at [6]. If there are any errors, those may be corrected on appeal: <span class="font-italic">Azman</span> at [44] and [51]. Barring something ‘imminently fatal to the applicant’s case’ (<span class="font-italic">Yap Keng Ho</span> at [6]), the law does not countenance such premature applications in the middle of trial. In short, such appeals are not absolutely barred though they must clear a high hurdle before they will be entertained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 If the applicant makes the s 283 application to the DJ and the DJ does not grant it and eventually convicts the applicant, it is open to the applicant to challenge the correctness of that ruling in an appeal against conviction. If the High Court on appeal holds that the DJ was wrong to have refused to summon the Witness, the High Court will then make the appropriate orders based on the justice of the entire case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In similar vein, the High Court will not exercise its revisionary jurisdiction over a State Court’s procedural rulings in the course of ongoing proceedings. This principle prevents the same mischief that would arise in appeals against interlocutory rulings. Menon CJ stated that a court hearing an application for revision should consider three factors (<span class="font-italic">Xu Yuanchen</span> at [16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, it should consider whether the application is in truth and in substance nothing more than an interlocutory appeal disguised as an attempt to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction in order to circumvent the general and presumptive prohibition against interlocutory appeals. Second, it should examine the nature of the relief sought and consider whether the application implicates the sort of mischief that the prohibition against interlocutory appeals was designed to avoid. Applications pertaining to bail or the seizure of property may be less directly connected with the continuing conduct of a trial, as compared to an application for discovery of documents (as in the applications before me) or to admit or exclude evidence or to permit lines of cross-examination. The former may not always disrupt or interfere with the proper conduct of the trial whereas the latter almost invariably will. Further, the former may not always concern matters that can appropriately be taken up in the substantive appeal whereas the latter almost always will. Third, the court should remind itself that the revisionary jurisdiction is concerned with errors that are so serious as to give rise to grave and serious injustice that strikes at the relevant act as an exercise of judicial power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 <span class="font-italic">Ng Chye Huey and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 106 also cautions against revisionary intervention at the interlocutory stage.

</div> There, the applicant filed a criminal motion to the Court of Appeal seeking an order directing the trial judge in the then Subordinate Courts to make a number of orders to facilitate the adduction of some United Nations reports in evidence (at [1]). The motion was dismissed as the Court of Appeal held that it lacked the power to exercise revisionary or supervisory jurisdiction over the Subordinate Courts (at [63]). The court added that “[i]f issues such as the present were taken up through <span class="font-italic">separate</span> proceedings at <span class="font-italic">any</span> and <span class="font-italic">every</span> opportunity (or at the whim of the party concerned or even occasionally), the conduct of a criminal trial would be seriously impeded and delayed” [emphasis in original in italics] (at [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It is also difficult to justify appellate or revisionary intervention in interlocutory matters because “in ‘inchoate circumstances’ ... there is little basis for a judge to evaluate what the nature and extent of any alleged injustice is” (<span class="font-italic">Xu Yuanchen</span> at [12], citing <span class="font-italic">Yap Keng Ho v Public Prosecutor</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 259 at [6]).

The High Court is not the court which is hearing the evidence and which has to make the decision in the ongoing trial based on the totality of the evidence. Asking it to undertake the assessment under s 283 therefore places it in an invidious position. For these reasons, even if the DJ conducting the Trial had heard and dismissed a s 283 application, the High Court would not exercise its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction to grant CM 30 while the Trial is ongoing. The DJ might eventually decide to acquit the applicant because the charges against him were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, in which case there would be no need to adduce evidence from the Witness at all. However, should the DJ convict the applicant, the applicant may appeal against conviction and seek to persuade the High Court that the Witness’ evidence was necessary and that his absence has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Prosecution asked for costs of $2,000 to be paid by the applicant on the ground that CM 30 was frivolous and has resulted in a delay in the progress of the Trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The applicant’s counsel claimed that he had misunderstood the import of s 283 CPC. In any case, he argued that costs should be limited to $1,000 because the Prosecution was not called upon to reply orally and the hearing before me lasted for about 30 minutes only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Section 409 CPC sets out the court’s power to impose costs if a criminal motion is dismissed: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">409.</span>  If the relevant court dismisses a criminal motion and is of the opinion that the motion was frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the relevant court, it may, either on the application of the respondent or on its own motion, order the applicant of the criminal motion to pay to the respondent costs on an indemnity basis or otherwise fixed by the relevant court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my judgment, CM 30 was frivolous and was bound to fail. It is clear from a proper reading of s 283 CPC that the power relating to witnesses is for the court hearing the substantive matter to which the evidence relates to exercise. The power is not meant for a superior court exercising appellate or revisionary jurisdiction. No application was made to the DJ based on the asserted change in circumstances in this case but, as explained earlier, even if the DJ had heard and dismissed a s 283 application in the course of the ongoing Trial, it is clear that the High Court would not exercise its appellate or its revisionary jurisdiction to intervene in interlocutory matters such as the admission or rejection of evidence while the Trial is ongoing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Accordingly, I dismissed CM 30 and ordered the applicant to pay the Prosecution costs of $2,000.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Phipps Jonathan (LegalStandard LLP) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kevin Yong and Tan Zhi Hao (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
