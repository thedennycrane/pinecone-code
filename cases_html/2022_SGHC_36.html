There have been previous instances of dispute and disagreement, with various attempts at reconciliation and mediation. In the present case, Mr Phua Kiah Mai (“the Plaintiff”), a member and director of the Company, established sufficient basis for the Company to be wound up, as he showed that the interests of the minority were being disregarded. However, the Plaintiff’s attempt to invoke an underlying basis or agreement between members that the Company was to serve as the financial arm of the Singapore Hainan Hwee Kuan (“the Society”), which the Plaintiff is President of, failed.

He argued that the substratum of the Company was to work jointly with the Society for the benefit of the Hainanese community in Singapore and provide financial support to the Society; and this had been lost as it ceased to so work with the Society. He submitted that there was a justifiable loss of confidence in the management of the company which provided grounds for winding up under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>), and that the Defendant’s directors had acted in the affairs of the Company in their own interests rather than in the interests of the members as a whole, or in any other manner apparently unfair and unjust to other members pursuant to s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the CA. He alleged, amongst others, that there was a lack of probity, accountability and transparency on the part of those directors. It was also alleged that they had conducted the affairs of the Company to the exclusion of the Plaintiff and certain other directors of the Company, in a manner that was not in the interests of the members of the Company as a whole. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the Defendant’s Case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Defendant argued that there was no such substratum as alleged by the Plaintiff. It argued that the Plaintiff had raised trivial matters in support of his allegation of a justifiable loss of confidence in the management of the Company. It was submitted that the Plaintiff’s claimed breaches of statutory and constitutional requirements on the part of the Company were not connected to unfairness justifying a winding up; and that these were also caused by an impasse over the implementation of the Consent Order, for which the Plaintiff was responsible as well. Furthermore, the Plaintiff’s allegations did not show that certain directors had acted against the interests of the members of the Company. For example, its decision not to fund the Society, which was not a member of the Company, was made in the interests of its members. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 While I was not persuaded that the Plaintiff made out a case for just and equitable winding up on the basis of any relationship between the Society and the Company, I did find that there was unfairness in the conduct of the affairs of the Company justifying winding-up being ordered under either s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CA.

In <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi</span>, Lord Wilberforce noted that the superimposition of equitable considerations which may give rise to a winding up under this ground typically includes one or more of the following elements (at 379):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) An association formed or continued on the basis of a personal relationship of mutual confidence;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) An agreement or understanding that all or some of the shareholders shall participate in the conduct of the business; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Restriction on the transfer of the members’ interests in the company, such that if confidence is lost or one member is removed from management, he cannot take out his stake and go elsewhere.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In line with Lord Wilberforce’s observation that “it is these, and analogous, factors” which may bring the “just and equitable” jurisdiction into play, the Courts have not limited their jurisdiction to superimpose equitable considerations in merely these three circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim </span>at [30]). It has been observed that the various categories of cases involving winding-up on just and equitable grounds include (Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at paras 5.037–5.069; see also <span class="font-italic">Chow Kwok Chuen v Chow Kwok Chi and another </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 362 at [18], citing <span class="font-italic">Wa</span><span class="font-italic">lter Woon on Company Law </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 3rd Ed, 2005) (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) at paras 17.54–17.74):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Oppressive conduct, such as the exclusion of a member from management participation contrary to an understanding that he will be allowed to so participate; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) An irretrievable breakdown in relationship amongst the shareholders; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Loss of substratum, where the main or primary object of the company can no longer be achieved; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Where a company was formed with a fraudulent purpose.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The breach of a general understanding or common intention as to the type and limits of a corporate venture gives rise to a loss of substratum or basis, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the main object which the company was formed to achieve (<span class="font-italic">Ma Wai Fong Kathryn v Trillion Investment Pte Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 1046 (“<span class="font-italic">Kathryn Ma</span>”) at [63]; citing <span class="font-italic">Re Goodwealth Trading Pte Ltd </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 691 at [25]). In such cases, the unfairness lies in holding the parties to the association despite the loss of substratum (<span class="font-italic">Ka</span><span class="font-italic">thryn Ma </span>at [63]).  In particular, it is noted that in some of the local cases, such as <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim</span>, the notion of legitimate expectations was used to consider the extent and nature of that shared understanding (at [40]–[45]). This followed from its use in English cases including <span class="font-italic">Re Astec (BSR) plc</span> [1998] 2 BCLC 556, which was approved by Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill and another v Phillips and others </span>[1999] 1 WLR 1092 (“<span class="font-italic">O’Neill</span>”) at 1101. Although the latter were cases concerning unfair prejudice under s 459 of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK) (corresponding to s 216 of the CA), the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim </span>noted that the jurisdiction under ss 216 and 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CA, although distinct, do overlap in many situations, being both predicated on the concept of unfairness (<span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim </span>at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Lastly, it is noted that the cases in this area generally proceed on the basis of unfairness in the context of a “quasi-partnership”, which may include one or more of the elements noted in <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi </span>(as noted at [13] above; <span class="font-italic">Seah Chee Wan and another v Connectus Group Pte Ltd </span>[2019] SGHC 228 (“<span class="font-italic">Seah </span><span class="font-italic">Chee Wan</span>”) at [115]–[116]). It must then be shown why keeping the company as a going concern would result in unfairness (<span class="font-italic">Seah Chee Wan </span>at [117]). In this context, the term “quasi-partnership” is simply a shorthand label which is intended to reflect those factors which bring into play the equitable principles borrowed from the law of partnership (Robin Hollington QC, <span class="font-italic">Hollington on Shareholder’s Rights </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2020) at para 7.40). The underlying question is whether the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the affairs of a company are such as to give rise to equitable constraints on the behaviour of other members, going beyond the strict rights and obligations in statute and the constitutional documents (<span class="font-italic">Fisher v Cadman </span>[2006] 1 BCLC 499 (“<span class="font-italic">Fisher</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [84]). Ultimately, even where the statutory grounds for winding up a company have been technically established, the Court has a residual discretion to consider whether, having regard to all relevant factors including the utility and effect of the winding up order and the overall fairness and justice of the case, the company concerned should be wound up (<span class="font-italic">Lai Shit Har and another v Lau Yu Man </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 348 at [33]; <span class="font-italic">Perennial </span>at [82]; <span class="font-italic">Foo Peow Yong Douglas v E</span><span class="font-italic">RC Prime II Pte Ltd and another appeal and other matters </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1337 (“<span class="font-italic">Douglas Foo</span>”) at [59]).   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Plaintiff invoked a loss of substratum on the basis of an alleged historical and social connection and relationship between the Company and the Society.

</div> On the Plaintiff’s conception, the Company was intended to serve the needs of the Society. Its primary obligation was to fund the latter’s administrative expenses and the costs of its activities, such as scholarships disbursed by the Society. The inextricable relationship between the two organisations was evidenced by the fact that they jointly used the Kheng Chiu Building (“the Building”).

</div> Although the Building was legally owned by the Company, up till 2019, the Company allowed the Society to use it rent-free.  They also shared a joint secretariat and jointly managed the Kheng Chiu Loke Tin Kee Home (“the Home”), which was established by the Hainanese community as a joint endeavour by the Company and the Society.

According to the Plaintiff, the Temple was initially set up by the Society Predecessor and manged by it. The Company Predecessor was then set up as a separate unregistered society in the name of the Temple, to take over from the Society Predecessor the administration of the assets of the Hainanese community, allegedly to avoid confiscation of the assets it held. This was as the colonial government in the 1930s had taken a hard-line stance against societies, and the Society Predecessor as a registered society was subject to greater scrutiny and control, such as being required to declare its real estate and cash flow statements.

It submitted that this was also not borne out by the Mediation Agreement, which provided that the Company’s assets were held for the purposes of the community (as opposed to the Society); and its provisions that the Company was to pay certain regular sums to the Society was a “far cry” from recognising that the Company’s primary object was to fund the Society’s expenses.

However, neither Mr CF Foo nor Mr Lim were before the Court to testify as to such a belief held by them. Another member at the former meeting had also objected as to Mr Tan’s characterisation of the history of the Company and the Society, and asserted that there had been no such transfer of properties, which were acquired in the name of the Company Predecessor to begin with. When presented in cross-examination with what that other member had stated, the Plaintiff agreed that “different members would have different interpretation of history”.

Neither the Mediation Agreement nor the Consent Order between the Society and the Company fulfilled this role, as compromises may be entered into for a variety of reasons, without full acceptance of the version of events put forward by the other side. The fact that no formalisation was done over many decades gave rise to considerable doubt that the alleged substratum really existed. Here, the Company was shown, to my mind, to have other possible functions beyond financial support for the Society.

</div> Accordingly, the fact that the Company had provided funding to the Society over the years could not itself be a basis for the substratum. That would, if at all, be an argument in estoppel or some similar doctrine, being a matter to be raised in a direct claim by the Society against the Company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) The members of the Company did not have an understanding as alleged by the Plaintiff</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Fifth, the members of the Company were also not proven to have had such an understanding of the organisations being “two-in-one”. The difference of views between the members within the Company were obvious, and if anything, most of the members as indicated by the views of the majority of the Board seemed to be content to have a different kind of relationship than what was claimed by the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The case law does show that it is possible for a relationship between members of a company giving rise to equitable considerations to occur before or after incorporation (<span class="font-italic">Michel v Michel and others </span>[2020] 1 BCLC 54 at [83]). In <span class="font-italic">Lim Ah Sia v Tiong Tuang Yeong and others </span>[2014] 4 SLR 140, the Court recognised that a quasi-partnership could arise in respect of subsequent agreements after incorporation. This could take place, for example, when the “original objects and purposes for which the [c]ompany was incorporated had disappeared”, and the remaining shareholders decided to carry on the business based on new understandings and agreements in response to the “radically changed circumstances”, which were not formalised due to the existing mutual trust and confidence between shareholders (at [70]). However, what I see from the cases is that there must be clear evidence of such a new understanding or new agreement being formed (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Strahan v Wilcox </span>[2006] 2 BCLC 555 at [23] and [25]; <span class="font-italic">Shepherd v Williamson and another </span>[2010] EWHC 2375 (Ch) at [81]–[89]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As for a quasi-partnership, understanding or other substratum lasting beyond the original members, I do note that there are cases in which it has been found that a mutual understanding giving rise to equitable considerations between members in a company may also endure and bind successors. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Khoshkhou v Cooper and others </span>[2014] EWHC 1087 (Ch), David Cooke J held that the entry of a new member and director into the company did not affect its continued characterisation as a quasi-partnership which was closely dependent on the involvement of some or all of its shareholders, and the personal relationship between the four original members (at [25]). It was not disputed that the new member had joined due to his friendly relations with one of the directors, and intended to play a full part in the management and operations of the company. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Fisher</span>, Mr Phillip Sales (sitting as a Deputy Judge of the English High Court) held that where a father had run a business as an informal family company, his death and that of his spouse, and the devolution of their shares to their children did not affect its quasi-partnership nature (at [89]). In <span class="font-italic">Re Edwardian Group Ltd </span>[2019] 1 BCLC 171, Fancourt J regarded the situation in <span class="font-italic">Fisher </span>as one where the shareholders who were not parties to the equitable considerations were closely connected to the quasi-partners, such that the established quasi-partnership character of the company did not change (at [134]). He considered that such equitable considerations arising from an agreement or understanding between members were (at [135]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… enforceable in equity because of its mutuality: the mutual relationship of trust and confidence, of a personal character, affects the conscience of each member equally. Almost by definition, if the majority (by voting rights) of the members are not bound by any such mutual rights or understanding, the company does not have the characteristics of a partnership. One can see that, in an exceptional case, the fact that a small shareholding may have devolved on someone ‘outside the ring’ ought not to affect the character of the company. In other cases, the shares may only be permitted to be transferred to someone who is a member of the class within the ring, so that the character of the company is unaffected. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Again, for such understanding to endure and enure to successors, there must be clear evidence of its intended durability. As has been examined here, what was put forward fell far short. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Furthermore, the great difficulty with the Plaintiff’s assertion of a substratum was that, even beyond the constitutional documents of the Company, the members of the Company were not shown to have a general understanding and common intention as to such an alleged main object (<span class="font-italic">Re Johnson Corp Ltd </span>(1980) 5 ACLR 227 at 235; <span class="font-italic">Strong v J Brough &amp; Son (Strathfield) Pty Ltd </span>(1991) 5 ACSR 296 at 300; <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim </span>at [14]).

</div> This suggested that there were previously already disagreements over the Company’s purported obligations to fund the Society and provide it rent-free use of the Building. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(F) It was not shown that the agreement involved all the members</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Sixth, another difficulty with the Plaintiff’s argument was that where the alleged agreement affected the general activities of the Company, one would have expected the agreement to involve all the members. Anything less would lead to the result that the other members who were strangers to the alleged arrangement would be bound as well. Yet, there was no mechanism for this, nor did the Plaintiff adduce any such evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(G) It was not shown that the Society represented all Hainanese persons</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Finally, it was also no answer for the Plaintiff to have pointed to the supposed expectations or objectives of the Hainanese community. There was no evidence that the Society did in fact represent all Hainanese, or had some legal capacity to represent them. The aspirations of the Society, its leadership and its members over the years did not count. In the absence of evidence of the involvement of all or substantially the whole of the Hainanese population in the affairs of the Society, and acceptance by them of the Society’s claimed position, the Plaintiff’s assertions could not be accepted. The conferment of some representative power on the Society by statute would have been an alternative basis, but there was no such statutory framework in place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 All of this left aside the important question of who counted as Hainanese – which the Court did not have to go into on this occasion.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Even if the alleged substratum existed, it was not so limited as to justify a winding up </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I was of the view that even if the purported main object of the Company as argued by the Plaintiff was made out, the substratum of the Company was not so limited as to justify a winding up. This is as a company will not be wound up on the “just and equitable” ground simply on the basis that a prominent purpose for the company is incapable of being achieved, if other objects of the company are still capable being achieved (<span class="font-italic">Re Perfectair Holdings Ltd </span>(1989) 5 BCC 837 (“<span class="font-italic">Perfectair Holdings</span>”) at 848). The level of unfairness in cases concerning a loss of substratum was thus described in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill </span>as (at 1101–1102):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… there may be some event which puts an end to the basis upon which the parties entered into association with each other, making it unfair that one shareholder should insist upon the continuance of the association. The analogy of contractual frustration suggests itself. The unfairness may arise not from what the parties have positively agreed but from a majority using its legal powers to maintain the association in circumstances to which the minority can reasonably say it did not agree: non haec in foedera veni. It is well recognised that in such a case there would be power to wind up the company on the just and equitable ground … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As such, in <span class="font-italic">Ho Po Yeng v Ho Ming Chun</span> [2013] HKEC 378, Harris J in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance rejected the petitioner’s argument that there was an understanding between the founding members of the subject company that its business would be machinery maintenance and the manufacture of plastic injection moulding, and that the company would be wound up in the event that this ceased to continue. Applying <span class="font-italic">Perfectair Holdings</span>, Harris J observed that the objects clause of the subject company was drafted in wide terms: although manufacturing and dealing in plant and machinery was the first of the commercial activities listed as the principal purposes of the company, it was merely the most prominent amongst many. The clause also expressly included carrying on business as property owners, and the company had been letting out rental properties for income for 12 years prior to the petition for winding up. The argument as to a loss of substratum was therefore not made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the present case, it was clear from the M&amp;A of the Company (as noted at [33] above) that the Company had numerous other objects. These included the administration of the Temple and burial grounds, and the support of welfare and charitable associations or projects in Singapore or elsewhere. It was similarly understood by its members that the Company financially supported other associations and projects, in particular the Home – although, as will be discussed below, it was not clear that a proper procedure was followed in relation some of those payments.

</div> I was therefore of the opinion that even assuming that a principal object of the Company was to financially support the Society and provide it rent-free use of the Building, the failure of the Company to do so did not in itself justify winding up on the just and equitable ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For completeness, to address the purported failure of the Company’s main object as alleged by the Plaintiff, there was evidence showing that the Company did not furnish the Society with the funding it requested for in relation to certain activities, even though the Society had sought to clarify the Company’s questions on them, and the Company did not appear to raise further concerns.

</div> As for the alleged exclusion of the Society from the Building, the Plaintiff’s complaint was four-fold, namely: (a) the Society was prevented from using the auditorium in the Building for its Chinese New Year celebrations on 8 February 2019 as well as its weekly education and cultural classes; (b) the Society was prevented from using a meeting room in the Building, with no explanation given to it; (c) the documents and records of the Society were removed from the joint secretariat office in the Building; and (d) the signboard on the façade of the Building which stated “Hainan Hwee Kuan” was replaced with one stating “Kheng Chiu Building”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I found that the purported exclusion of the Society from the auditorium was plausibly on account of security and safety concerns: minutes from an informal meeting of the Board of Directors on 30 July 2019 recorded that some persons had damaged the auditorium, resulting in its closure.

Furthermore, on the removal of the documents and records of the Society from the joint secretariat, although the evidence was not clear on which party initiated the removal, this appeared to be a natural corollary of the fact that the Society was stopped from using the facilities in the Building.

</div> The matters relied on by the Plaintiff as going towards a loss of substratum would therefore have been made out only in part, on the assumption that there was indeed such a substratum as alleged – which was not the case, as discussed above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on just and equitable ground</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In sum, I found that none of the evidence relied upon by the Plaintiff sufficiently showed that the members of the Company recognised any relationship of the sort he asserted, as between the Company and the Society. The previous provision by the Company of funding or support could just as easily have been a temporary arrangement, lacking any intention or objective of being long-lasting. All that the Plaintiff relied upon was equivocal, and could have been explained on other grounds. In any event, the existence of other objects of the Company which continued to be relevant meant that winding up could not be justified on the basis of any loss of the alleged substratum.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unfairness ground </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As regards this ground, a number of allegations were made by the Plaintiff, not all of which, I found, were made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Section 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the CA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Circumstances in which company may be wound up by Court</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">254.</span>— (1)  The Court may order the winding up if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) the directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than in the interests of the members as a whole, or in any other manner whatever which appears to be unfair or unjust to other members. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Under the first limb of the subsection, “the directors” does not require the Board to act unanimously; it is sufficient if the effective majority has acted in their own interests or the interests of one or more of those Board members, or even where one director has “caused his will to be carried into effect … with the result that his personal interest has been preferred” (<span class="font-italic">Re Cumberland Holdings Ltd </span>(1976) 1 ACLR 361 (“<span class="font-italic">Cumberland Holdings</span>”) at 374). Furthermore, the “affairs of the company” is a wide description encompassing all matters which may come before the Board for consideration (<span class="font-italic">Cumberland Holdings </span>at 374–375). What is targeted is the directors preferring their own interests to one or more or some significant section of the members, and thus cannot be said to be acting in the interests of the members as a whole (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">HL Sensecurity Pte Ltd (formerly known as HL Integral Systems Pte Ltd) </span>[2006] SGHC 135 (“<span class="font-italic">HL Sensecurity</span>”) at [28]).

As such, I do not propose to distinguish them in this aspect.

He argued that there was a failure to convene general meetings, present and file financial statements, and file annual returns. These contravened the requirements under statute. Board meetings had also not been held since 2015. The Plaintiff further contended that there was unfair conduct arising out of the aforementioned alleged exclusion of the Society from the Building including the replacement of the signboard stating “Hainan Hwee Kuan” on the Building, and a failure to implement the Consent Order. The Defendant responded that the Plaintiff was aware that an impasse in the implementation of the Consent Order, for which he was partly responsible, meant that the Company was unable to comply with certain statutory and constitutional requirements.

These were by Mr Foo’s admission informal meetings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not actual Board meetings.

Proper procedure as laid down in statute and the constitutional documents of the company ought to be followed: that is the trade-off between the benefits of incorporation, such as limited liability and separate legal personality, as against the obligations to ensure proper management and the balancing of interests of the members. The lack of proper management decision-making through the failure to appropriately convene Board meetings was really a usurpation of the proper decision-making process by a faction within the Company, and could not be tolerated even if that faction constituted the majority. The ability to consider, to voice opinions before deliberation, and if necessary, call for a vote, lies at the core of decision-making within a corporate entity.

Furthermore, the relevant financial statements were not sent together with the circular resolutions, and the Company did not respond to three letters sent by Mr Cheng requesting for the statements as well as that a Board meeting be held to discuss them.

</div> In general, I found that these financial matters were not properly deliberated and considered: although the passing of resolutions by circulation can sometimes allow for discussion and debate, what occurred in the present case, with individuals turning up to be shown the documents, and for them to sign without anything more, fell far short of the engagement and scrutiny required.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Company argued that as statutory consequences have been laid out for non-compliance, such non-compliance should not give rise to a winding up.

</div> However, while each infringement could give rise to culpability and possible punishment, these penalties did not in my view preclude such infringement from also being a basis for winding up. What mattered was the scale and extent of such breach; where these were wide-ranging, as in the present case, winding up may indeed be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Company also argued that the subject of some of the Plaintiff’s complaints, in particular the abovementioned letters sent by Mr Cheng to request for information, were not genuine. I found that even if Mr Cheng was acting for some other purpose, this did not rob his requests of their legitimate basis, and they should have been responded to. Even if these were only intended to harass, other avenues of redress should have been pursued by those running the Company, as opposed to ignoring the letters. The appropriate provision of information is also part and parcel of the proper management and control of a corporate entity. This would not by itself normally be an indication of unfairness, as various reasons could have lain behind the non-response. But taken together with the lapses surrounding the holding of meetings and the failure to properly discuss financial documents, the non-response took on a different hue: it indicated a blatant disregard for the interests of others, especially those not part of the majority.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I thus found that the Company’s various arguments did not support its defence in respect of this ground.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on unfairness ground</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 From all of the above, I was satisfied that there was ample evidence to show that those in control of the Board of the Company preferred their own interests over those of the members as a whole, and that this was in a manner unfair or unjust to the other members. Under the CA, the Board is the decision making body within a company. Anything that circumvents the authority and proper functioning of the Board undercuts proper governance, and can only damage the company. Here, the holding of the informal meetings in place of proper Board meetings not only deprived the minority Board members of the opportunity at least to voice their positions and attempt to convince other Board members, but also by doing so denied the Company appropriate governance, as required under the law. Similarly, the truncated consideration of the financial matters circumvented the proper process for determining such issues. From this, I found that the controlling group within the Company was not exercising its powers for the benefit of the Company as a whole, and overrode and disregarded the interests of the minority group without justification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The two factual situations above also amounted to unfair or oppressive conduct giving rise to a justifiable loss of confidence in the management of the Company, such as would justify winding up pursuant to s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the CA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arguments that were not accepted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 While I found a number of matters against the Company and its management, the Plaintiff was not successful in all his arguments. In particular, the failure of the Company to fund the Society, the exclusion of the Society from the Building, the removal of the signboard and the failure to implement the Consent Order did not support the Plaintiff’s claims in relation to unfairness, insofar as it was open to the Company to have come to the conclusion that none of those things were in the Company’s interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For example, it would have been reasonable for the Company to have concluded after the fact that implementing the Consent Order in the manner sought or interpreted by the Society was not in the interests of its membership as a whole. Whether other consequences should follow from non-compliance was a separate matter. Additionally, the premise underlying all of the complaints was that there was a special relationship between the Company and the Society, and I found that this was either not made out or was irrelevant to the running of the Company. Indeed, the Plaintiff’s allegations concerning the Company’s funding of the Society as well as the exclusion of the Society from the Building and the removal of the signboard did not touch on the minority interests claimed by the Plaintiff in the activities of the Company, but really concerned the Society’s interests. However, the Society was not a member of the Company, and how its interests were affected was irrelevant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Society representing the Hainanese community </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I must note that while the Plaintiff claimed that the Society represented the interests of the Hainanese community, the Courts would be very slow to accept such an argument, unless the organisation in question has a clear basis for the assertion, together with an appropriate framework for consultation and deliberation by the community as a whole. The best indication of this would have been a statutory framework, but the Society was not a statutory organisation. Although the Rules of the Society provided that it was established to, <span class="font-italic">inter</span><span class="font-italic"> alia</span>, represent the Hainanese community in matters affecting their common interests and rights,

</div> such a belief, however strongly held by its members that it represented a community as whole would not be enough: no group is monolithic, or homogenous in its views. In the present case, the Society potentially represented no more than the views of its members for the time being, and would not then be representing the whole section of the public that was the Hainanese community. In any event, as argued by the Company, the Society was not a party to these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On that note, I also did not accept the argument by the Plaintiff that Mr Foo and his faction had “replaced” the Society with Hainan Federation, which was set up by Mr Foo and several others, and similarly purported to be “responsible for connecting [the] Hainan [c]ommunity and develop[ing] Hainanese culture”.

</div> The Plaintiff argued that the Hainan Federation had held its inauguration ceremony jointly with the Company’s anniversary celebration dinner, whereas the Society had previously held joint anniversary celebrations with the Company; furthermore, the Company’s secretariat carried out work for the Hainan Federation. However, there was no evidence showing that these were authorised by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Plaintiff submitted that as the Hainan Federation was open to other dialect groups (as opposed to the Society, which was only open to Hainanese), this was an instance of Mr Foo and his faction attempting to admit more of their supporters as members of the Company, in order to “establish a stronghold over the management of the [Company]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76  As noted above, I did not accept the existence of any such substratum as alleged by the Plaintiff, such that his argument on a loss of substratum could not succeed. In any event, insofar that the Company supported many other organisations in accordance with its objects (as mentioned at [45] above), the Company’s apparent support of the Hainan Federation could not have amounted to a loss of substratum. Additionally, although directors may be held to have acted in their own interests where they have acted in the interests of another company of which they are also directors and shareholders (<span class="font-italic">Cumberland Holdings </span>at 375), what was raised did not rise to the level of being contrary to commercial morality or integrity (see [51] above; <span class="font-italic">Re Weedmans Ltd </span>[1974] Qd R 377 at 397–398; <span class="font-italic">Cumberland Holdings </span>at 375–376). It was difficult to see how the holding of joint celebrations with Hainan Federation and the fact that the Company secretariat did work for the Hainan Federation was unfair and unjust to the members of the Company (as opposed to the Society).

It was not shown, for example, that members of the Hainan Federation would also be members of the Company, such that Mr Foo and his faction could enjoy wider support in the Company. Indeed, it seemed that the Hainan Federation was intended to cooperate with the Society, with the possibility of merger between the two raised by Mr Foo and confirmed by one Mr Ngiam Seng Wee, a member of both the Company and Society and the Secretary-General of the Hainan Federation.

Obligations were still owed to the members, who were entitled to expect to be treated fairly. As observed by the Plaintiff, non-profit driven organisations such as the Defendant which choose to incorporate themselves generally adopt the form of a company limited by guarantee rather than shares because “what is important is the participation of the members and not the raising of capital” (Jean Warburton, <span class="font-italic">Unincorporated Associations: Law and Practice </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 1992) at pp 6–7).

</div> Members may also simply leave if they wish to end their association with the company. It submitted that it was therefore unlikely that members of such companies could suffer unfairness from a loss of substratum. Furthermore, it submitted that an argument on a loss of confidence in the management of a company ought not apply in this context, since there was no “minority” shareholder to speak of and similarly, any members who wished to leave could do so without any issue of being locked in.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 This argument appeared to posit that members in a company limited by guarantee have a different interest than shareholders in a company limited by shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It is true that shareholders may appear to have a financial interest in their shares, through contribution to the capital, and the possibility of gain therefrom, while members of a company limited by guarantee do not. This difference in interest however does not translate into a difference in treatment for the purposes of s 254 of the CA. There is nothing in the language of that section which would lead to such a conclusion.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 It is also entirely conceivable that members of a company limited by guarantee may suffer prejudice or unfairness in the same way as shareholders. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Re Ingleburn Horse and Pony Club Ltd and the Companies Act </span>[1973] 1 NSWLR 641, Street J held that the remedy of winding up for oppression under s 186 of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW) could also apply in the case of a company limited by guarantee. This was as “disputes can arise and flourish, and oppression can hold sway as freely” in both types of companies, and to deny such a remedy merely due to the fact that the members of a company had not put up a monetary sum by taking shares in the company was an “insubstantial distinction” (at 645). Street J found that oppressive conduct was established, as the committee which managed the company had, amongst other things, resolved to expel several members from the club without providing reasons for such expulsion. However, a winding up order was ultimately not ordered, and the petition was stood over to enable the parties to decide what should be done within the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 On the other hand, winding up was ordered on the just and equitable ground (there, a loss of confidence) as well as on account of oppression in <span class="font-italic">Macquarie University v Macquarie University Union Limited (No 2) </span>[2007] FCA 844 (“<span class="font-italic">University Union</span>”), concerning a company limited by guarantee (“MUU”) which operated as a student union, with the purpose of promoting the welfare of Macquarie University (“the University”) and its members. It was found that certain of the company directors had caused transfers to be made from its bank account and that of its subsidiary (at [38]). These were to ensure that the assets were placed beyond the reach of the University and into their control, contrary to the objects of MUU and in breach of their director’s duties. There had also been unfairness on their part. Appointments to the Board of Directors were made without the knowledge of a director, one Mr Alfonso Maccioni (“Mr Maccioni”) (at [35]). Moreover, they arranged to remove Mr Maccioni and the financial controller of MUU as signatories to certain bank accounts, without the knowledge of the latter (at [36]). In exercising his discretion to wind up the company, Lindgren J found relevant, amongst other factors, that the University intended to restructure the provision of services to students by amalgamating the operations of MUU and its subsidiaries along with other entities (at [43]). He also took the view that it would not be a satisfactory solution for a fresh election of directors to be held, since the directors who had caused these illegitimate transfers could well be re-elected and embark on a similar course of action (at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I note as well that a non-profit company limited by guarantee which was formed for religious purposes was wound up on the just and equitable ground in <span class="font-italic">Gregor and Another v British-Israel-World Federation (NSW) </span>(2002) 41 ACSR 641 (“<span class="font-italic">Gregor</span>”), on account of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the practical impossibility of carrying on the activities of the company due to a bifurcation in its board, which could not be remedied by its members. That was therefore primarily a case of an irretrievable breakdown in relationship amongst its members (see [14(b)] above). Austin J found that there was “bitter conflict in which each side has endeavoured to use the rules of the organisation, frequently mistakenly, to achieve its objectives”; and what was material was that the board of the management of the company “comprise[d] bitterly opposed factions who clearly [could not] work together and make sensible decisions for the future of the company” (at [138] and [141]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 While I did not accept the Plaintiff’s argument on a loss of substratum, the argument may similarly apply to support a just and equitable winding up of a company limited by guarantee. It has been observed that where a company that is not run for profit has no realistic prospect of being able to provide certain services in keeping with its objects, winding up may be ordered on the just and equitable ground (<span class="font-italic">U</span><span class="font-italic">niversity Union</span> at [43]; Derek French, <span class="font-italic">Applications to Wind Up Companies </span>(Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2021) at para 8.263). Winding up was therefore also ordered in <span class="font-italic">Re United Medical Protection of Queensland </span>[2004] NSWSC 14, in relation to a medical defence company limited by guarantee, following a merger with other companies; with the result that, amongst other things, it ceased to provide services to its members or otherwise act in accordance with its objects (at [28]). Ultimately, although the fact that a company is limited by guarantee may impact the degree of unfairness at hand and therefore the exercise of the Court’s discretion in deciding whether to order a winding up (see <span class="font-italic">Re Calabria Community Club Ltd </span>[2013] NSWSC 998 at [127]–[130]), it cannot be said that any unfairness suffered by its members (whether due to unfair conduct on the part of the directors or loss of confidence; or a loss of substratum, as the case may be) will never justify winding up. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Discretion of the Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Returning to the present case, the circumstances considered above supported a winding up. The unfairness occasioned to the Plaintiff and his faction appeared to be a continuing state of affairs, and their exclusion from the matters concerning the Company bore some resemblances with the circumstances in <span class="font-italic">University Union</span>, where it was not clear how any re-election of the directors would resolve matters. The impasse over implementing the Consent Order was also somewhat akin to the situation in <span class="font-italic">Gregor</span>, such that it was doubtful that the Company could continue to be managed effectively.<span class="font-italic"> </span>While the Court’s discretion to consider whether a winding up should be ordered is a broad one, I did not see any reason why my discretion should be exercised against winding up. The reasons supporting the making of a winding up order were not attenuated in any way by any countervailing arguments. Evidence of member support for a winding up of the Company was also inconclusive, with members both in favour of

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Defendant made the general point that winding up was not necessary and that other consequences, including statutory penalties, should be applied. While such penalties were perhaps available through enforcement action, these would not directly vindicate the right to participation that should have been accorded to the members, through voting by their chosen directors, or through scrutiny by the directors of the financial documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The degree of the disregard for minority interests, leading to subversion of the requirements for meetings and consideration of financial documents, evinced an almost contemptuous attitude towards fair dealing with those who were not aligned with the majority. While fairness does not require the majority or those in control to give in to the minority, it does call for at least proper procedure, and that the latter be given the opportunity to try to persuade. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The possible availability of other remedies was therefore not a bar to winding up: whether a winding up should be ordered depended on the extent, scope, and persistence of the conduct complained of. Where such misconduct had persisted for a long period of time, and confidence on the part of the minority members was understandably lacking, the fact that other remedies might be provided for was not enough to stave off winding up. Neither did I find that there was any scope here for the operation of s 254(2A) of the CA, which allows the Court to make an order for the interests in shares of the members to be purchased by the company or other members on terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The main argument that could possibly point against winding up was the fact that the Company served both a social function as well as a religious one. However, such concerns did not bar an order for winding up. Rather, they required that the liquidation be carried out in a sensitive and careful manner. The dissolution of such a company must be carried out in a manner that best preserved, as far as feasible, these functions and allowed them to be transferred, if need be, to another entity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Thus, winding up was ordered, but this was stayed, first in the interim, pending any formal application by the Company for a stay pending appeal. I ordered the stay on the condition that without leave of Court, there would be no disposal or transfer of its property or monies other than in the ordinary course of the running of the Company. If the Company found this onerous, it could apply to the Court, pending appeal, for variation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consequential Remedies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I come to the question of the consequential remedies sought in addition to the winding up of the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Specifically, the Plaintiff asked for a declaration to be made that the balance property should be transferred to the Society. This application by the Plaintiff misconceived the winding up process. The winding up of the Company involved liquidation of the assets, that is, a liquidator would be appointed to bring in the proceeds of assets for distribution first. It was premature to pre-empt what would happen in liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Furthermore, there is no right to specific assets in a liquidation. Even creditors do not have any proprietary interest until the completion of liquidation (<span class="font-italic">Buchler v Talbot</span> [2004] 2 AC 298 at [28]). Members too do not have any property interest in the assets of the company. The Plaintiff relied upon clause 9 of the Company’s Memorandum of Association, which stipulated that any balance remaining on the winding up or dissolution of the Company was to be transferred to an institution with similar objects to the Company as agreed upon by the members, or by an order of the High Court giving effect to the same, or to some charitable object.

</div> However, this clause did not and could not circumvent the insolvency process. It did not bind the Court, and only bound the members between themselves. Furthermore, the application of the <span class="font-italic">cy-pres</span> doctrine by the Court may result in some entity or purpose other than the Society being found appropriate to receive the property or funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 A declaration as sought was also not appropriate as not all necessary parties, in particular the Society, had been brought before the Court, as required by <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and ano</span><span class="font-italic">ther appeal </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 at [14]. There might have been other views about how the property should be disposed of, and how clause 9 of the Company’s Memorandum of Association should operate, particularly by the Commissioner of Charities, who is entrusted under the Charities Act (Cap 37, 2020 Rev Ed) with the supervision of charities. The Court also has a broad jurisdiction over charitable trusts, and it is the Court’s determination of what is a proper application <span class="font-italic">cy-pres</span> that would result in any transfer of property, and not necessarily the Company’s M&amp;A. The status and claim of the Society should be properly tested, and it should seek to appear if it wished to assert any claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Therefore, in the present case, a liquidator should first be appointed under the order for winding up. Given that the property involved the Temple and other assets for the benefit of a section of the public, I was inclined to invite the Official Receiver and Public Trustee to be heard on the possible appointment of a suitable liquidator. The Commissioner for Charities should also be invited at the appropriate juncture to make arguments about any transfer of the Temple and other assets to another charity. I thus brought my decision to the attention of the Attorney-General, as well as the Official Receiver and Public Trustee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Cost directions were given separately.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I must note here what I said in the earlier action which culminated in the Consent Order that came to nought: the needs of the community have not been well served by the disputes between the parties. Mediation did not resolve matters, and even the involvement of eminent persons did not help. I feared that the present legal proceedings would not be the end of things, even when the matter was disposed of on appeal. There was every danger that there would be a downward spiral, with the depletion of resources that were meant to be for the good of the community. Whether that downward trajectory could be arrested was a matter for the persons involved, who claimed to be leaders of that very same Hainanese community.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Hee Theng Fong, Selvaratnam Sharmini Sharon, Poon Pui Yee and Zhuang Changzhong (Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Adrian Tan, Ong Pei Ching, David Aw and Feng Chong We (TSMP Law Corporation) (instructed), Tan Joo Seng, Valerie Ho and Chan Chan Leong (Tyto LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
