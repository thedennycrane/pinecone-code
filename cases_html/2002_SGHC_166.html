<i xmlns=""><b><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">Background </font></b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">1.        The Plaintiff is one Tan

Kok Ing.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">2.        Mr Tan’s claim arises

from a road traffic accident on 11 July 1997 involving two motor vehicles. He sued various

defendants for damages for personal injuries and loss suffered as a result of the motor

accident. He was a passenger in one of these vehicles. His claim was filed in the

Magistrate’s Court on 7 July 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">3.        On 31 January 2002, Mr Tan

filed an application in the Magistrate’s Court to transfer the action from the

Magistrate’s Court to the District Court. The grounds in support of his application

were that when his action was commenced, it appeared that his injuries were less serious

in nature and the general and special damages which he might reasonably expect to be

awarded would not exceed the Magistrate’s Court limit. But since his action was

commenced, Mr Tan alleged that it became apparent that his injuries were more severe than

he had thought. In this regard, he relied on several medical reports. Consequently, his

claim might exceed the Magistrate’s Court limit.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">4.        It was further alleged by

Mr Tan that the transfer of proceeding would not prejudice the defendants.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">5.        Mr Tan’s application

was dismissed by a Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts. He then appealed to a

District Court and that appeal was dismissed. Thereafter, he appealed to the High Court

and that appeal came before me. After hearing arguments, I dismissed the appeal. I now

give my written reasons.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">6.        The relevant provision is s

53 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321). Section 53 states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘<b>Transfer from Magistrate’s Courts to

  District Courts</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">53. A Magistrate’s Court may, either of its own

  motion or on the application of a party to an action, transfer the action to a District

  Court on the ground that some important question of law or fact is likely to arise.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">7.        I was of the view that in

the light of this provision, there was no inherent jurisdiction in the Magistrate’s

Court to transfer an action commenced in the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court

and any such transfer must meet the requirement in s 53, that is, (a) some important

question of law, (b) or fact, is likely to arise. Otherwise s 53 would be otiose. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Order 89 rule 4 of the Rules of Court</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">8.        Before I deal with the

requirements in s 53, I refer to O 89 r 4 of the Rules of Court, on which some reliance

was placed by Mr Cosmas Gomez, Counsel for Mr Tan. This rule provides:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘<b>Transfer of proceedings within the Subordinate

  Courts (O.89, r.4)</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">4. (1) Where a Subordinate Court is satisfied that

  any proceedings in that Court ought to be tried in some other Subordinate Court, it may

  order the proceedings to be transferred to the other Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">    (2) Any order under paragraph (1) may

  be made by the Court on its own motion or on the application by summons of any party to

  the proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">    (3) Where an order under paragraph

  (1) is made by the Court on its own motion, the Registrar must give notice of the transfer

  to every party to the proceedings.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">Mr Gomez was suggesting that this provision would enable

the Magistrate’s Court to effect the transfer without Mr Tan having to satisfy the

requirements in s 53.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">9.        On the other hand, Ms Linda

Phua, Counsel for the First and Second Defendants, submitted that rule 4 provides the

procedure for a transfer only if one of the requirements in s 53 is satisfied and that

rule 4 should not be read in isolation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">10.        I was of the view that O

89 r 4 is not a provision on procedure only. However I agreed that it should not be read

in isolation. If rule 4 were interpreted to mean that any Subordinate Court has an

unfettered discretion to order a transfer of proceedings from a Magistrate’s Court to

a District Court so long as the court ordering the transfer is satisfied that the transfer

ought to be effected, then s 53 would be otiose. It will then effectively override s 53.

In my view, subsidiary legislation cannot override primary legislation and rule 4 must be

read subject to s 53.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">11.        I found support in the

Malaysian case of <i>Kee Chai Heng v Ketua Polis Daerah Kuala Muda</i> [1999] 2 MLJ 671.

In that case, the plaintiff had filed an action against the defendant for negligence for

failing to ensure that he was not harmed whilst under police custody. The action was

commenced in the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court however, on its own initiative, was of

the view that the claim was within the jurisdiction of a lower court, i.e the

Magistrate’s Court. It then ordered that the case be transferred to that court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">12.        On appeal, the High Court

(Alor Setar) ruled that the Sessions Court did not have the power to do so. This was

because para 3(2) of the Third Schedule of their Subordinate Courts Act 1948 gave it power

‘to transfer any proceedings to another court of co-ordinate jurisdiction’ only.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">13.        However, O 47 r 1 of the

Malaysian Subordinate Courts Rules 1980 provided that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘

                                                        

    ORDER 47</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">                                                    

  TRANSFER OF PROCEEDINGS </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">1. Where the Judge of any Court is satisfied that any

    proceedings in that Court can be more conveniently or fairly tried in some other Court he

    may order the proceedings to be transferred to other Court.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">14.        Notwithstanding O 47 r 1,

the Malaysian High Court concluded that this provision must be read subject to para 3(2)

of the Third Schedule of their Subordinate Courts Act as the former was ‘merely a

subsidiary legislation whereas the SCA is an Act of Parliament’ (see p 671 at I of

the report).</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Does the fact that Mr Tan’s claim may exceed the

jurisdiction of the Magistrate’s Court show that some important question of law or

fact is likely to arise?</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">15.        Mr Gomez submitted that

the mere fact that Mr Tan’s claim may exceed the jurisdiction of the

Magistrate’s Court showed that an important question of law or fact was likely to

arise. He relied on two cases.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">16.        In <i>Manakau City Council

v Nicoll Management Co Ltd</i> [1998] DCR 722, the application to transfer a case from the

District Court in Auckland to the High Court was based on s 43(2) of the District Courts

Act 1947 which applies where the value or property or relief claimed in issue does not

exceed $50,000. Under that provision, a judge may order the proceeding to be transferred

to the High Court, if in the judge’s opinion, some important question of law or fact

is likely to arise or a question of title to any hereditament is likely to arise otherwise

than incidentally. In that case, the application was based on some question of law or

fact. Judge R L Johnson enumerated various factors which he said must be taken into

account in such an application:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a) The nature and complexity of the case;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b) The general or public importance of the case;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(c) The amount in issue;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(d) The likely length of the hearing and the financial

    resources of the parties;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(e) Novelty of any point of law raised.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">17.        Mr Gomez relied on factor

(c) and said that this factor alone could satisfy one of the requirements in s 53. There

was no need to establish that Mr Tan’s claim was complex.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">18.        The next case which Mr

Gomez relied on was <i>Patterson and others v Ellis and another</i> [1957] 1 WLR 857. In

that case, the relevant provision was s 44(2)(b) of the County Courts Act which allowed a

transfer of proceedings in a County Court to the High Court if ‘(b) the judge

certifies that in his opinion some important question of law or fact is likely to

arise’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">19.        In the court of first

instance, Judge Gordon Clark held that ‘important’ must mean that the point

affects a number of outside interests or a point of law which affects other cases.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">20.        However, the English Court

of Appeal held that it was too narrow a construction to conclude that the point of law

must affect other cases or that it must be something in the nature of a test case or that

outside interests must be affected. If the difficult question of law or fact arose as

between the parties only, a court could still conclude that important questions of law or

fact are likely to arise.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">21.        Mr Gomez argued that

therefore it was not necessary for Mr Tan’s claim to affect other cases and it was

sufficient if an important question of law or fact is likely to arise as between the

parties.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">22.        Ms Phua submitted that in

both <i>Manakau</i> and <i>Patterson</i>, the application to transfer the proceedings was

not based on the mere fact that the quantum may exceed the lower court’s

jurisdiction.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">23.        She added that if an

action could be transferred for that reason alone, that would require a mini-hearing first

to establish the quantum, where the claim was for unliquidated damages like in the present

case. She found support for this proposition in the Malaysian case of <i>Kee Chai Heng </i>which

I have mentioned above. She cited p 671 where the High Court (Alor Setar) said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘What I have just said above concerns a clear cut

    situation. It might be that in many case the situation is not one that is clear-cut (such

    cases might be common among claims involving unliquidated damages). In such cases, in

    order to avoid unnecessary delay and costs, it is, to my mind, prudent (<i>sic</i>) or the

    sessions court not to entertain the uncertainty and embark on an exercise - more so on its

    own motion - of determining, before the trial even begins, whether the total sum of the

    damages likely to be recovered by the plaintiff would be less than or exceed RM25,000. The

    sessions court should proceed with the trial of the case before it. After all, the

    sessions court is competent to hear such cases: as a general rule, what is within the

    civil jurisdiction of the magistrate’s court is also within the jurisdiction of the

    sessions court. Moreover, in many such cases, the extent of the damages that should be

    awarded could only be determined with certainty after having the benefit of hearing the

    whole evidence and submissions.’ </font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">24.        However, in that case, the

action had been filed in the Sessions Court and the Sessions Court judge, on his own

initiative, took the view that the claim was within the jurisdiction of a lower court i.e

the Magistrate’s Court and he was minded to transfer it to the Magistrate’s

Court. It was in that context that the Malaysian High Court said that the Sessions Court

should not embark on an exercise to determine the quantum even before the trial begins.

After all, the Sessions Court had jurisdiction to proceed with the trial.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">25.        In the case before me, Mr

Tan wanted to do the opposite, i.e to transfer his case from a lower court, i.e the

Magistrate’s Court, to a higher court, i.e the District Court. Accordingly, the

passage cited by Ms Phua did not apply to the case before me.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">26.        In any event, I was of the

view that there is no question of making a mini-inquiry first. If a plaintiff subsequently

takes the view that the quantum of his damages may exceed the jurisdiction of the court in

which he has commenced his action, then he must apply to transfer his action to a higher

court as soon as possible. So long as there is some reasonable basis for his view, it is

not for the court hearing the application to embark on an inquiry to assess the quantum

before deciding whether to transfer the action or not.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">27.        Whether the plaintiff

succeeds in his application is another matter. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">28.        Ms Phua also submitted

that the District Court did not make its decision on the basis that the parties must show

some importance of law or fact to other parties. Hence, <i>Patterson</i> was not relevant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">29.        Ms Phua also contrasted s

53 with s 24(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act. Section 24(1) states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘<b>Transfer of counterclaim from District Court to

    High Court</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">24. (1) Where, in an action founded on contract or tort

    in a District Court, any counterclaim or set-off and counterclaim of any defendant

    involves a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court, any party to the action

    may apply to the High Court, within such time as may be prescribed by Rules of Court, for

    an order that the whole proceedings, or the proceedings on the counterclaim or set-off and

    counterclaim, be transferred to the High Court.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">30.        Ms Phua’s point was

that s 24(1) specifically enables a transfer to be made in the situation where the quantum

in the counterclaim or set-off and counterclaim involves a matter ‘beyond the

jurisdiction’ of the lower court, but no such words are found in s 53 when they could

easily have been included if that was Parliament’s intention.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">31.        As regards the question

whether Mr Tan could use s 24(1), he could not because that provision applied to a

transfer from the District Court to the High Court and not from the Magistrate’s

Court to the District Court. Secondly, it applied only where the amount in the

counterclaim or set-off and counterclaim is beyond the lower court’s jurisdiction and

not where the amount in the main claim itself is beyond that jurisdiction. Thirdly, under

s 24(1), the application is made to the High Court and not to the District Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">32.        Another provision that

showed a contrast to s 53, was s 38 which states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘<b>General power to transfer from District Court

    to High Court</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">38. Where it is made to appear to the High Court, on

    the application of a party to any civil proceeding pending in a District Court, that the

    proceeding by reason of its involving some important question of law, or being a test

    case, or for any other sufficient reason, is one which should be tried in the High Court,

    it may order the record to be transferred to the High Court.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">33.        The words ‘or for any

other sufficient reason’ do not appear in s 53. Also under s 38, the application is

to transfer a civil proceeding in a District Court to the High Court. The application must

also be made to the High Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">34.        Ms Phua also drew my

attention to s 52(1) and the provisions referred to therein but it is not necessary for me

to elaborate on them in my Grounds.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">35.        Ms Adeline Chong, Counsel

for the Third and Fourth Defendants, submitted that when the court in <i>Manakau</i>

raised the amount in issue as one of the factors to be taken into account, this was in the

context of s 43(2) of their District Courts Act 1947 which applies where the value of the

property or relief claimed in issue does not exceed NZ$50,000.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">My Decision</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">36.        I was not certain whether

the reference in <i>Manakau</i> to the amount in issue as being one of the factors to be

considered was because of the limit to the jurisdiction of the District Courts Act under s

43(2) thereof. In any event, that is neither here nor there because there is a limit to

the jurisdiction of our Magistrate’s Court as well.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">37.        Besides, it was clear that

the amount in issue was not the sole or the most important factor in <i>Manakau</i>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">38.        In any event, it was my

view that the amount in issue per se is not a relevant factor in determining whether

‘some important question of law or fact is likely to arise’ under our s 53. A

fortiori, the quantum in itself does not constitute an ‘important question of law or

fact’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">39.        I was of the view that in

order for the question of law or fact to be ‘important’ for the purpose of s 53,

it should affect more than the immediate interests of the parties. It should be applicable

to others as well. A distinction should be drawn between ‘important’ and

‘difficult’. Accordingly, I prefer the decision of Judge Gordon Clark and

respectfully differ from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Patterson</i>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">40.        Even if I were wrong on

this point, I reiterate that even if the amount in issue may be beyond the jurisdiction of

the Magistrate’s Court, that in itself does not show that an ‘important question

of law or fact is likely to arise’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">41.        I agreed that if that was

Parliament’s intention, s 53 would have used similar words as are found in s 24 i.e

‘involves a matter beyond the jurisdiction’ of the Magistrate’s Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">42.        I also agreed that s 38

gives the High Court a wider discretion than s 53 gives to the Magistrate’s Court.

Hence, I have, on other occasions, applied the words ‘or for any other sufficient

reason’ in s 38 to a situation in which the amount in dispute in the District Court

may be beyond the jurisdiction of that court. However, those words are not found in s 53

which applies to an intended transfer from the Magistrate’s Court to the District

Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">43.        I would add that para 10

of the District Court’s Grounds of Decision states, inter alia, that Mr Tan should

apply to the High Court, as opposed to the Magistrate’s Court, for the transfer of

his action to a more appropriate forum. It also states that this view is supported by the

Malaysian case of <i>Kee Chai Heng</i>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">44.        It is true that the

Malaysian High Court in <i>Kee Chai Heng</i> said that only the High Court has the power

to transfer a civil case from a Sessions Court to a Magistrate’s Court and vice

versa. However, while reliance was placed by the court there on para 12 of the Schedule to

the Courts of Judicature Act, the judgment did not elaborate in detail on the provisions

of that Schedule vis--vis their Subordinate Courts Act. Accordingly, I was unable to

derive more assistance from that case on this point.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">45.        On the other hand, I have

recently ruled in Originating Summons No 687 of 2002 <i>Chiltern Park Development Pte Ltd

v Ong Pang Wee &amp; others</i> that the Singapore High Court has no power to transfer an

action from the Magistrate’s Court to the High Court, or, for that matter, from the

Magistrate’s Court to the District Court. I reached this conclusion after considering

our Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) and various provisions in our Subordinate

Courts Act. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">46.        As I said in my judgment

in the <i>Chiltern Park</i> case, the power given to the High Court in Clause 10 of the

First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act is to be read subject to any written

law and the Subordinate Courts Act is such a written law. It seems to me that the only

provision in respect of the transfer of an action from the Magistrate’s Court to the

District Court is s 53. I will elaborate.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">47.        One possible argument is

that s 53 is an enabling provision for a Magistrate’s Court to transfer an action in

the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court and does not circumscribe the powers of

the High Court as given in Clause 10 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of

Judicature Act. So, the High Court can order a transfer from the Magistrate’s Court

to the High Court or to the District Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">48.        While that is an

attractive argument, it seems to me that that is not the scheme under the Subordinate

Courts Act which envisages that an action in the Magistrate’s Court can only be

transferred to the District Court and only an action in the District Court can be

transferred to the High Court. There is no question of a double-jump i.e the transfer of

an action in the Magistrate’s Court to the High Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">49.        As for the question

whether the High Court has the power to order the transfer of an action in the

Magistrate’s Court to the District Court, I am of the view that it does not.

Otherwise the requirements in s 53 would be otiose. The result would be that any litigant

who seeks a transfer of an action in the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court can

by-pass s 53 and apply to the High Court instead and need not meet any of the requirements

in s 53 about ‘some important question of law or fact’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">50.        The District Court also

does not have such a power i.e to transfer an action in the Magistrate’s Court to the

District Court, for the same reason. It would render s 53 otiose.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">51.        I understand that my

decision in the <i>Chiltern Park</i> case is on appeal to the Court of Appeal.</font></p>
