<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Suit 888 of 2012 was started by the Writ of
                    Summons filed on 16 October 2012, and involved a claim by the Plaintiffs against
                    the Defendants for defamation and/or malicious falsehood, and a counterclaim by
                    the Defendants against the Plaintiffs for copyright infringement and passing
                    off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the parties and considering their
                    arguments, I find that the Plaintiffs’ action in defamation succeeds in
                    part. The Defendants’ counterclaim for copyright infringement succeeds.
                    The Defendants’ counterclaim for passing off fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There were a large number of factual disputes
                    and issues which the parties raised. After introducing the parties, I set out a
                    brief summary of the events leading up to the dispute first, and only later
                    discuss my specific findings and further details where relevant to the legal
                    issues before the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Golden Season Pte Ltd (“the First
                    Plaintiff” or “Golden Season”) is a company incorporated in
                    1982 specialising in military and humanitarian relief products. These include
                    ready meals, rescue and medical equipment and military battery assemblies.
                    Designer.SG Pte Ltd (“the Second Plaintiff”) is a company
                    specialising in contemporary home décor products. Ling Yen Wu (“the Third
                    Plaintiff” or “Tedric”) is the sales director of the First
                    Plaintiff and the design director of the Second Plaintiff (the plaintiffs
                    collectively referred to as “the Plaintiffs”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Whilst Golden Season is in the business of
                    providing (selling) military and humanitarian relief products to organisations
                    including non-governmental organisations (“NGO”) such as Mercy
                    Relief, it is also apparent that they are active in various charitable causes.
                    This includes donating relief products and providing services during disasters,
                    for example, during the Szechuan Earthquake in 2007. Mercy Relief was not just a
                    “customer” of Golden Season: it was also an NGO with whom Golden
                    Season worked with on charitable causes connected with disaster relief. This
                    included help with fund raising.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd (“the
                    First Defendant” or “Kairos”) was incorporated in July 2010
                    and provides inflatable boats, marine products and yacht charter services. The
                    inflatable boats were suitable for activities such as fishing as well as for use
                    in flood disaster relief work. Roy Soeigiarto (“the Second
                    Defendant” or “Roy”) is the director of the First Defendant
                    (the defendants collectively referred to as “the
                    Defendants”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This dispute was set against the backdrop of the
                    2011 monsoon season which caused severe and prolonged flooding in Thailand. This
                    resulted in an urgent need for rescue equipment including inflatable boats and
                    related gear to assist the disaster relief effort.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The First Order and donation to Mercy Relief </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 12 October 2011, Tedric contacted Roy
                    (through a message on an internet site) expressing his interest to purchase
                    inflatable boats and other suitable equipment for donation purposes in aid of
                    the floods in Thailand. For convenience, the message is set out
                        below:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hello, our company is intending to donate inflatable boats for the recent
                        floods in Thailand. May i [<em>sic</em>] know what you
                        have in stock for supply? We would also appreciate if you are able to quote
                        your best prices as this is intended for disaster relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It would appear that Tedric had initially made
                    the purchase representing the Second Plaintiff, but later decided that it would
                    be the First Plaintiff who would be making the purchase. In any case, it is not
                    disputed that the purpose of the boats (<em>ie</em>, for
                    use in the Thailand floods) was made known to the Defendants. After some
                    correspondence, Tedric placed an order on 13 October 2011 for 16 inflatable
                    boats (comprising 10 KB 430 boats and 6 KB 528XL boats) and two outboard motors
                    (comprising one 5.8hp motor and one 10hp motor) (“the First
                        Order”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.
                    Golden Season paid S$ 23,844 to Kairos for the first order. Along with the first
                    order, Roy also donated two additional KB 430 boats, one used generator and two
                    used chainsaws (“the Kairos Donated Items”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There were two other purchases of boats from
                    the Defendants, which will be elaborated on later, but in total, the Plaintiffs
                    would donate 18 inflatable boats (not including the two boats that the
                    Defendants donated) and 4 motors to Mercy Relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Kairos Donated Items were also passed on
                    to Mercy Relief. Mercy Relief later acknowledged these donations in a letter
                    dated 21 October 2011 addressed to Tedric and the First Plaintiff (“the
                    Acknowledgement Letter”). It is not disputed that the Acknowledgement
                    Letter was not made known to the Defendants until sometime later. As will be
                    seen, this was the cause of much unhappiness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The inflatable boats stocked and sold by
                    Kairos were sourced from a Chinese Original Equipment Manufacturer
                    (“OEM”). The boats were sold by Kairos under the Kairos Mark
                    comprising the name “Kairos Inflatable” set out within a fish
                    symbol. The term “Inflatable Sampans” was also used in marketing
                    the boats.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The meeting at the Plaintiffs’ office and the Exclusive
                Reseller Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The parties continued to correspond with each
                    other primarily through email. The contents of these emails generally entailed
                    discussions of prices and features of the various boat models that the
                    Defendants offered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the midst of such discussions, a meeting
                    between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants was arranged. While parties are not
                    certain at which date this meeting occurred, it is clear that it occurred before
                    28 October 2011, the day a training session on how to operate the Kairos boats
                    was held (see below at [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     During this meeting, the Plaintiffs allege
                    that they entered into an agreement with the Defendants, whereby the Plaintiffs
                    would become the <em>exclusive</em> reseller of the
                    Defendants’ boats, outboard motors and electrical pumps (at least to
                    humanitarian organisations) (the “Exclusive Reseller Agreement”).
                    It is also during this meeting that the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants
                    had given the Plaintiffs permission to use photos of the boats owned by the
                    Defendants, and even allowed the Plaintiffs to remove the logo of the Defendants
                    on such photos so that the Plaintiffs could market the goods as their own.
                    Furthermore, the Plaintiffs also claim that the Defendants agreed to remove
                    their prices from the Internet and not to publish their prices
                anymore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Clearly, what was agreed upon during this
                    meeting is an issue of dispute between the parties. This will be especially
                    relevant for the purposes of the Defendants’ counterclaim in copyright
                    infringement and passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Second and Third Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Tedric later placed a second order on 27
                    October 2011 for two KB 528XL boats, one 5.8HP motor, and one 10 HP motor
                    (“the Second Order”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Finally, on 31 October 2011, Tedric
                    made a final order of ten more inflatable boats (comprising eight KS 320 boats
                    and two KS 330 boats) (“the Third Order”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. Including the
                    first order, Tedric purchased 28 boats and four motors from the Defendants in
                    total:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     10 KB 430 boats (all during the
                        First Order);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     8
                        KB 528XL boats (six during the First order and two during the Second
                        order);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     8 KS
                        320 boats (all during the Third Order);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     2 KS 330 boats (all during the <u>Third</u> Order);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     2 5.8hp motors (one during the First Order and another
                        during the Second Order); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_f"></a>(f)     2 10hp motors (one during the First Order and another
                        during the Second Order).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Although the Plaintiffs eventually purchased a
                    total of 28 boats from the Defendants, only 18 of these were donated to Mercy
                    Relief as mentioned above. According to the Plaintiffs, the remaining boats were
                    “earmarked for [Mercy Relief]’s future missions and were
                        warehoused”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> by
                    the Plaintiffs. The Defendants claim that they were unaware of this, and were
                    under the impression that <em>all</em> the boats would
                    immediately be deployed in the Thailand floods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Up to this point, there is also dispute as to
                    whether discounts were offered and provided by Roy, and if they were, the reason
                    why these discounts were offered. What is also in dispute is whether Roy knew of
                    the existence of Mercy Relief and that the boats were intended for use by Mercy
                    Relief (as opposed to simply for flood relief work) <em>before</em> 28 October 2011. This will be dealt with
                later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The training session on 28 October 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 28 October 2011, the Defendants carried out
                    a training session to demonstrate how to operate the Defendants’ boats and
                    other equipment. This training session was arranged by the Plaintiffs. However,
                    it was attended by Mr Francis Lee (“Francis”), previously the
                    Strategic and Partnership Director of Mercy Relief. During this training
                    session, Francis took the following items from the Defendants:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     1 portable electric pump GP80DT
                        (“the electric pump”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     1 bale of rope of 100 metres length (“the
                        rope”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     4 units of LED waterproof blinker lights (“the LED blinker
                        lights”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     According to the Defendants, it was agreed
                    that Francis would be buying the rope “through Golden Season”.
                    This would mean that Mercy Relief would pay Golden Season, and after which,
                    Golden Season would pay the Defendants for the price of the rope. For the
                    remaining two items, it is in dispute as to whether or not the items were on
                    loan to Mercy Relief, or whether the same payment arrangements as the rope had
                    been agreed upon. Whatever it is, the Defendants claim that the Plaintiffs never
                    paid them for any of the above items.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The chain of emails after the training session</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     After the training session, Roy sent the
                    Plaintiffs an invoice on 31 October 2011 billing the Plaintiffs for the electric
                    pump, the rope and the LED blinker lights. Roy followed up with an email dated 1
                    November 2011 mentioning that Francis had taken the electric pump to
                        Thailand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 2 November 2011, a heated chain of emails
                    was exchanged between Roy and Tedric.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The main point Tedric wanted to convey
                    in these emails was that the Defendants should, as far as possible, not be in
                    direct communication with the Plaintiffs’ clients. Tedric was also worried
                    that the Defendant had disclosed the prices of certain items to Mercy Relief
                    during the training session. This was the start of the breakdown of the
                    relationship between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The sale to Singapore Red Cross </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 8 November 2011, the Singapore Red Cross
                    (“SRC”) issued a press release announcing that it was donating
                    boats to Thailand as well. The Plaintiffs thus became aware that the Defendants
                    had sold their boats directly to the SRC as there were photos with boats bearing
                    the Defendants’ logo. The Plaintiffs were unhappy that the Defendants had
                    bypassed them to sell to the SRC direct and thereafter instructed one Mr Kenny
                    Ng (“Kenny”), the purchasing manager of Golden Season, to source
                    for alternative suppliers of inflatable boats and motors. Amongst the suppliers
                    that Kenny found was Rongcheng Bestband Industry Co Ltd, Shandong,
                    People’s Republic China (“Rongcheng”). As it turned out,
                    Rongcheng was also the Defendants’ inflatable boat supplier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It was during this period when the Plaintiffs
                    started to distribute brochures to advertise the sales of “Golden
                    Season” boats. According to the Defendants, the pictures used in these
                    brochures are unauthorised reproductions of photos owned by the Defendants and
                    contained photos of the Defendants’ boats with the Defendants’ logo
                    removed. This forms the basis of the Defendants’ counterclaim in copyright
                    infringement and passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 22 November 2011, Roy wrote three emails.
                    The first at 9.55am was an email to the Defendants’ suppliers, where Roy
                    warned his suppliers that there was a “reseller” that was trying
                    to bypass the Defendants and were going straight to the Defendants’
                    clients and suppliers. This email included the text and body of an email that
                    Kenny had sent to a supplier when he was sourcing for alternative suppliers, and
                    clearly identified Golden Season. The second email at 10.56am was sent to
                    Christopher Chua (“Chua”), Secretary-General of the SRC. This
                    second email contained the first email with a short explanation that Roy was
                    trying to “set things right”. The third email sent at 6.47pm was a
                    relatively cordial email addressed to Tedric, where Roy tried to re-affirm the
                    working relationship between the parties. Roy also offered that an agreement
                    could be signed where parties should not sell to each other’s clients.
                    Tedric did not reply to this email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Chua later offered to mediate the matter
                    between the parties, and sent an email to Tedric on 23 November 2011. In the
                    exchange of emails on the same day<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, Chua also clarified that it was him
                    who approached the Defendants for boats for Thailand. He had found the
                    Defendants by conducting a search on the internet. The Plaintiffs sought a
                    number of clarifications as to how the Defendants had acted in the sale to the
                    SRC, including whether the Defendants had asserted that they owned any
                    intellectual property over the boats and that they could not be purchased from
                    the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On 24 November 2011, Tedric sent a text
                    message to Roy asking him how long he had been doing business with the SRC. Roy
                    did not reply to this text message. On 25 November 2011, Roy sent an email to
                    the SRC relating the dispute between the Defendants and the Plaintiffs which
                    included the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Plaintiffs had pressed the
                        Defendants to give details on the business relationship between the
                        Defendants and the SRC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the Defendants never gave the Plaintiffs permission
                        to use the Defendants’ photos for the Plaintiffs’ brochures, and
                        that the Plaintiffs were using “other people’s product to
                        pose” as their own; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the Plaintiffs had purchased the Defendants’
                        boats only to resell them to Mercy Relief at “an undisclosed
                        amount”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The emails to Mercy Relief</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 28 November 2011, the Defendants wrote to
                    Mercy Relief, and received an auto-reply from Mercy Relief. The contents of this
                    email are not known.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On 29 November 2011, the Defendants wrote to
                    the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Mercy Relief seeking an
                    acknowledgment of the Donated Kairos Items, as well as the discounts that the
                    Defendants had given the Plaintiffs, claiming that this was necessary for
                    “stock audit, tax and accounting purposes”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It would appear
                    that the Defendants never received a response to this letter until sometime
                    during mid-December 2011. In any case, the evidence shows that on 7 December
                    2011, the Defendants sent another email to Mercy Relief, and in turn, received a
                    further auto-reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It was after this that the Defendants started
                    on what the Plaintiffs call the Defendants’ “defamation
                    campaign”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">An overview of the defamatory articles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The following is a brief summary of what the
                    Plaintiffs assert are defamatory of them:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     two Facebook posts posted by Roy on
                        10 December 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     eight emails sent to various recipients, including Mercy Relief, the
                        SRC and their officers, sent in the period between 13 December 2011 and 23
                        February 2011; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     a phone text message sent to Francis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As an action in defamation is essentially
                    fact-centric, it is important to understand the context in which this dispute
                    arises. It is clear from the above outline that, at the very least, there was
                    some miscommunication and unhappiness in how parties had appeared to have acted
                    in their business relationship. The Plaintiffs were unhappy that the Defendants
                    seemed to have bypassed them and contacted their clients (<em>ie</em>, SRC) while the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    appeared to be unhappy with the fact that his donations might have gone
                    unnoticed by Mercy Relief as they had not replied to him. This is the brief
                    background against which the alleged defamatory articles came about. In general,
                    the two Facebook posts were posts by Roy on his personal and business page
                    commenting on the spate of events that had occurred, and the eight emails were
                    correspondences with authorities whom the Defendants thought were relevant to
                    the dispute. I elaborate on this in the later paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The legal issues before this court are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     For the Plaintiffs’ action in
                        defamation -</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_34-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether the articles are
                            defamatory of the Plaintiffs;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_34-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       if they are, whether any defences are
                            applicable; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_34-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       if applicable, the quantum of damages to be
                            awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     For the Defendants’ counterclaim -</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_34-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether the Plaintiffs had
                            infringed on the copyright belonging to the Defendants;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_34-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       whether the Plaintiffs were liable in the tort of passing off (inverse
                            passing off).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable law – Defamation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The law of defamation is relatively
                    well-settled and I set out the general principles applicable in this case. The
                    tort of defamation is concerned with protecting a person’s reputation,
                    namely, what other people think of him. The classic elements to establish the
                    tort of defamation are that there must be:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     a statement bearing a defamatory
                        meaning;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     publication to a third party; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     reference made to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     A statement is considered to be defamatory if
                    it:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     lowers the plaintiff in the
                        estimation of right-thinking members of society
                    generally;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     causes
                        the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     exposes the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or
                        ridicule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>See Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <em>The
                        Law of Torts in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2011) ("<em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em>") at para
                12.014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Whether a statement is defamatory is generally
                    determined based on the construction of the natural and ordinary meaning of the
                    words used. As summarised by the Court of Appeal in <em>Chan
                        Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another
                        appeal</em> [2012] 1 SLR 506 ("<em>Chan Cheng
                        Wah</em>") at [18], the following guiding principles apply:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     the natural and ordinary meaning of
                        a word is that which is conveyed to an ordinary reasonable
                    person;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     as the test
                        is objective, the meaning which the defendant intended to convey is
                        irrelevant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        ordinary reasonable reader is not avid for scandal but can read between the
                        lines and draw inferences;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     where there are a number of possible interpretations,
                        some of which may be non-defamatory, such a reader will not seize on only
                        the defamatory one;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a>(e)     the ordinary reasonable reader is treated as having read the
                        publication as a whole in determining its meaning, thus “the bane and
                        the antidote must be taken together”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_f"></a>(f)     the ordinary reasonable reader will
                        take note of the circumstances and manner of the
                publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Apart from establishing that the statement is
                    defamatory, it must also be shown that it is the plaintiff who has been defamed
                    by the publication of the statement. There is no need for the plaintiff to be
                    named, but it must be shown that the words would be understood by ordinary
                    people to refer to the plaintiff. The act of publication and reference to the
                    plaintiff are key elements of the tort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Once the above are established, the defendant
                    will be liable for defamation unless he can rely on defences such as
                    justification, qualified privilege or fair comment. I further elaborate on the
                    relevant legal principles specific to each article later on when
                    necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Are the elements of the tort of defamation made out?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Facebook posts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On 10 December 2011 at 9.58pm, Roy posted on
                    his personal Facebook page:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My photos and text for my inflatable boats have been doctored and used by
                        some companies! We don’t appoint resellers and if you know of someone

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Roy followed up with a comment posted on 11 December at 9.30am,
                    stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yes….apparently some folks approached me on the pretext of donation

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I refer to the above post as well as the comment collectively as
                    the “First Facebook Post”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On 10 December 2011 at 11.11pm, the First
                    Defendant posted on its business Facebook page:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Flood victims deserve the best! Donor’s money should be used wisely
                        – we supply portable rescue and supply inflatable sampans and
                        boats.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No more 3rd party nonsence [<em>sic</em>] – we
                        learnt that recently! Read last post!</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Roy then followed up with three comments. The first:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mercy Relief users in Thailand and Cambodia got their supplies of
                        kairosinflatables [<em>sic</em>] at $1184. We have to
                        inform that the 3rd party obtained that from us. We support NGOs and gave
                        them huge discounts and donations. We hope that they will aknowledge
                            [<em>sic</em>] and not be sold or passed off as
                        other supplier’s items at prices we do not know. Donor’s money
                        must be used wisely and we promote direct purchases to avoid any
                        misunderstanding if any. Now it seems others are using our copyright photos
                        and models we created to pass off as theirs!</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The second:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Copyright infringement is an offence. We also hope that these NGOs who got
                        from 3rd parties will confirm with us that the prices are what they got it
                        for. We own the brand and maintain our competitive prices so that
                        donor’s funds are used wisely. No markups ! [<em>sic</em>]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>And the third:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mercy Relief used our inflatables to rescue and supply food and water.We
                            [<em>sic</em>] supplied through a 3rd party giving

                        instead. That’s our concern.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Tedric responded to the thread of comments by commenting:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Tedric Ling</b> Dear Roy, I just read all your
                        posts. What are you trying to imply?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Second Defendant then replied to the thread stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear all, by following on this thread, it seems like the some folks are
                        feeling the heat……</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I refer to the later posts and string of comments collectively as
                    the “Second Facebook Post”. It is noted that the Second Facebook
                    Post was posted about an hour after the First Facebook Post.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the statement of claim dated 16 October
                    2012, it is pleaded that the words contained in the Facebook Posts were
                    defamatory in their ordinary and natural meaning in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>a.     The First and Third Plaintiffs
                        deceived, tricked and conned the Defendants into selling the Kairos
                        boats/sampans at a discounted price whilst having no intention whatsoever to
                        donate the same to a charitable cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>b.     The First and Third Plaintiffs did not donate the GS
                        donations or donate used items to Mercy Relief but instead sold them to
                        Mercy Relief for a profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>c.     In so deceiving, tricking and conning the Defendants, the
                        First and Third Plaintiffs are crooks and cheats.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Defendants argue that read in their
                    ordinary and plain meaning, the Facebook posts are not defamatory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> I
                    disagree. In my view, the First Facebook Post strongly suggests that the
                    Defendants have been cheated by “some folks” – these unnamed
                    third parties had approached the Defendants on the “pretext” of
                    donation but did not make any donation, suggesting that they had lied. For the
                    Second Facebook Post, it is important to note that the thread of comments was
                    prefaced with the original post which stated “no more 3rd party
                    [nonsense]”, which is strongly suggestive of malpractices. There are then
                    several comments asserting that donor’s monies should be used wisely. Read
                    together, it would be reasonable for an ordinary man to surmise that the post is
                    made in reference to the malpractices of these unnamed third parties, which
                    caused donor’s monies to be used unwisely. The continual stress on
                    corporate discounts and the prices charged suggest some form of overcharging.
                    Furthermore, it would be odd to mention in the abstract that “[c]opyright
                    infringement is an offence.” This clearly suggests an incident of
                    copyright infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In <em>ABZ v Singapore Press
                        Holdings Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 648 at [31], it was held that if a
                    statement was made suggesting that the plaintiff conducted its business in a
                    dishonest, improper or inefficient manner, it would be defamatory of the
                    plaintiff. The words/phrases “cheating”, “should be used
                    wisely”, and “nonsense”, for example, all suggest some form
                    of dishonesty or some form of business misconduct, and therefore, I find that
                    both the First and the Second Facebook Posts bear defamatory
                meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The real challenge, however, is for the
                    Plaintiffs (in particular the First and Third Plaintiff) to establish that the
                    two Facebook posts refer to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Whether or not something refers to or
                    identifies a plaintiff is an issue of mixed law and fact. As explained by
                    Viscount Simon LC in <em>Knupffer v London Express Newspaper,
                        Limited</em> [1944] AC 116 at 121 and cited with approval in <em>Mohamed Hussain v Chew How Yang Eddie</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R)
                    916 at [36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first question is a question of law – can the article having
                        regard to its language, be regarded as capable of referring to the
                        appellant? The second question is a question of fact – Does the
                        article, in fact, lead reasonable people, who know the appellant, to the
                        conclusion that it does refer to him? Unless the first question can be
                        answered in favour of the appellant, the second question does not
                        arise...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Ultimately, the question before the court is
                    whether based on the Facebook posts, a reasonable person <em>could</em> identify the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs, essentially, rely
                    on two arguments to establish this:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Plaintiffs argue that
                        they are widely known to be associated with Mercy Relief.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> A simple search on
                        an internet search engine or the search engine available in Facebook would
                        allow the ordinary and sensible reader to surmise that the Defendants were
                        referring to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Plaintiffs also argue that Tedric had
                        commented on the Second Facebook Post, and thus had identified himself. The
                        ordinary reader would then understand that the comments were made in
                        reference to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs also argue that the ordinary
                        reader would associate the First Facebook Post with the Second Facebook
                        Post, and therefore, when Tedric had identified himself in the Second
                        Facebook Post, readers would also understand that the First Facebook Post
                        was referring to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     There are three questions to be explored in
                    considering the Plaintiffs’ arguments. First, pertaining to the Second
                    Facebook Post, will a defendant still be liable for defamation if the defamatory
                    article does not identify the Plaintiff but for the Plaintiff’s act of
                    self-identification? Second, can the Plaintiffs rely on its identification in
                    the Second Facebook Post such that the Plaintiffs are also identified in the
                    First Facebook Post? Third, can the Plaintiffs rely on the fact that they are
                    easily associated with Mercy Relief such that an ordinary person would read the
                    Facebook posts to be in reference to them?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Second Facebook Post – self-identification by the Plaintiff </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Can a plaintiff rely on his
                    “self-identification” in alleging that a defendant’s
                    publication has defamed him? While there seems to be little case authority to
                    give guidance on this point, it stands to reason that this cannot be the
                    position. Starting from first principles, it is clear that it must be the
                        <em>defendant’s publication</em> that identifies
                    the plaintiff before liability will attach (assuming that defamatory meaning is
                    already found), and not the act of the plaintiff. A plaintiff who goes around
                    announcing that something published by the defendant actually refers to him
                    cannot rely on that very same act in arguing that the defendant’s
                    publication now refers to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Take, for example, a newspaper which publishes
                    an article claiming that a certain unnamed businessman is guilty of dishonest
                    practices. An individual thinking that the newspaper is referring to him,
                    publishes a public refute claiming that the newspaper is defaming him. Assuming
                    that a case of <em>innuendo</em> (reference to the
                    individual) cannot be made out, it would be absurd if the individual could rely
                    on his own act of publication and identification in order to claim that the
                    newspaper article refers to him. From an objective point of view, the
                    newspaper’s publication did not refer to the plaintiff. In such a
                    situation, unless the plaintiff can show some form of innuendo that links the
                    defendant’s publication to the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s action
                    must fail. This would be answering the first question as posed by Viscount Simon
                    LC – as a matter of law, the article, having regard to its language, is
                    not capable of referring to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Applying the reasoning to this case, the fact
                    that Tedric subsequently “identified” himself by responding to the
                    thread of comments cannot in itself cause the Defendant’s Second Facebook
                    Post to now identify him. However, there is one significant difference between
                    the newspaper example discussed above and the present case. After Tedric had
                    “identified” himself, Roy went on to post a comment in the
                    thread:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear all, by following on this thread, it seems like the some folks are
                        feeling the heat……</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I refer to this comment as “Roy’s
                    response comment”. A larger question belies this inquiry – what
                    exactly is the Defendants’ publication? Given the advances in digital
                    technology and the rising popularity of “instant” electronic
                    communication, a Facebook post which allows for and generates comments by means
                    of posts under a thread, all of which are published instantly, is much more
                    dynamic (as a publication/communication medium) than a print newspaper
                    article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In Matthew Collins, <em>The Law
                        of Defamation and the Internet</em> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed,
                    2005), the learned author at paras 5.24 to 5.25 elaborates:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Place and time of
                            publication</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Matter is published at the time when, and in the place where, it is
                        received. Each copy of a book or newspaper is thus a separate publication,
                        as is each reception of a television or radio broadcast. Each separate
                        publication of the same matter potentially gives rise to a distinct cause of
                        action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arguments that different rules should apply to matter published via the
                        Internet, having regard to its global and geographically indeterminate
                        nature, and the spectre of Internet publishers being exposed to the risk of
                        defamation actions in every corner of the globe, have not found judicial
                        favour. Each receipt of a defamatory e-mail message or bulletin board
                        posting, and <em>each display of a defamatory web page, is
                            thus a separate publication</em>, in respect of which a distinct
                        cause of action potentially arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The number of computers through which the message has passed is therefore
                        not to the point; <em>it is the number of computers on which
                            the message has been displayed and seen</em> that determines how
                        many separate publications of the message have occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In <em>Webb v Bloch</em>
                    (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 363, Isaacs J commented that publication of a libel is
                    “to convey by some means to the mind of another the defamatory sense
                    embodied in the vehicle.” In this sense, it has been said by the High
                    Court of Australia in <em>Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc v
                        Gutnick</em> (2002) 210 CLR 575 at [26] that publication is a
                    bilateral act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Harm to reputation is done when a defamatory article is comprehended by
                        the reader, the listener, or the observer. Until then, no harm is done by
                        it. This being so it would be wrong to treat publication as if it were a
                        unilateral act on the part of the publisher alone. It is not. It is a
                        bilateral act – in which the publisher makes it available and a third
                        party has it available for his or her comprehension.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It follows that every time an individual
                    displays or views a Facebook post on his computer, it counts as a separate
                    publication. This is important because given the ability to comment on a thread
                    on a Facebook post means that potentially, the <em>content</em> of the publication continues to change. A newspaper
                    article in most cases, remains in the same form as it was when originally
                    published, editorial corrections aside. Later articles may revise or develop
                    themes and issues discussed in the first article. The reality of Facebook and
                    other social networking sites is that every time the author of a Facebook post
                    comments on his own post, he is essentially “building on” the
                    original publication. The Facebook post and the thread of comments bear a
                    passing resemblance to a conversation. Later comments really belong to a single
                    thread of comments originating from the same post. For this reason I am of the
                    view that in many cases it is most probable that they will be read together and
                    thus should be treated as a single publication. This can be likened to a
                    newspaper who <em>re-publishes</em> the same article
                    (previously published), but now with a descriptive or elaborative passage in
                    another column beside it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Bringing this to the case at hand, by
                    responding to Tedric’s comment on his Second Facebook Post, Roy can be
                    said to have “built on” his original publication in such a way as
                    to confirm Tedric’s identity. From a legal point of view, the whole string
                    of comments now has to be read together, and, in my judgment, form a singular
                    instance of publication. This is different from taking the perspective that the
                    original post and Roy’s response comment are two different sets of
                    publications. This difference is critical because the Defendants rely on the
                    case of <em>Grappelli v Derek Block (Holdings) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1981] 1 WLR 822 CA (“<em>Grappelli</em>”) to
                    argue that there is a general rule that a statement is to be understood in the
                    way in which a reasonable recipient would understand it at the time it is
                    published; subsequent knowledge which makes the recipient look back on it in a
                    different light will not make it defamatory (See also <em>Gatley
                        on Libel &amp; Slander</em> (Patrick Milmo &amp; W V H Rogers eds)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 2008) at para 7.4 (“<em>Gatley</em>”)). Even accepting the general rule at
                    face value, it is clear that <em>Grappelli</em> does not
                    apply here because there is no “subsequent knowledge” – the
                    string of comments and the original post are one singular publication. To be
                    fair, the Defendants rely on <em>Grappelli</em> in relation
                    to another point, but its possible applicability for this issue should be
                    clarified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Viewed from the perspective of a singular
                    publication, the issue of self-identification then becomes less important.
                    Applying the two questions as posed by Viscount Simon LC, the two questions
                    before the court are therefore: considering the entire Second Facebook Post
                    including Roy’s response comment, as a question of law, can it having
                    regard to its language, be regarded as capable of referring to Tedric, and as a
                    question of fact, does it in fact lead reasonable people to the conclusion that
                    it does refer to him? I had mentioned above that it must the <em>defendant’s publication</em> which identifies the plaintiff. To
                    this end, although it goes without saying that Tedric’s response
                    identifies himself, I find that Roy’s response comment is <em>also</em> capable of identifying the Third Plaintiff (Tedric)
                    given the circumstances in which it was made. By commenting immediately after
                    Tedric’s comment that “some people” were “following
                    the post”, I find that it is possible that a reasonable man would surmise
                    that Roy’s comment was referring to Tedric, who was “following the
                    post”. As a result, I find that the Plaintiffs’ action of
                    defamation on the Second Facebook Post succeeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For completeness, I note that the Plaintiffs
                    also argued that they were highly associated with Mercy Relief, and a simple
                    internet search would have enabled the ordinary reader to discover that the
                    Defendants were referring to the Plaintiffs in the Second Facebook Post. Given
                    my findings above, there is no longer a need for the Plaintiffs to rely on this,
                    but I would state that if they were to succeed based on this, the Plaintiffs
                    would have to prove that the ordinary reasonable reader was likely to have
                    undertaken an internet search in order to identify the Plaintiff. To this end,
                    little evidence was led to establish this point, but in any case, as mentioned,
                    it was not required of me to make a finding on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The First Facebook Post – reliance on the Second Facebook
                Post</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Plaintiffs argue that since the Second
                    Facebook Post identifies the Plaintiffs, readers would naturally understand the
                    First Facebook Post to refer to the Plaintiffs. As explained in <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> at para 12.049:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ordinary third party’s knowledge of the particular circumstances
                        and facts in which the publication was made would be relevant in determining
                        whether reference was made to the plaintiff. In the case of true innuendos,
                        the third party with special knowledge of the extrinsic facts must
                        reasonably understand the defamatory words as referring to the
                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In order to succeed, the Plaintiffs would have
                    to prove that the ordinary reasonable reader had knowledge of the Second
                    Facebook Post. The Plaintiffs are therefore relying on another publication to
                    establish reference. The following passage from <em>Gatley
                        2013</em> at para 7.4 is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general rule is that a statement is to be understood in the way in
                        which a reasonable recipient would understand it at the time it is
                        published: subsequent knowledge which makes the recipient look back on it in
                        a different light will not make it defamatory. Exceptionally, however, a
                        subsequent publication may be introduced in evidence to establish
                        identification. Thus, in <em>Hayward v Thompson</em> it
                        was held, in a case where the words in the first publication were defamatory
                        on their face and the second publication that identified the plaintiff was
                        published by the defendant, that reference could be made to a second
                        publication in order to establish identification…Ultimately, whether
                        evidence from subsequent publication should be allowed to establish
                        identification in these cases depends on a careful consideration of the
                        facts of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Plaintiffs argue that Roy’s friends,
                    who would have seen the First Facebook Post, would also have been supporters of
                    his business, and would therefore have also seen the Second Facebook
                        Post.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    It bears repeating that the First Facebook Post was on Roy’s personal
                    Facebook page. The Second Facebook Post was on Kairos’s business Facebook
                    page. In such circumstances, the Plaintiffs argue that this would allow them to
                    have the necessary knowledge to conclude that the First Facebook Post refers to
                    the Plaintiffs. On a balance of probabilities, I disagree. The fact that a
                    number of readers might have access to both posts does not lead to the
                    conclusion that they would have observed these two posts and then conclude that
                    the First Facebook Post refers to the Plaintiffs. More importantly, it is noted
                    that the reference to Tedric in the Second Facebook Post was also formed
                    sometime later, only after Roy’s response comment was posted. In those
                    circumstances, a reader would have to be cognizant of the Second Facebook Post
                    at this stage, and then go back to the First Facebook Post to establish the
                    reference to the Plaintiffs. In such circumstances I hold that the general rule
                    in <em>Grappelli</em> applies, and that the Plaintiffs
                    should not be able to rely on the Second Facebook Post to establish reference to
                    the Plaintiffs in the First Facebook Post. As such, the Plaintiffs’ action
                    based on the First Facebook Post fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Publication</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     For purposes of completeness, I also find that
                    there is no difficulty in establishing that there is publication by means of the
                    Facebook posts. Whether or not the publication was substantial is a matter of
                    damages which will be considered later in the event that no defence is

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I refer to these emails collectively as the “chain of
                    emails”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The same legal question that must be answered
                    is whether the content of the chain of emails is defamatory in nature. The
                    defendants argue that the chain of emails was sent by Roy because Roy was in a
                    “perplexing situation”. As mentioned above, on 29 November 2011,
                    Roy had written to Hassan seeking an acknowledgment of the Donated Kairos Items
                    and the discounts that the Defendants had given the Plaintiffs, but had not
                    received any reply from Hassan or Mercy Relief. The chain of emails from Roy was
                    therefore in pursuit of his “legitimate interest in asking the charity he
                    had donated to about how the donations had been received”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> (or not, as the case may be). To this end, I
                    share some sympathy for Roy insofar as the replies from the various parties may
                    not have been as clear as they could have been in addressing <em>directly</em> the concerns raised by Roy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     However, even if the replies Roy received to
                    his email queries could be said to be unsatisfactory, it does not cure or excuse
                    any defamatory sting in the contents of the email queries. Simply because the
                    Defendants received an unsatisfactory reply from a third party does not give
                    them the right to make defamatory remarks of another, especially so when this is
                    based on personal uncorroborated suspicions. That said, the reason for sending
                    the email queries may allow Roy to rely on the defence of qualified privilege,
                    which will be considered later on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Plaintiffs assert that the chain of emails
                    bears a number of defamatory imputations. As in the case of the Facebook posts,
                    the words complained of in the eight emails were pleaded to be defamatory in
                    their natural and ordinary meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     For convenience, the Plaintiff said to be
                    defamed by each email<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> are as follows:</p>

                        6: Primarily the First and Third Plaintiffs. Second Plaintiff in respect of
                        an allegation that it gave the Defendants permission to use photographs
                        belonging to Mercy Relief;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_g"></a>(g)     Email 7: Primarily the First and Third Plaintiffs. Second
                        Plaintiff in respect of an allegation that it gave the Defendants permission

                        Plaintiffs. Second Plaintiff in respect of allegations of outstanding debts
                        and permission to use the photographs belonging to Mercy
                    Relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In respect of each email, the Statement of
                    Claim sets out the particular words said to be defamatory. Detailed particulars
                    of the defamatory meaning (on the basis of the natural and ordinary meaning) of
                    the words were also set out in the Statement of Claim in respect of each
                    email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Since many of the statements and alleged
                    meanings are repetitive or similar, a few examples of the alleged natural and
                    ordinary meanings said to be defamatory will suffice to illustrate the alleged
                    stings. To be clear, these stings or defamatory meanings are based on the
                    particular words and statements contained in the emails and which were also set
                    out in the Statement of Claim. The alleged defamatory stings include, for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     On the whole, while I do not agree with every
                    single imputation of defamatory meaning as alleged (such as the imputation of
                    illegal fund raising for Mercy Relief), I am of the view that there is some
                    merit to the Plaintiffs’ argument that the contents of the chain of emails
                    are defamatory in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As briefly alluded to above, the test for
                    determining the natural and ordinary meaning of allegedly defamatory words is
                    the meaning that the words would "convey to an ordinary reasonable person, not
                    unduly suspicious or avid for scandal, using his general knowledge and common
                    sense" (see <em>Review Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien
                        Loong</em> [2010] 1 SLR 52 at [27]). It is also important to note that
                    the chain of emails was published primarily to Mr Udairam and Hassan, and
                    therefore, their interpretation of Roy’s email would continue to develop
                    with each email they received. I therefore considered the chain of emails
                    together. (I considered those sent to Mr Udairam and those sent to Hassan
                    separately.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Reading the chain of emails both individually
                    and together, they strongly suggest that the Plaintiffs, at the very least, are
                    guilty of some misconduct in dealing with either the Defendants or Mercy Relief.
                    This is especially so in the context of the donations that the Plaintiffs had
                    provided to Mercy Relief. Throughout the chain of emails, it is clear to me that
                    Roy is insinuating some form of malfeasance on the part of the Plaintiffs. The
                    contents of the chain of emails, as well as the tone used, generally seek to
                    question the Plaintiffs’ actions and their honesty. I state a few example
                    statements in the chain of emails which, in my judgment, bear some defamatory
                    meaning:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Read individually and in the context of the
                    whole chain of emails and the situation that was occurring, I am of the view
                    that the contents of the emails are defamatory in nature. It is also not
                    disputed that the elements of reference to the Plaintiffs and publication are
                    also met.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Short Message Service (“SMS”) texts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On 5 October 2012, Roy sent three SMS texts to
                    Francis stating the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear francis, I just wanted to inform you that, I reported tedric ling to
                        the police A few months ago. Did u know abt it? Roy soeigiarto</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Francis, can we meet for coffee? Btw tedric aka Golden Season wants to get
                        $300k from me for defamation. U know abt that? Roy</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I only ask of you to be truthful and not be afraid. Come what may, the
                        truth will be out abt Tedric and the way he do his business. I am sorry that
                        you are involved. You know better, I wish it does not have to be this way
                        and I also do not wish to be this way as I was dragged into this! Just
                        wanted to affirm you to trust your hear. Tks for the reply. Roy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Reading the third SMS on its own, I am of the
                    view that the third SMS is not defamatory in nature. While, to a certain extent,
                    the phrase, “the truth will be out [about] Tedric and the way he do his
                    business” might suggest that Tedric is conducting his business in an
                    improper or illegal manner, I am not ready to find that the ordinary reader will
                    conclusively draw this meaning from this phrase alone. The phrase could just as
                    well mean that Tedric is a hard or aggressive businessman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     However, the first SMS, which states that a
                    police report had been made against Tedric, is slightly trickier. Leaving aside
                    the fact that Roy had indeed made a police report, the question is whether an
                    ordinary reader would infer from the ordinary meaning of these words that Tedric
                    had conducted his business in an illegal manner or that he had threatened some
                    harm against Roy. On its own, I am of the view that the ordinary reader would
                    not infer from the first SMS that harm had been threatened against Roy. This can
                    be compared, for example, with Email 1 where Roy stated in no uncertain terms
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…for the safety of my family and the good name that we have built,
                        I have made a police report a few hours ago. I have not slept till now as
                        the statement took a while.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The position, however, may be different if
                    these three SMS texts are viewed as a whole. Whether or not the statement in the
                    first SMS that he had made a police report against Tedric is defamatory depends
                    on how the statement would be perceived by an ordinary person in the position of
                    Francis. It is clear that ordinarily a statement that X is under investigation
                    does not imply that X is guilty of an offence. As stated in <em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> (Alastair Mullis &amp; Richard
                    Parkes eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) (“<em>Gatley 2013</em>”) at para 3.28, if the law was
                    otherwise, it would be almost impossible to give accurate information about
                    anything.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Where the statement means nothing more than
                    the fact that there is an investigation or that a complaint has been made, a
                    serious question must arise as to whether the statement is defamatory. Indeed,
                    even if it is defamatory, the statement may be justified by showing that an
                    investigation is being conducted or that a complaint had indeed been made. The
                    question in many cases is whether the ordinary reader would understand the words
                    as meaning more: namely that X is guilty or that there is some reasonable basis
                    for suspecting that an illegality or offence has been committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     It is also stated in <em>Gatley
                        2013</em> at para 2.28 that “it may be defamatory to say that
                    someone is suspected of an offence even where that does not imply guilt”.
                    Much will depend on the context in which the statement was made and how the
                    statement will be perceived by an ordinary reader. Is there an implication that
                    there is a reasonable basis for the investigation or suspicion? If so, subject
                    to defences, liability for defamation arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     For example, in <em>De Souza
                        Tay &amp; Goh (suing as a firm) v Singapore Press Holdings Ltd and another
                        suit</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 201, an article was published in The Straits
                    Times about a company that was being investigated by the United States
                    Securities and Exchange Commission. The article took up almost a third of an
                    entire page and comprised words and graphics. The words included “But a
                    cloud has been cast over this with launch of a probe into the recent surge in
                    its Asia sales by the US Securities and Exchange Commission” and
                    “… possibility that [the company’s] fast sales growth may
                    not be all that it appears”. Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) added at
                    [24] that these statements had to be read in the context of the emphasis in the
                    article that two individuals who were shareholders of the company’s
                    licensees had acted as directors for 678 companies, many of which appeared to be
                    shell companies and that the same two individuals were linked to 15 companies
                    with the same address and which had paid US$57 million to the company for
                    software licences. In this context, Lee Seiu Kin JC found that the ordinary,
                    reasonable reader would interpret the article to mean that the company had used
                    these companies to manipulate financial transactions to create the impression of
                    a high turnover in 1999 and were guilty of fraudulent conduct. At the very least
                    it was found that the article bore the defamatory meaning that there were
                    reasonable grounds to suspect fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In the present case, looking at the first SMS
                    on its own, I am not satisfied that the ordinary, reasonable reader (in the
                    position of Francis) would conclude that that there were reasonable grounds to
                    suspect Tedric to be guilty of an offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The issue is whether the three SMS texts
                    should be treated as separate and distinct messages or as part of single chain
                    of communication to be read as a whole. On the evidence, it appears that the
                    messages were sent at or about the same time and were essentially part of a
                    single communication to Francis. Any reader in the position of Francis would be
                    well aware of the business dispute between Tedric and Roy. On balance I am not
                    satisfied that the three SMS texts, even when read as a whole is defamatory. The
                    statement that a police report had been made was followed by the message that a
                    defamation suit had been brought by Tedric for “300K”. This was
                    followed by the request that Francis “be truthful and not be
                    afraid” and that “come what may, the truth will be out abt Tedric
                    and the way he do his business.” The SMS messages as a whole conveys to
                    the ordinary, reasonable reader that a serious legal dispute between Tedric and
                    Roy had arisen out of business dealings. This meaning is not defamatory without
                    any more. The SMS messages do not necessarily bear the meaning that Tedric is
                    guilty of an offence or that there are good grounds to think that an offence had
                    been committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the defamatory articles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In summary, I find that the elements of the
                    tort of defamation has been established by the Plaintiffs for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Second Facebook Post;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a>(b)     the chain of
                        emails sent to Mr Udairam and Hassan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Can the Defendants rely on the defences of justification, qualified
                privilege or fair comment? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I now turn to examine whether the Defendants
                    can rely on any of the established defences in order to absolve them of
                    liability. I start first with a brief review of the principles of law applicable
                    to the defences, before applying it to the facts at hand. The law concerning the
                    defences available to a defendant in a defamation action is not contentious, and
                    in summary, I find that the Defendants can rely on the defence of fair comment
                    for the Second Facebook Post but not on any defence for the chain of
                    emails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Justification</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     It is an absolute defence in a civil
                    defamation claim that the defamatory imputation is true or substantially true
                    – something that is substantially true cannot be used by the claimant to
                    recover damages (see Littledale J's observations in <em>M'Pherson
                        v Daniels</em> (1829) 10 B &amp; C 263 at 272, as cited by the High
                    Court in <em>Hady Hartanto v Yee Kit Hong and others</em>
                    [2014] 2 SLR 1127 (“<em>Hady Hartanto</em>”)
                    at [127]). A defamatory imputation is presumed to be false, and the burden of
                    proof falls upon the defendant to plead and show that it is true. It is
                    important to note that the meaning that must be proven true must be that which
                    the relevant statement is held to bear, and the defence will not succeed if a
                    materially less serious meaning is proved to be true. It is the imputation
                    contained in the words which has to be justified, not the literal truth of the
                    word (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Chan Cheng
                        Wah</em> at [43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The defendant need only prove the "sting" of
                    the charge, and some leeway for exaggeration and error is given. The Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Chan Cheng Wah</em> (at [44]­) accepted the
                    following position laid down by Burrough J in <em>Edwards v
                        Bell</em> (1824) 1 Bing 403, who stated at 409 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…it is sufficient if the substance of the libellous statement be
                        justified; it is unnecessary to repeat every word which might have been the
                        subject of the original comment. As much must be justified as meets the
                        sting of the charge, and if anything be contained in a charge which does not
                        add to the sting of it, that need not be justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The basis of the defence of justification is
                    truth, and therefore, for this defence, the state of mind of the publisher is
                    not relevant. This means that a defendant can succeed in such a defence even
                    when he publishes the defamatory article believing it to be false, for no amount
                    of malice, bad faith or belief in the falsity of the statement will make it
                    actionable when the allegation is true (see <em>Carter-Ruck on
                        Libel and Privacy</em> (Alastair Mullis &amp; Cameron Doley gen eds)
                    (Lexis Nexis, 6th Ed, 2010) at para 9.1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Qualified privilege</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In <em>Chan Cheng
                        Wah</em>, the Court of Appeal (at [86]) accepted the following
                    explanation of the defence of qualified privilege as found in <em>Gatley</em> at para 14.1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are circumstances in which, on grounds of public policy and
                        convenience, less compelling than those which give rise to absolute
                        privilege, a person may yet, without incurring liability for defamation,
                        make statements of fact about another which are defamatory and in fact
                        untrue. These are cases of qualified privilege ... For a very long time
                        these cases primarily concerned communications of a “private”
                        nature, commonly arising out of the necessities of some existing
                        relationship between the maker of the statement and the recipient.
                        Protection was granted if the statement was “fairly warranted by the
                        occasion” (that is to say, fell within the scope of the purpose for
                        which the law grants the privilege) and so long as it was not shown by the
                        person defamed that the statement was made with malice, i.e. with some
                        indirect or improper motive, which was typically established by proof that
                        the defendant knew the statement to be untrue, or was recklessly indifferent
                        as to its truth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     A defendant can rely on the defence of
                    qualified privilege when it can be shown that the defendant has an interest or
                    duty, whether legal, social or moral, to communicate the information and the
                    recipient has the corresponding interest or duty to receive the information. In
                    this sense, the defence attaches itself to the <em>occasion</em>. As stated by Lord Atkinson in <em>Adam
                        v Ward</em> [1917] AC 309 at 334 (“<em>Adam v
                        Ward</em>”), the <em>reciprocity</em> of
                    duty (between the communicator of the defamatory article and the recipient) is
                    essential. It is the existence, <em>in fact</em>, of this
                    duty or interest, not merely the defendant's belief in its existence, which is
                    relevant to the question whether the occasion was or was not
                privileged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     This approach is succinctly summarised in
                        <em>Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty
                        Ltd</em> (2004) 204 ALR 193, where at [63] it was stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the court must consider all the circumstances and ask
                            whether <em>this</em> publisher had a
                        duty to publish or an interest in publishing <em>this</em> defamatory communication to <em>this</em> recipient. It does not ask whether the
                        communication is for the common convenience and welfare of society. It does
                        not, for example, ask whether it is for the common convenience and welfare
                        of society to report that an employee has a criminal conviction. Instead, it
                        asks whether this publisher had a duty to inform this recipient that the
                        latter's employee had been convicted of a particular offence and whether
                        this recipient had an interest in receiving this information. That will
                        depend on all the circumstances of the case. Depending on those
                        circumstances, for example, there may be no corresponding duty and interest
                        where the conviction occurred many years ago or where it could not possibly
                        affect the employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The defence protects a wide range of
                    interests. In general, the law does not restrict the interests which the
                    defendant may protect by reference to qualified privilege. Statements made in
                    the protection or furtherance of a private interest are also covered (see for
                    example <em>Hytech Builders Pte Ltd v Goh Teng Poh
                        Karen</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 236 (“<em>Hytech
                        Builders</em>”). In the majority of the cases, the interests
                    protected have been business interests. As can be seen, it is important that the
                    communicator believes that the communication is true. There must also be no
                    malice on the part of the defendant. As stated in <em>The Law of
                        Torts in Singapore</em> at para 13.069, “where the Defendant
                    makes a statement with a view to protecting his or her self-interests, such
                    statements are privileged to the extent that they are published <em>bona fide</em> and are relevant and necessary for protecting
                    such interests.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Malice is generally proven in two ways. The
                    first is where it can be shown that the defendant had knowledge of falsity or
                    where there was recklessness or lack of belief in the defamatory statement. The
                    second is where although the defendant may have a genuine or honest belief in
                    the truth of the defamatory statement his <em>dominant</em>
                    intention is to injure the plaintiff or some other improper motive. As explained
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei
                        and another and another appeal</em> [2010] 4 SLR 331 at [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…  The dominant motive test has no relevance if the defendant
                        has no honest belief in the truth of what he is publishing. The fact that
                        the defendant did not have a dominant motive of injuring the plaintiff did
                        not necessarily mean that the publication of the defamatory statements was
                        not made with malice. The word 'malice' is used in a special sense in the
                        law of defamation. If a defendant knows that what he is publishing is false,
                        there is express malice in law. In the other parts of his speech, Lord
                        Diplock referred to other instances of improper motives which would destroy
                        the privilege, such as personal spite or the abuse of the occasion to obtain
                        some private advantage unconnected with the duty or the interest which
                        constitutes the reason for the privilege. In such instances, the defendant
                        would lose the benefit of the privilege <em>despite his
                            positive belief that what he said or wrote was true</em>. Where
                        the defendant had no belief that what he published was true or, worse, if he
                        knew that what he published was untrue (as in the present case), it would
                        have been an a fortiori case that the protection of the privilege
                        would have been lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Fair comment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In order to rely on the defence of fair
                    comment, the defendant must prove four elements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     the words complained of are
                        comments, though they may consist of or include inference[s] of
                        facts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        comment is on a matter of public interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     the comment is based on facts;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_d"></a>(d)     the comment is
                        one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts
                    proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>See <em>Review Publishing</em> at [139],
                    citing with approval <em>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Goh Chok
                        Tong</em> [1983-1984] SLR(R) 745 at [18] and <em>Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Wright Norman</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R)
                    410 at [24]. I note in passing that the defence of fair comment is also defeated
                    by malice. Malice in this context requires proof that the defendant did not
                    genuinely believe what he has stated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     As identified in <em>Review
                        Publishing</em>, the challenge is to distinguish a comment from a
                    statement of fact, as the defence only applies to comments and not imputations
                    of facts. The Court of Appeal in <em>Review Publishing</em>
                    (at [140]) cited with approval the following passage from Doris Chia &amp;
                    Rueben Mathiavaranam, <em>Evans on Defamation in Singapore and
                        Malaysia</em> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2008) ("<em>Evans on
                        Defamation</em>") at p 103, where the learned authors state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It will often be very difficult to decide whether a given statement
                        expresses a comment or [an] opinion, or by contrast constitutes an
                        allegation of fact. The same words published in one context may be
                        statement[s] of fact, yet in another may be comment[s]. Therefore,
                        whether this element of the defence is established is one of fact, dependent
                        upon the nature of the imputation conveyed, and the context and
                        circumstances in which it is published. The test in deciding whether the
                        words are fact or comment is an objective one - namely, whether an ordinary,
                        reasonable reader on reading the whole article would understand the words as
                        comment[s] or [as] statements of fact. The statement must be recognisable as
                        [a] comment by the ordinary, reasonable and fair-minded reader having regard
                        to the whole context of the publication. When such a reader cannot
                        readily distinguish whether the defendant is stating a fact or making a
                        comment, then the proper approach will be to deny the defendant the benefit
                        of the defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     It should be borne in mind that the burden
                    lies on the defendant to distinguish clearly between his statements which are
                    his comments as opposed to allegations of facts. If the defendant fails to
                    distinguish clearly between statements of facts and comments, then the
                    statements may not attract the defence of fair comment. As explained by Fletcher
                    Moulton LJ in <em>Hunt v The Star Newspaper Co Ltd</em>
                    [1908] 2 KB 309 ("Hunt") at 319-320:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law as to fair comment, so far as is material to the present
                        case, stands as follows: In the first place, comment in order to be
                        justifiable as fair comment must appear as comment and must
                        not be so mixed up with the facts that the reader cannot distinguish between
                        what is report and what is comment ... The justice of this rule is obvious.
                        If the facts are stated separately and the comment appears as an inference
                        drawn from those facts, any injustice that it might do will be to some
                        extent negatived by the reader seeing the grounds upon which the
                        unfavourable inference is based. <em>But if fact and
                            comment be intermingled so that it is not reasonably clear what portion
                            purports to be inference, he will naturally suppose that the injurious
                            statements are based on adequate grounds known to the writer though not
                            necessarily set out by him.</em> In the one case the insufficiency
                        of the facts to support the inference will lead fair-minded men to reject
                        the inference. In the other case it merely points to the existence of
                        extrinsic facts which the writer considers to warrant the language he uses.
                        ... Any matter, therefore, which does not indicate with a reasonable
                        clearness that it purports to be comment, and not [a] statement of fact,
                        cannot be protected by the plea of fair comment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As helpfully suggested by the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Review Publishing</em>, a comment has been said to
                    be "something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction,
                    inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark, observance,
                etc."</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Second Facebook Post</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The defence pleaded by the Defendant for the
                    two Facebook posts is that of justification and fair comment. It is explained in
                        <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> at para 13.012
                    that “the underlying rationale for the defence of fair comment is the
                    right of free speech and promotion of open discussion.” The discussion
                    must, however, be on a matter of public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Turning first to fair comment, in posting the
                    Facebook posts, it was asserted that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Roy was expressing his own sincerely-held views about the manner in which

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As mentioned above, it must be shown that the
                    Second Facebook Post is one of comment, rather than of an allegation of fact. To
                    that end, I found the following passage as pertinently noted in Geoffrey
                    Robertson &amp; Andrew Nicol, <em>Robertson &amp; Nicol on Media
                        Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2002) at p 120
                    instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fair comment defence relates only to <em>comment</em> - to statements of opinion and not to statements of
                        fact. This is the most important, and most difficult, distinction in the
                        entire law of libel. ... Writers can help to characterise their
                        criticisms as comment with phrases like “it seems to me”,
                        “in my judgment”, “in other words”, etc.,
                        although such devices will not always be conclusive. ... <em>Where a defamatory remark is made baldly, without reference to any fact
                            from which the remark could be inferred, it is not likely to be
                            defensible as comment, especially if it imputes dishonesty or
                            dishonourable conduct.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    At the end of the day, a common sense
                    approach must be taken in determining whether or not something is a comment.
                    Much will depend on the context, and the court must consider how the statement
                    would strike the ordinary reasonable reader, <em>ie</em>
                    whether it would be recognisable by the ordinary reader as a comment or a
                    statement of fact – see <em>Hytech Builders</em> at
                    [18]. Having all this in mind, in my judgment, I find that the Defendants can
                    rely on the defence of fair comment. As much as the Defendants’ Second
                    Facebook Post was suggestive of the Plaintiffs engaging in some form of business
                    malpractice, that being the sting of the defamatory publication (as found in
                    [43]), I am of the view that the post would be interpreted as Roy expressing his
                    concerns as to what he thought might have gone wrong. Roy had stated (see above
                    at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We support NGOs and gave them huge discounts and donations. We hope that
                        they will aknowledge [<em>sic</em>] and not be sold or
                        passed off as other supplier’s items at prices we do not know.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We [<em>sic</em>] supplied through a 3rd party giving
                        them a huge corporate discount and we hope it was not resold to them
                        instead. That’s our concern.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    While there is some difficulty interpreting
                    whether this should be considered as a statement of fact or opinion
                    (understandably so, as acknowledged by the authorities discussed above), the use
                    of the words “hope” and the phrase “that’s our
                    concern” demonstrate that this was Roy’s interpretation of what was
                    going on, rather than to expressly allege a fact. In this manner, I am prepared
                    to find that these were statements of comments rather than statements of
                    fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I am also of the view that these comments
                    were premised on facts such that a fair-minded person could have honestly made
                    the comments. It must be remembered that Roy had emailed Mercy Relief on 29
                    November 2011 and sought an acknowledgment of the Donated Kairos Items, as well
                    as the discounts that the Defendants had given the Plaintiffs. The Defendants
                    never received a response to this letter until sometime during mid-December
                    2011. Just prior to this, Roy had also received a number of queries from the
                    Plaintiffs questioning him on his contact with the SRC. In the context of the
                    situation, it is my judgment that Roy’s comments attracted the defence of
                    fair comment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It is, therefore, not necessary to consider
                    the defence of justification. Nevertheless for the sake of completeness, to the
                    extent that the Second Facebook Post sets out defamatory statements of fact, I
                    am not satisfied that the defence of justification has been made out. In
                    particular, aside from copyright infringement in respect of certain photographs
                    and brochures belonging to the Defendants, there is no proof that the Plaintiffs
                    have engaged in any criminal or illegal business activity. As will be discussed
                    later, whilst I have found that copyright in some photographs and brochures were
                    infringed, no passing off has been committed by the Plaintiffs. The fact that
                    the Plaintiffs committed some incidental acts of copyright infringement in
                    respect of these works does not support or justify the conclusion that the
                    Plaintiffs are guilty of wider business malpractice. To be clear, there is no
                    doubt on the evidence that the 18 boats obtained by the Plaintiffs and supplied
                    to Mercy Relief for flood relief use in Thailand were indeed donated without
                    payment from Mercy Relief. There is also no doubting that Mercy Relief was aware
                    that another two used boats had been donated by Roy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The email chain</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The primary defence the Defendants rely on
                    for the email chain is the defence of qualified privilege.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> To
                    this end, it was asserted that Roy had a legitimate interest in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a"></a>(a)     seeking clarification as to whether
                        Mercy Relief regarded Kairos as having donated two boats, and whether Golden
                        Season received any consideration for the boats that were supposedly donated
                        by it;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b"></a>(b)     expressing his view, as a donor to Mercy Relief, on the propriety of Golden
                        Season wearing the hats of both fundraiser and supplier;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_c"></a>(c)     expressing his view that Golden
                        Season had passed off the boats purchased from Kairos as the boats of Golden
                        Season;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_d"></a>(d)     expressing his concerns about Mercy Relief, given the development of the
                        communication between him and Mercy Relief, the relationship Tedric shared
                        with Hassan, and Hassan’s previous conviction; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_e"></a>(e)     alerting Mercy Relief that Golden
                        Season (and/or Tedric) had used Mercy Relief’s photographs illegally
                        in breach of Mercy Relief’s copyright.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In order to rely on the defence of qualified
                    privilege, Roy must be able to prove that he has a <em>legitimate</em> interest in communicating this information to Mercy
                    Relief, and likewise, Mercy Relief must have a corresponding interest or duty to
                    receive it. It is generally accepted that some leeway will be given in
                    discerning what is a <em>legitimate</em> interest and the
                    recipient’s duty or interest to receive the information. Eventually, the
                    ultimate question is whether the disputed words were "fairly warranted by the
                    occasion" (see <em>Hady Hartanto</em> at [174]). The legal
                    question is, therefore, whether Roy had a duty or interest in communicating the
                    contents of the chain of emails to Mercy Relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Considering all the circumstances of the
                    case, I find that Roy did have a legitimate interest to communicate, and
                    likewise, Mercy Relief did have a corresponding interest to receive the
                    information on matters pertaining to the two Kairos boats that Roy had donated
                    and the matter of the discounts that the Defendants gave to Golden Season but
                    which he thought might not have been extended to Mercy Relief. It must be
                    remembered that the two Kairos boats were donations to a charitable
                    organisation. If there was any reason to suspect that the donation was misused
                    or did not make it to the intended charity, it would be reasonable to expect the
                    donor to inquire and set out his suspicions as to what happened to the
                    donations. As the donor of the items, Roy had a right to know what happened to
                    his goods and whether or not Mercy Relief had received them. In that manner, I
                    also find that Roy had the interest to know whether Kairos was being
                    acknowledged for these donations. The confusion caused by the replies as found
                    in the chain of emails is perhaps more understandable given that Mercy Relief
                    had already acknowledged the Defendants’ contributions in a letter dated
                    21 October 2011. This letter was sent to the Plaintiffs, but never made its way
                    to the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Despite this, I find that the Defendants
                    cannot rely on the defence of qualified privilege because of malice. As stated
                    above, malice is generally proven in two ways – first, where the defendant
                    had knowledge of falsity, recklessness, or lack of belief in the defamatory
                    statement, and second, where the defendant’s <em>dominant</em> intention is to injure the plaintiff or some other
                    improper motive. At the end of the day, malice in the latter sense is a matter
                    of intention, which can only be discerned from the actions of the Defendants. To
                    this end, three observations can be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    First, while Roy had a legitimate interest
                    to pursue the above two mentioned matters, the contents of the chain of emails
                    clearly set out extraneous matters above and on top of Roy’s legitimate
                    interest. To this end, the introduction of extraneous matter which falls outside
                    of this legitimate interest can be evidence of malice on the part of the
                    Defendants. As mentioned in <em>Adam v Ward</em> at
                    318:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Such malice may be inferred either from the terms of the communication
                        itself, as if the language be unnecessarily strong, or from any facts which
                        show that the defendant in publishing the libel was actuated by spite or
                        some indirect motive. The privilege extends only to a communication upon the
                        subject with respect to which privilege exists, and it does not extend to a
                        communication upon any other extraneous matter which the defendant may have
                        made at the same time. <em>The introduction of such
                            extraneous matter may afford evidence of malice which will take away
                            protection on the subject to which privilege attaches</em>, and
                        the communication on the extraneous matter is not made upon a privileged
                        occasion at all, inasmuch as the existence of privilege on one matter gives
                        no protection to irrelevant libels introduced into the same
                        communication.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    While I have some sympathy for Roy given the
                    relatively slow responses given by Mercy Relief, I find that it was unnecessary
                    for Roy to have included statements which went clearly beyond these two matters.
                    This included for example, the insinuation that Roy’s family was in danger
                    and that he had to report the matter to the police for the safety of his family,
                    and that all “proofs” were in the possession of Roy’s elders
                    and advisors for safe keeping. This, as Roy himself had admitted, was clearly
                    not the case as the Plaintiffs had not conducted themselves in anyway where
                    there could have been a reasonable apprehension of danger.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Second, I also considered the tone and the
                    language of the emails. Exceptionally strong language can reveal an intention to
                    convey a certain message that may not be expressly stated. In the emails, Roy
                    had chosen to use phrases such as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_a"></a>(a)     “due to his
                            ethics”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_b"></a>(b)     “Please be warned that

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_c"></a>(c)     “This is a breach of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_d"></a>(d)     “What would a member of the public think if this

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_e"></a>(e)     “I also serve in a few committees and serve my

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_f"></a>(f)     “But what was mentioned by Golden

                        police and COC if MR have been mislead”; and<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_h"></a>(h)     “I trust that this official email be kept to this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I contrasted this to the case of <em>Hytech Builders</em>. In that case, the alleged defamatory
                    statement was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have checked around in the industry and I am alarmed to learn
                        that Hytech Builders is on the verge of collapse as a
                        company!</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This statement appeared in an email sent by a home owner to the
                    developer, expressing her concerns that the contractor, Hytech Builders, was on
                    the brink of bankruptcy. The language employed by the defendant in <em>Hytech Builders</em> can be strongly contrasted with the
                    language used in this case. In my opinion, Roy’s choice of words and
                    language indicated that the purpose of these emails went beyond expressing his
                    grievances, confusion, or even suspicions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Finally, while Roy had a legitimate interest
                    to pursue these two matters, I found it significant that Roy <em>did not contact the Plaintiffs</em> to clarify these matters. After
                    the heated exchange of emails between Roy and the Plaintiffs where the
                    Plaintiffs had told the Defendants not to contact the Plaintiffs’ clients
                    directly, Roy effectively stopped communicating with the Plaintiffs - the last
                    email being sent on 22 November 2011. Roy then chose to directly communicate his
                    suspicions to Mercy Relief through a barrage of emails. In fact, a number of
                    these suspicions could have easily been verified if the parties had simply
                    communicated with each other. For example, the Defendants’ allegation that
                    the Plaintiffs had breached Mercy Relief’s copyright in using their
                    photographs would have been verified to be untrue. In a letter from Mercy
                    Relief’s solicitors to the Defendants’ solicitors, Hassan clarified
                    that permission had been sought for the Plaintiffs to use their photographs on
                    its website.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Apart from the Facebook posts, Roy also went
                    on to file a police report and a commissioner of charities report. Even without
                    considering the veracity of the content of the reports, I find that these
                    actions, considered cumulatively, speak of some malicious intent on the part of
                    the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Considering these three points, I am of the
                    view that the Defendants were motivated by some malicious intent in writing
                    these emails to Mercy Relief. It may very well have been the case that certain
                    information should have been conveyed to Roy much earlier by Mercy Relief and
                    that Roy found himself in a perplexing and confusing situation over the
                    donations, especially in light of miscommunications leading to Roy taking an
                    inaccurate perspective of the whole situation. Be that as it may, while it is
                    understandable why Roy felt aggrieved and had to express his frustration at the
                    situation, the law does not condone those who seek to defame others as an outlet
                    for their frustration. It is a matter of perspective – what was the whole
                    point of the communication of the defamatory material?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In this case, I find that the objective of
                    the email was not to highlight the two matters which were of legitimate interest
                    to Roy, which would have caused the Plaintiffs to be defamed incidentally.
                    Instead, the point of the emails was to defame the Plaintiffs, and the two
                    matters of legitimate interest, in addition to extraneous material were
                    included, and were used as examples to support the point. Although not
                    conclusive, an added layer of circumspection was appropriate given that the
                    Defendants were essentially competing with the Plaintiffs in the area of
                    inflatable boats and disaster relief during this period of time when these
                    emails were being exchanged. I, therefore, find that the Defendants cannot rely
                    on the defence of qualified privilege for the chain of emails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    For completeness, whether or not the defence
                    of justification applies (to one particular sting) depends on whether the
                    Plaintiffs have infringed upon the copyright of the Defendants. As will be seen
                    below, the claim for copyright infringement succeeds but not the claim for
                    passing off. Apart from this issue, it is clear that the defence of
                    justification cannot apply to the matter of discounts and reselling of the boats
                    from the Plaintiffs to Mercy Relief – the boats were indeed donated to
                    Mercy Relief. To the extent that allegations were also made of conflict of
                    interest, improper fund raising <em>etc</em>., I am not
                    satisfied that the facts before me go anywhere close to establishing the
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Damages for defamation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I find the Defendants liable for defamation
                    for the chain of emails sent to Mercy Relief, and now move on to consider the
                    quantum of damages that should be awarded to the Plaintiffs. Before doing so,
                    however, some clarification needs to be made as to exactly who has been defamed.
                    For ease of reference, the above analysis had generally considered the
                    Plaintiffs collectively, <em>ie</em>, Tedric, Golden Season
                    and Designer.SG together. However, for the purposes of damages, especially in
                    considering whether aggravated or exemplary damages should be awarded, it is
                    necessary to consider whether it is one or all of the Plaintiffs that have been
                    defamed. This is critical because corporations, unlike individuals, are not able
                    to rely on “injured feelings and hurt” as a kind of damage
                    suffered. Aggravated damages are usually awarded to compensate such
                    losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Who has been defamed?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The answer to the question above must be
                    derived from the plain ordinary reading of the defamatory material by a
                    reasonable man. At the very least, it is clear that the Third Plaintiff, Tedric,
                    has been defamed. The chain of emails constantly refers to Tedric and the emails
                    are worded such that it is suggested that Tedric is in control of the First
                    Plaintiff, Golden Season, as well as the Second Plaintiff, Designer.SG, and that
                    he has been the mastermind behind the whole incident. Although both Golden
                    Season and Designer.SG have been mentioned in the emails, the thrust of the
                    emails and in fact, the defamatory “sting” of the email appears to
                    be centred on how Tedric has allegedly cheated both Mercy Relief and the
                    Defendants in his dealings with them. It is also apparent that these allegations
                    arose in the context of Tedric being the “Entrepreneur from
                    Designer.SG” and “the Marketing Director of Golden
                    Season”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The question before me therefore, is whether
                    as a result of this, the First and Second Plaintiff are also defamed. Taking a
                    plain and ordinary reading of the defamatory material, would the defamatory
                    sting reasonably refer to Golden Season and Designer.SG?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The point has been made earlier that it is
                    necessary that the defamatory words are understood as referring to the
                    Plaintiffs. It follows that a company will not be able to maintain an action for
                    defamation if the defamatory words refer to the officers or members of a company
                    and not the company. The case of <em>Duke v University of
                        Salford</em> [2013] EWHC 196 (QB) is illustrative. The defendant had
                    published a blog whereby members of the public or students of the plaintiff
                    university were encouraged to make contributions to an ongoing discussion either
                    anonymously or by way of pseudonyms. One of the main functions of the blog was
                    to provide a platform for criticism of various aspects of the University's
                    administration. Two individuals of the university administration were often
                    singled out. The defendant applied to have the action struck out. The
                    application was dismissed. He appealed, maintaining that the defamatory words as
                    found in the blog were not in reference to the university, but to certain
                    individuals, and therefore, the university could not maintain the action. The
                    appeal was allowed, and the action struck out, the court finding that “in
                    substance and reality, this [was] an action about allegations against
                    individuals rather than against the University itself”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    That is not to say that a company cannot be
                    defamed when its officers have been defamed. Much will depend on exactly what
                    the officer was defamed of. As stated at para 8.17 of <em>Gatley:</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To take an extreme case, a trading company could clearly have no action in
                        respect of a statement imputing sexual promiscuity to its managing director
                        or alleging that he had murdered his wife. Where the imputation concerns a
                        “business” matter more difficult questions of degree will
                        arise but the extent to which the person directly defamed controls the
                        company and can therefore be regarded as its <em>alter
                            ego</em> will be a relevant consideration. [Emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    This is also reflected in the decision of
                        <em>Bargold Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd &amp;
                        Anor</em> [1981] 1 NSWLR 9, where Hunt J at 10 said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… where such matter reflects solely upon a director or an officer
                        of a company, the company itself cannot complain of its publication, but the
                        emphasis must be placed upon the word ‘solely’: <em>Bognor Regis Urban District Council v
                        Campion</em> [1972] 2 QB 169 at p. 175.  However,
                        an imputation concerning such a director or officer may in many cases
                        reflect also upon the company itself; whether it may or does must depend
                        upon the part that director or officer is alleged to have played in the
                        operations of the company and upon the extent to which the one is identified
                        with or considered to be the alter ego of the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In <em>Hunt Australia Pty Ltd
                        v Davidsons’ Arnhem Land Safaris Pty Ltd</em> (2000) 179 ALR 738
                        (“<em>Hunt Australia</em>”), the Managing
                    Director of the plaintiff company was said to be a liar. The judge at first
                    instance held that the plaintiff company was also defamed by virtue of the fact
                    that the Managing Director was the <em>alter ego</em> of
                    the company – he and his company were so closely linked in the industry
                    that they were identified as one and the same. An attack on the character and
                    integrity of the Managing Director was therefore an attack on the character and
                    integrity of the plaintiff company. On appeal, the court agreed with the
                    findings of the judge at first instance, holding that it was a fair and
                    reasonable reading of the defamatory words, such that the plaintiff company was
                    also defamed. In so holding, the court relied on the decision in <em>Bargold</em>, where Hunt J at 10 said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The article identifies the plaintiff company as being the ‘latest
                        venture’ of Mr Alexander Barton who, it is said, runs the company with
                        his son, Thomas Barton.  A great deal of attention is paid by the
                        article to Mr Alexander Barton personally.  It is argued by the
                        defendants that matter disparaging of Mr Barton is irrelevant to the
                        question of what is disparaging of the plaintiff company.  I
                        accept that where such matter reflects solely upon a director or an officer
                        of a company, the company itself cannot complain of its publication, but the
                        emphasis must be placed upon the word solely … However, an imputation
                        concerning such a director or officer may in many cases reflect also upon
                        the company itself …”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Applying this to the facts before me, I am
                    of the view that the email chain is capable of referring to Tedric as well as
                    Golden Season, but (with a few exceptions) not to Designer.SG. Throughout the
                    emails, it was either expressly mentioned or implied that Tedric was a cheat,
                    had committed a breach of trust, and was dishonest. It is also accepted that
                    Golden Season was the main vehicle through which Tedric had made his purchases
                    from the Defendants and his donations to Mercy Relief and SRC. I am also of the
                    view that Mercy Relief was used to seeing Tedric and Golden Season synonymously,
                    in that they were so commonly associated with each other. This is to be
                    contrasted with Designer.SG, which is a relatively young (new) company and which
                    is hardly mentioned at all in the chain of emails. As a result, I am of the view
                    that Tedric and Golden Season have been defamed by the chain of emails, insofar
                    as the references to the character of Tedric would be imputed onto Golden Season
                    as a company being operated by Tedric. As such, Tedric and Golden Season can
                    claim for damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    For completeness, the Court notes that
                    Designer.SG was mentioned in some of the emails. These include Email 3 which
                    states that Roy thought he had dealt with Tedric of Designer.SG and mentions
                    that some bills had not been paid by Tedric of Designer.SG. Similarly in Email
                    4, it is again stated that Roy thought he was dealing at the outset with Tedric
                    of Designer.SG. The crux of the passing references to Designer.SG is that when
                    Roy first dealt with Tedric his understanding was that Tedric was acting in his
                    position as a director of Designer.SG. It will be recalled that Designer.SG was
                    a new company that was in the home décor business. Golden Season, on the other
                    hand, was a much more established company dealing in military and humanitarian
                    relief products. Tedric was the Sales Director of Golden Season.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    It is clear that Mercy Relief and other
                    charitable organisations dealt with Golden Season for supplies of relief
                    products such as ready to go meals and the like. Even if the statement that
                    Tedric of Designer.SG had outstanding bills with the Defendants is a direct
                    reference to the Second Plaintiff, I am not satisfied that the other imputations
                        (<em>ie</em>, cheating or improper business practices)
                    extend beyond Tedric and Golden Season.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    To be clear, Email 4 states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We will still extend our inflatable products to your NGO at corporate
                        rates directly for future flood disaster relief and will not deal with
                            <em>tedric ling</em> from Designer.Sg as he has
                        also not paid for some of the items still owed to my company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This statement on its own and in the context of the email as a
                    whole is directed at Tedric Ling, the Third Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Email 6 states, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have never mention [<em>sic</em>] that we sold to
                        your organization nor copied from your website. It was given by designer.sg
                        to me by email and yet Tedric did this much later on…. ( was it with
                        your permission ??)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Statement of Claim pleads that Email 6 is defamatory <em>inter alia</em> because it meant that Designer.SG
                    “gave the Defendants permission to use MR photographs in breach of
                    MR’s copyright.” I do not agree that this is the natural inference
                    to be drawn. Email 6 is directed largely at the First Plaintiff and contains the
                    statement that Golden Season should be warned not to use the photographs taken
                    with the Thai Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Email 7 is pleaded as containing <em>inter alia</em> the statement that Tedric had begun his
                    discussions as a representative of his furniture company whereas it is now
                    Golden Season. I do not agree that the implication behind this is that the
                    Second Plaintiff gave the Defendants permission to commit copyright
                    infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Email 8 as pleaded contains <em>inter alia</em> statements essentially to the effect that the
                    Defendants thought Tedric was dealing in his capacity as an officer of
                    Designer.SG and that they will still claim from Designer.SG until they pay up.
                    Email 8 is pleaded as defamatory of Designer.SG in that it means it owes
                    outstanding debts. Other statements are said to be defamatory in that they
                    suggest Designer.SG gave permission to use photographs in breach of Mercy
                    Relief’s copyright. In so far as the sting of debts is concerned, I am of
                    the view that this statement is primarily directed towards Tedric and Golden
                    Season. The same is true of the second sting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In any case, I note in passing that even if
                    there is a defamatory meaning directed at Designer.SG, namely that Designer.SG
                    is not able to meet its debts or that it was experiencing some financial
                    difficulties, there is little evidence that this has resulted in any loss or
                    damage to Designer.SG or that its business reputation has been damaged in any
                    manner. Indeed looking at the few references to Designer.SG and unpaid bills and
                    photographs in the context of the emails as a whole I am not satisfied that the
                    statement would lower the standing of Designer.SG as opposed to
                Tedric.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Quantum of damages </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    I now turn to the quantum of damages that is
                    to be awarded to the First Plaintiff and the Third Plaintiff, Golden Season and
                    Tedric respectively. For ease of reference, I refer to them as the
                    “Plaintiffs” save where necessary to deal with their claims
                    separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Counsel for the Plaintiffs sought to
                    persuade me that damages awarded should not be limited to general damages but
                    should also include aggravated and exemplary damages. General damages in libel
                    actions are meant to vindicate the plaintiff's reputation as well as to afford
                    compensatory redress for injury to the plaintiff's reputation and
                    feelings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    As discussed above, it is clear that a
                    company can claim for general damages for injury caused to its business
                    reputation. Leaving aside claims for consequential damage (loss of business) it
                    has been said that a company is unlikely to be entitled to a really substantial
                    award of damages (see <em>Gatley 2013</em> at para 9.17).
                    Much of course will depend on whether the defamation has injured the business
                    goodwill of the company such that the business reputation of the company can
                    only be vindicated by a “really substantial award”. In many cases,
                    it may be that in the absence of sufficient proof that the company has suffered
                    loss of business the award to the company whilst more than nominal will be
                    “small in commercial terms”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Counsel for the Plaintiffs, however,
                    submitted that a company can claim for aggravated damages, in so far as the
                    position at law was not clear, relying on the decision of the Court of the
                    Appeal in <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security
                        Co-operative Ltd and others</em> [2010] 3 SLR 110, where at [65], it
                    was opined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Only an individual can claim damages for distress. A corporate or business
                        entity can only recover damages appropriate for vindication and (if pleaded)
                        special damages for loss of business and goodwill. We also note that the
                        ability of a corporate plaintiff to recover aggravated damages for
                        defamation has not been authoritatively settled (see, <em>eg</em>, the contrasting positions taken in the English
                        High Court cases of <em>Messenger Newspapers Group Ltd v
                            National Graphical Association </em>[1984] IRLR 397
                            and <em>Collins Stewart v The Financial Times
                            Ltd</em> [2005] EWHC 262).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    I am not persuaded that a corporate entity
                    can or should be awarded aggravated damages. It is common understanding that
                    aggravated damages are awarded for injury to feelings and pride in circumstances
                    where the Defendant’s conduct has aggravated the injury. Aggravated
                    damages in this sense remain compensatory in nature, albeit in the nature of a
                    more generous compensatory award. Even though the conduct of the defendant
                    (exceptional or contumelious behaviour or motive) is an important consideration,
                    the purpose of aggravated damages remains compensation and not punishment.
                    Punishment falls within the domain of exemplary damages (see the English Law
                    Commission's Report on Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages (Law Com
                    No 247, 1997)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    It is hard to see how, on this basis,
                    aggravated damages are applicable to a corporate entity. Whilst the English High
                    Court in <em>Messenger Newspapers Group Ltd v National Graphical
                        Association </em>[19984] 1 All ER 293 (“<em>Messenger Newspapers</em>”) case awarded aggravated damages to
                    a corporate plaintiff, the Court there was more concerned with the need to
                    punish the defendant for his deliberate wrong doing (see also <em>Gatley 2013</em> at para 9.20). On this basis, <em>Messenger Newspapers</em> is really a decision on <em>exemplary</em> damages rather than <em>aggravated</em> damages. Indeed, the court in <em>Messenger Newspapers</em> made clear that the award was not in
                    respect of injury to feelings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In any case, as will be discussed below, in
                    my view the losses suffered by the First Plaintiff can be adequately compensated
                    with an award of general damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In deciding the quantum of damages, the
                    comments of the Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Hsien Loong v
                        Singapore Democratic Party and others and another suit</em> [2009] 1
                    SLR(R) 642 at [72] and [73] are instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72    … Relevant factors would include the gravity
                            of the libel (<em>eg</em>, allegations relating to
                            the integrity or the truthfulness of a plaintiff are amongst the most
                            serious), the extent of the circulation of the libel and any repetition
                            of it. The court has to take into account any mitigating features and
                            any relevant aggravating conduct on the part of the defendant.
                            Retraction or apology, if any, is a matter tending to
                            mitigate damages. Malice of the defendant, in contrast, is an
                            aggravating factor. Also of relevance is the conduct of the plaintiff
                            and his standing in society. Equally, the defendant's conduct of the
                            proceedings and at the trial itself might be a basis for aggravating or
                            increasing the damages awarded to redress the injury to the
                            plaintiff's feelings. In that connection, the court will generally
                            consider the chronology of the entire proceedings so as to see to what
                            extent (if any) the defendant's conduct should impact upon the
                            compensation to be awarded to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73     Lastly, the size of the award has to be an
                        amount that represents a fair and reasonable sum commensurate with or
                        proportionate to the damage which the plaintiff has suffered to his
                        reputation, standing and good name. It will also have to be a sum that
                        sufficiently vindicates his reputation (see <em>Cassell
                            &amp; Co Ltd v Broome </em>[1972] AC 1027 at
                        1071, per Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC). To this end, the
                        court will look at the corpus of past awards for comparison or guidance.
                        Broadly appropriate comparable cases can, if used with discretion, provide
                        some guidance on the appropriate amount of damages to award in a
                        particular case. This approach is especially useful in promoting a
                        rationally sustainable and coherent regime for damages for libel,
                        and, as a corollary, in avoiding "the grossly exorbitant awards so often
                        made by juries in other jurisdictions" (per Thean JA in <em>Tang Liang Hong</em> (CA) ([21] supra) at
                        [158]). Notably, in making that remark, Thean JA was not in any way
                        suggesting that, in adopting this approach, damages should be
                        capped. That would be quite unrealistic, given the factual diversity
                        of defamation cases. But, the fact that
                        the damages awarded in previous cases inevitably depend on the
                        facts and circumstances of each individual case is not a reason for
                        rejecting the use of case precedents as comparables. In other words, the
                        award of damages made in a case comparable to the case at hand is
                        not sacrosanct, but it can hardly be thought to be irrelevant. The
                        impression gathered from a review of the past awards in local cases is that
                        the increase in damages seen in the cases is largely linked to the
                        nature and the number of aggravating factors present in a particular case
                        and, to an extent, the change in the purchasing power of money over the
                        decades.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The factors that can be taken into account
                    are numerous, some of which are touched on in para 9.5 of <em>Gatley 2013</em>, and include:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the conduct of the claimant, his credibility, his position and
                        standing and the subjective impact that the libel has had on him, the nature
                        of the libel, its gravity and the mode and extent of its publication, the
                        absence or refusal of any retraction or apology, and the conduct of the
                        defendant from the time when the libel was published down to the
                        verdict.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Although the email chain is defamatory of
                    the Plaintiffs and, to a certain extent, touched upon the Plaintiffs’
                    honesty (in particular Tedric), it was framed in a very particular context, this
                    being the acquisition of the boats for flood relief and the donation of the two
                    boats (from Kairos) in this specific episode. As for the standing of the
                    Plaintiffs, I note that Tedric has some reputation in the business world in
                    Singapore. I also note that Golden Season is a 30-year old company of some
                    repute, especially given its involvement in charity work. The Plaintiffs have
                    asserted that the email chain was published to a number of other recipients
                    apart from Mercy Relief, given that it was addressed to “friends and
                    clients of Kairos Inflatables”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. However, the Plaintiffs have
                    not produced further evidence to substantiate this, and based on the email
                    subject title alone and my observation of the demeanour of the witnesses, I am
                    not prepared to find that the email chain was sent <em>en
                        masse</em> to a large number of people.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    As found above, I am satisfied, however,
                    that the Second Defendant had malicious intent in writing the chain of emails.
                    That is an aggravating factor to be taken into account when deciding the quantum
                    of damages. Although there may have been some grounds for suspicion and
                    unhappiness over the slow responses he was receiving, the Second Defendant, a
                    mature businessman, had chosen to pursue his suspicions relentlessly without
                    even bothering to communicate or check with the Plaintiffs. I am of the view
                    that his pursuit of the truth was done with the intention of hurting Tedric as
                    one the objectives. At the very least, the emails were sent in a reckless
                    manner. To this extent, I am of the view that the chain of emails indeed bore a
                    semblance of a personal “witch-hunt” by the Second Defendant (see
                        <em>Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor</em> [2001] 1
                    SLR(R) 86 at [48]). I was also not impressed that in raising their defence, the
                    Defendants chose to bring up Hassan’s past, which is, in my view,
                    exceptionally irrelevant for the purposes of this trial. I also note that no
                    apology has been extended by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I took into account the following cases
                    where the award of damages ranged from $20,000 to $80,000 (<em>A
                        Balakrishnan v Nirumalan K Pillay</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 462

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    These cases, while not on all fours with the
                    present case, provided <em>broad</em> guidelines and were
                    useful benchmarks upon which to base the quantum of damages to be awarded (see
                        <em>Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</em>
                    [1998] 2 SLR(R) 971 at [57]). I also considered the principles laid down by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and
                        another and another appeal</em> [2010] 4 SLR 357.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    In the present case, the Third Plaintiff,
                    while a respectable businessman, was not a “public figure”. Also,
                    the extent of publication was low. Not only was the extent of publication low
                    – it was primarily to Mercy Relief as an organisation. Taking all this
                    into consideration and bearing in mind that the award of damages should be
                    commensurate to the damage suffered by a plaintiff, I was of the view that the
                    quantum of damages to be awarded would be largely similar to the awards in the
                    above mentioned cases. I award the First Plaintiff $15,000 for the injury done
                    to its business reputation. In the case of Tedric, the Third Plaintiff, I award
                    him $30,000 by way of general damages for the injury to his reputation and the
                    consequential injury to his feelings and dignity. Considering the presence of
                    malice as well as the manner in which the events unfolded, I further award the
                    Third Plaintiff aggravated damages of $20,000. The total amount of damages
                    awarded to the Plaintiffs is, therefore, $65,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    For completeness, I did not find that an
                    award for exemplary damages was appropriate for this case. Whilst exemplary
                    damages can be awarded, they are only recoverable “where compensatory
                    damages after taking account all the circumstances of aggravation, remain an
                    insufficient punishment” – see <em>Clerk and
                        Lindsell on Torts</em> (Michael A Jones gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    20th Ed, 2010) ("<em>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</em>") at
                    para 22-231. Important factors include proof that the defendant at the time of
                    publication was aware that he was committing the tort (or was acting recklessly)
                    and still proceeded because of his hope of material gain. Whilst the Court
                    accepts that the Defendants were competitors of the Plaintiffs at the time the
                    defamatory emails were sent, I am not satisfied that an award of exemplary
                    damages is justified or necessary to punish the Defendants over and above the
                    award of compensatory and aggravated damages which I have discussed
                    earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Loss of sales </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Counsel for the Plaintiffs argued that

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The above table, based on the statement of
                    accounts to Mercy Relief and the SRC, was said to demonstrate the drop in sales
                    between 2011 and 2012 and between 2011 and 2013. Mercy Relief and the SRC were
                    major clients of Golden Season, and represented up to 25% of their annual sales
                    for certain years. It was submitted that in 2013, orders from Mercy Relief and
                    SRC had come to a “standstill”, and that Golden Season had
                    suffered a loss of approximately $330,000 in total.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    A plaintiff must be compensated by a
                    defendant for a (financial) loss of business resulting from the wrongful
                    commission of a tort. This is simply the law of damages in tort law – the
                    compensation from the defendant is to redress and to right any loss suffered by
                    the plaintiff, and to restore him to the position as if the tort was not
                    committed. Equally so, the normal principles of causation and remoteness apply
                    in deciding what damage the plaintiff is to be compensated for. The damage must
                    flow from the wrongful commission of the tort, and cannot be too remote.
                    Although there is some academic debate as to whether financial loss should fall
                    under “general” or “special” damages, it is largely
                    recognised that this can be claimed by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In this case, based on the evidence before
                    the Court, it does appear that sales from SRC and Mercy Relief reduced/stopped
                    after the Plaintiffs started to get involved in litigation with the Defendants.
                    However, the Plaintiffs must show that it is <em>because of the
                        defamatory publications</em> by the Defendants which have led to the
                    loss of sales. Where a claimant alleges that in consequence of being defamed by
                    the defendant he has suffered special damage, it is always open to the latter to
                    suggest that the damage in question is attributable to other causes (see
                        <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</em> at para 22-236).
                    While there is no need to prove that SRC and Mercy Relief believed that the
                    defamatory publications were true (see <em>Lynch v
                        Knight</em> (1861) 9 HLC 577 and <em>Slipper v
                        BBC</em> [1991] QB 283), it must be proved that it was because the
                    Plaintiffs were defamed, and not because of some other reason, such as economic
                    conditions for example, that a loss or fall in sales occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    To this end, the evidence of SRC and Mercy
                    Relief is critical in understanding exactly <em>why</em>
                    orders had stopped.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> When questioned as to why
                    there were no orders placed with Golden Season, Hassan had answered that they
                    wanted to be more “cautious” and to see “how this case
                    turns out”. Hassan continually stressed that he kept telling Golden
                    Season that he did “not want to be involved in this, and especially that
                    period of time in October/November/December of 2011 and 2012”. According
                    to Hassan, this was a very crucial and critical time for the humanitarian sector
                    in the region. Under cross-examination, Hassan was asked whether the opinion of
                    the Plaintiffs had changed as a result of this episode. In reply, Hassan
                    maintained that he always has been grateful to Golden Season for all the
                    support, but reiterated that he was not appreciative of being “dragged
                    into this whole commercial dispute”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Considering the evidence, I am not convinced
                    that the sales from the SRC and Mercy relief dropped because of the defamatory
                    publications, whether it is because SRC and Mercy Relief believed that they were
                    true, or because they did not want to associate themselves with the Plaintiffs
                    who had been defamed. In my view, the SRC and Mercy Relief had chosen to stop
                    orders from the Plaintiffs because of complications arising from the litigation
                    and the souring of the relationship between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants,
                    one of its former suppliers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    As testified by Hassan, Mercy Relief was
                    reluctant to get involved in the whole affair. It is, therefore, understandable
                    that the organisations might turn to other suppliers for their necessary
                    equipment. To this end, it is also telling that for 2012, Golden Season recorded
                    $457,623.48 of sales from Mercy Relief, which is approximately twice the amount
                    of sales recorded for each of the years from 2008 to 2010. Given that the
                    “defamatory campaign” of the Defendants was from end 2011 to early
                    2012, this further reinforces the assessment that the drop in sales was not
                    attributable to the publication of the defamatory statements. Despite the
                    publications, Mercy Relief still placed orders with Golden Season in 2012. I
                    also note that in 2010, the SRC did not place any orders with Golden Season. Why
                    this was so was not explained. Therefore, without further evidence proving
                    otherwise, I find that the fact that the SRC did not place orders with Golden
                    Season from 2012 and the first half of 2013 cannot be solely attributed to the
                    defamatory publications of the Defendant. Indeed, I note in passing that the
                    evidence on the details as to the sales figures (Tables aside) was rather thin.
                    In this case therefore, I am not prepared to find that the loss in sales were
                    caused by the defamatory publications of the Defendants (namely, the email
                    chain), and therefore, do not award damages for the alleged financial loss
                    suffered by Golden Season.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    In reaching this decision on the claim for
                    loss of sales, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Low
                        Tuck Kwong v Sukamto Sia</em> [2014] 1 SLR 639 (“<em>Sukamto Sia</em>”) was instructive. In that case, VK
                    Rajah JA (as he then was) for the Court of Appeal accepted (at [94]) that as a
                    general proposition, a plaintiff is not precluded from claiming special damages
                    in an action for defamation on top of a claim for general damage. It did not
                    follow, however, that all consequential pecuniary loss was recoverable. The
                    Court of Appeal also pointed out (at [96]) that in defamation cases, the
                    propensity was for the plaintiff to claim damage to reputation: as general
                    damages <em>tout court</em>. This was because a claim for
                    special damages is also limited to a claim in respect of losses referable to the
                    damage to reputation. Further, it was held (at [98]) that where the loss
                    resulting from publication of the words complained of is not referable to the
                    protected interest (reputation), the loss is not claimable even if the
                    publication was factually causative of it. In the present case, the evidence
                    supports the view that Mercy Relief and SRC likely reduced or stopped placement
                    of orders because of the business dispute between the Plaintiffs and Defendants
                    and not because of the defamatory statements <em>per
                        se</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on defamation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    To summarise, I find that the
                    Plaintiffs’ claim in defamation with regards to the email chain succeeds.
                    The First Plaintiff (Golden Season) is awarded $15,000 for the injury done to
                    its business reputation. The Third Plaintiff (Tedric) is awarded $30,000 by way
                    of general damages and $20,000 by way of aggravated damages. The total amount of
                    damages awarded to the Plaintiffs is, therefore, $65,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    For the avoidance of doubt, I note that the
                    defamatory email chain was authored by the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant. It is clear that this was done in his personal capacity <em>and</em> as the director of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. In <em>The Law of
                        Torts in Singapore</em> at [18.014], the point is made that “as
                    an artificial entity, the acts of a corporation are performed by its employees
                    or officers or directors. Acts of such persons may be attributed to the
                    corporation. The act of a person regarded as the directing mind and will of the
                    corporation would generally be regarded as the act of the corporation
                    itself”. In any case, none of the parties have drawn any distinction
                    between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Before moving on to discuss the
                    Defendants’ counterclaim in copyright infringement and passing off, I deal
                    with the Plaintiffs’ parallel claim in malicious falsehood.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Malicious falsehood and s 6(1) of the Defamation Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Apart from the claim in defamation, the
                    Plaintiffs also raised the tort of malicious falsehood and s 6(1) of the
                    Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed) (“DA”). Section 6(1) of the
                    DA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Slander of title,
                        etc.</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>6.</b>—(1)  In any action for slander of title,
                        slander of goods or other malicious falsehood, it shall not be necessary to
                        allege or prove special damage —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) if the words upon which the action
                            is founded are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and
                            are published in writing or other permanent form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Under common law, to succeed in a claim in
                    malicious falsehood, the plaintiff must prove:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_159-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the defendant published to
                        third parties words which are false;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_159-p2_b"></a>(b)     that they refer to the claimant or his property or his
                        business;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_159-p2_c"></a>(c)     that

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_159-p2_d"></a>(d)     that special damage has followed as a direct and natural

                            SLR 727 at [68] approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Sukamto Sia</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The tort of malicious falsehood, while
                    similar to that of defamation, stands as a distinct cause of action on its own.
                    Since I have already found that the Defendants are liable for defamation for the
                    chain of emails, there would be no need to further discuss whether they would
                    succeed under the tort of malicious falsehood since double recovery of damages
                    is not allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    I do not find that the Plaintiffs will
                    succeed under s 6(1) of the DA or the tort of malicious falsehood for either the
                    Facebook posts or the SMS texts to Francis in any event. My reasons are as
                    follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Facebook posts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    As I have found above, the First Facebook
                    Post does not adequately refer to the Plaintiffs. This is a requirement under
                    both the tort of malicious falsehood and s 6(1) of the DA. Although this is not
                    explicitly mentioned under s 6(1) of the DA, the words “calculated to
                    cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff” have been interpreted by the
                    Singapore High Court in <em>DHKW Marketing v Nature's Farm Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 774 at [39] to mean "likely to produce the
                    result" (see also <em>Gatley</em> at para 21.13). This was
                    approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Sukamto Sia</em> at
                    [112], who went on to observe that a similar interpretation was adopted by the
                    Supreme Court of New Zealand in <em>Customglass Boats Ltd v
                        Salthouse Brothers Ltd</em> [1976] RPC 589 at 603, where similar
                    legislation was interpreted. Clearly, if it is “likely” to cause
                    pecuniary damage to the plaintiff, the plaintiff must be sufficiently referred
                    to. This is not the case for the First Facebook Post.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    I had found that the Second Facebook Post
                    was defamatory, but that the defence of fair comment applied. It must be
                    remembered that the Second Facebook Post was made at a time when Roy was
                    relatively unaware of what was going on, and he had not proceeded to write the
                    emails nor received any clarification as to what was going on. Given the wording
                    of the Second Facebook Post, I do not find that there was malice in writing the
                    Facebook post. I had briefly discussed the law on malice at [92] above, and
                    would add that the Defendant’s state of mind remains relevant to a finding
                    as to whether there is malice (see <em>Sukamto Sia</em> at
                    [52]). As noted in <em>Gatley</em> at para 21.7:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no liability in malicious falsehood for a
                        statement published in good faith. ... <em>Mere negligence is
                            not malice</em> ... A statement false in fact and calculated to
                        produce actual damage will therefore not support [an action
                        in malicious falsehood] if it was made in the belief, even a
                        careless belief, that it was true. <em>The defendant may have
                            acted stupidly in asserting a right, yet if he bona fide believed such
                            right to exist, no action lies</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    The words of the learned authors do well to
                    summarise both the position of the law and the actions of the Defendants in this
                    case. Therefore, I find that the Plaintiffs’ claim under the tort of
                    malicious falsehood as well as s 6(1) of the DA does not succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The SMS texts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Given my findings as elaborated at [74]-[82]
                    above, I also find that the Plaintiffs’ action does not succeed under the
                    tort of malicious falsehood as well as s 6(1) of the DA for the SMS
                    texts.</p>

                            for KB 528XL entitled “Inflatable Sampan” built for
                            fishing, rescue, leisure and military use</b> – The
                        Inflatable Sampan Brochure (printed on a single page) comprised, <em>inter alia</em>, a photograph of the inflatable boat
                        bearing the Kairos brand, a representation of the Kairos Trade Mark. The
                        textual information was largely concerned with the specifications of the
                        boat: its dimensions, weight, seating capacity etc. The main heading was
                        entitled “Inflatable Sampan built for Fishing, Rescue, Leisure &amp;
                        Military Use.” The Defendants contact details were set out at the
                        bottom of the page.</p>

                        points. The brochure also set out the Defendants contact details and
                        displayed the Kairos Brand in a prominent position.</p>

            <b>S/n 4 Picture for

                        photograph of the inflatable boat under the description “Crossover
                        between a Kayak and Boat!” The brochure set out the technical
                        specifications as well as a brief description of the boat. There was also a
                        photograph of an outboard motor branded “Makara” with the
                        words that the Makara 2 stroke outboard engine was recommended. The
                        Defendants contact details were set out at the bottom of the page with the
                        Kairos Brand.</p>

                        included at the top the Makara Brand as well as the Kairos
                    Brand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Originality and authorship </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    I deal with a preliminary issue at the
                    outset, which is whether the Defendants can claim to be the owner of the
                    copyright in the works. Two points arise. First, are the works original? Second,
                    are the Defendants the copyright owners?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    According to the Defendants, the photographs
                    listed at S/n 2 and S/n 4 in the table above were taken by Roy himself. The
                    brochures listed at S/n 1, S/n 3 and S/n 5 in the table above (collectively
                    referred to as “the brochures”) were said to be designed by an
                    employee of the Defendants known as Kushastha Tharusha Peiris
                        (“Kusha”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the Plaintiffs
                    argued that the Defendants had copied “word for word” some of the
                    specifications of their boats from another company in the USA, Saturn
                        Inflatables.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    The Plaintiffs tendered samples of the
                    marketing material of Saturn Inflatables to demonstrate the similarities with
                    the copyright works. Some similarities alluded to include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <b>Between the
                            Defendants’ brochure for KB 437 Crossover between Kayak and Boat
                            and Saturn Inflatables’ and Saturn Inflatable SK 430
                            webpage</b> – the exact wording of the phrases “wide
                        beam hull design for stability. You can stand in a “KaBoat”,
                        “Front Spray Skirt with water deflector guard and rope
                        lacing”, “Marine grade plywood transom with a one way drain
                        plug” and “Included: hand pump, repair kit, 2 oars and carry
                        bag”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <b>Between S/n 1 brochure for KB 528 XL and Saturn
                            Inflatables’ SK487XL webpage</b> – the technical
                        specifications are the same and the exact use of the wording of the phrase
                        “Included: hand pump, repair kit, 2 oars and carry
                        bag”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_171-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <b>Between S/n 3 and Saturn Inflatables’
                            Electrical Pump webpage</b> – a list of other products
                        which the electrical pump would be perfect for, with some minor adjustments,
                        as well as the specifications of the product.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    For completeness, I would add that the
                    Plaintiffs did not appear to contest the originality of the photographs, that is
                    to say the pictures listed at S/n 2 and S/n 4 and the photographs used in S/n 1,
                    S/n 3 and S/n 5 in the table above, thereby accepting that the Defendants had
                    indeed taken the photographs. In any case, a perusal of the marketing material
                    of Saturn Inflatables does not show similar photographs. Furthermore, I also
                    note that the Plaintiffs did not seem to adduce any evidence that showed that
                    the S/n 5 had been copied. Indeed whilst the evidence could have been clearer,
                    the Defendants’ case was that Roy had instructed his employee to produce
                    the brochure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    According to the Plaintiffs, these
                    similarities should be taken into account in considering the Defendants’
                    claim in copyright infringement. The point behind this assertion may have been
                    to challenge whether the brochures were original works in which copyright could
                    subsist in the first place (although this was not clear from the pleadings). I
                    pause here to add that the similarities might also be relevant in determining
                    whether the Plaintiffs had copied a substantial part of the Defendants’
                    copyright works if these were indeed found to be original.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    To the extent that the Plaintiffs are
                    challenging originality, I do not find merit in the Plaintiffs’ argument.
                    Whilst the Plaintiffs assert that the specifications and text material set out
                    in the Defendants brochures’ were substantially the same and copied from
                    Saturn Inflatables, I am satisfied that the Defendants’ brochures are, as
                    a whole, original works in which copyright subsists. It is important to note
                    that it is each brochure <em>as a whole</em> that the
                    Defendants assert copyright in. The question is whether each brochure as a whole
                    is an original literary work. The fact that some parts may be copied from
                    elsewhere does not mean that the work as a whole lacks originality for copyright
                    purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    During cross-examination, Roy was questioned
                    on the above-mentioned similarities. He testified that all he had done was to
                    instruct his employee Kusha to design the brochure using his original
                    photographs – he did not tell Kusha to copy anything.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Whilst this may be so, this does not necessarily
                    mean that any copyright in the copied Saturn Inflatables material was not
                    infringed. I say no more on this since there is no claim by Saturn Inflatables
                    for infringement and there is no need for me to pronounce on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Kusha was not called to give evidence. I
                    also note that whilst the specifications were largely similar to those in the
                    Saturn Inflatables material (where they were also listed in a Table), Roy had
                    explained (during cross-examination) that the specifications were also available
                    from his supplier Rongcheng. The point behind this appears to be that the
                    similarities in the specifications did not necessarily mean that the Defendants
                    had copied the information from Saturn Inflatables. Nevertheless, given the
                    exact phrases used (as set out above), the Plaintiffs’ position is that
                    the Defendants must have copied some of the information and specifications from
                    Saturn Inflatables’ material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The difficulty for the Plaintiffs, however,
                    is that even if this was the position, it does not follow that the
                    Defendants’ brochures were lacking in originality as a whole. Whilst this
                    information (the specifications) was available on a webpage for Saturn
                    Inflatables, the information in the Defendants’ works was presented in the
                    form of brochures. Although the specifications might be the same, the brochures
                    were clearly designed to promote information to consumers in a different way.
                    Take for example the Defendants’ brochure for KB528XL<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> (S/n 1 in the table
                    above) compared against Saturn Inflatables’ webpage for
                        SK487XL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The Defendants’ brochure is a one page
                    brochure with two tables presenting the technical specifications of the product.
                    There is a single picture of the product, and its main features are listed in
                    point form. On the other hand, Saturn Inflatables’ webpage for SK487XL is
                    largely in prose form, contains customer reviews and has numerous videos and
                    photographs of the boat. It is by far more comprehensive then the
                    Defendants’ brochure. Comparing the two, I am more than satisfied that
                    while some information is the same, it is clearly being promoted and presented
                    in a different way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The evidence was that the photographs were
                    taken by the Defendants and the Defendants’ brochures were designed (in
                    terms of the organisation and presentation of the information) by the
                    Defendants. While the brochures as a whole may have been simple, simplicity
                        <em>per se</em> does not prevent a work from acquiring
                    copyright. All that is needed is that the author created it and has not
                    slavishly copied it from another (see <em>Auvi Pte Ltd v Seah
                        Siew Tee</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 786). For completeness, I also accept
                    the Defendants’ claim that the individual photographs are original
                    artistic works in their own right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    For this reason, I am satisfied that the
                    Defendants’ photographs and brochures were original works in which
                    copyright subsisted. The works were produced by the Second Defendant and an
                    employee (Kusha) who was acting in the course of his employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Infringement by the Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    In order for the Defendants to succeed on
                    the counterclaim for copyright infringement, it is necessary to demonstrate that
                    the Plaintiffs had indeed reproduced a substantial part of the copyright work
                    without the licence of the copyright owner. This is a two-stage inquiry. Did the
                    Plaintiffs copy from the copyright works? If so, was the material copied a
                    substantial part of the copyright work?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Turning to the question of copying, it is
                    well established that what is required is sufficient proof of a causal
                    connection between the copyright works and the alleged infringements. The
                    question as to whether the alleged copyist was consciously aware of the
                    connection is irrelevant. In the absence of an admission of copying, the
                    beginning of proof normally lies in establishing similarity together with proof
                    of access (opportunity to copy) (see <em>LB Plastics Ltd v Swish
                        Products Ltd</em> [1979] RPC 551 at 619 and <em>Creative Technology Ltd v Aztech Systems Pte Ltd</em> [1997] 1 SLR
                    621 at 634).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In this case, it is clear that that there
                    are many significant points of similarity between the copyright works and the
                    Modified Brochures. For example, the Plaintiffs’ brochure promoting its
                    “3 – 4 Man Inflatable Rescue Boat” was almost exactly the
                    same as the Defendants’ brochure for their boat KB 430 (“Crossover
                    between Kayak and Boat”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Indeed, not only are these brochures almost the
                    same in terms of informational content and arrangement it is to be noted that
                    the Plaintiffs’ brochure sets out an almost identical reproduction of the
                    Defendants’ photograph of KB 430 (S/n 4).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Similarly, a comparison between the
                    Plaintiffs’ brochure for the 6-8 man inflatable boat shows a strong
                    resemblance to the Defendants’ brochure for the KB 528XL (S/n 1). Even
                    though there are some differences in terms of the branding and addresses it is
                    noted that the details are the same. The photograph depicted in the
                    Plaintiffs’ brochure is also very similar to the Defendants’
                    photograph of KB 528XL (S/n 2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Turning to the brochures for the electric
                    pumps, however, I do not think that the brochures used by the Plaintiffs and the
                    Defendants (S/n 3) are materially the same. The photographs used are different,
                    and while the brochure for the Plaintiffs promotes the “Key
                    Features” of the electrical pump, S/n 3 instead promotes the
                    “Perfect product[s]” which the electrical pump can be used
                    together with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Finally, in the case of the brochure for the
                    Makara engines “10 HP” (the Defendants’ brochure being S/n
                    5), there is also strong similarity between the text as well as the depicted
                    photograph of the engine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    From the above, it is clear that a number of
                    the Modified Brochures clearly made use of the pictures of the Defendants’
                    boats (S/n 2 and S/n 4 of the copyright works). These appear to have been
                    digitally modified to suit the design of the Modified Brochures. In any case,
                    Tedric during cross-examination had in fact admitted that the Plaintiffs had
                    copied these from the Defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Looking at the evidence as a whole, I am
                    satisfied that the Plaintiffs had indeed copied from the Defendants’
                    brochures and photographs. The question that remains is whether the taking was
                    substantial such as to amount to infringement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    In deciding this, the Court notes the
                    well-established principle that substantiality is generally determined on a
                    qualitative basis. Copyright is concerned with protecting original expression
                    and not basic facts. Further, what is in issue is whether what has been copied
                    is a substantial part of the copyright work (as opposed to the infringing work).
                    In determining this, the Court is entitled to bear in mind the relative
                    simplicity of expression in the work. Copyright, after all, is about protecting
                    original expression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    Although copyright subsists in the copyright
                    works, the brochures basically set out the specifications of the products along
                    with additional descriptions of some other features of the products and in some
                    cases, addresses and contact details. It is apparent that in the case of the
                    boats, much of the technical information was copied by the Defendants from
                    Saturn Inflatables. That said, it would not be surprising if the products were
                    generally from the same manufacturer or the same line of manufacturers that the
                    specifications of the products would be largely similar. The copying of a part
                    of a copyright work which is not original to the copyright work will not
                    ordinarily be regarded as a substantial part of the copyright work. For this
                    reason, if the question of infringement (substantiality) rested solely on the
                    taking of the technical specifications of the boats, I doubt that a case of
                    substantial taking would have been made out in the case of the brochures for the
                    boats. The picture however changes, literally and metaphorically, when the
                    photographs are taken into account. The Court has found that these were taken by
                    Roy and were original artistic works in their own right. These photographs were
                    clearly taken and used by the Plaintiffs. Accordingly, I find (leaving aside the
                    question of licence) that a case of infringement has been made out in respect of
                    the photographs for KB 430 and KB 528 XL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    In the case of the brochures for the Makara
                    engine (S/n 5), it is noted that there is no evidence that the specifications
                    and their arrangement in simple table form and the photographs were copied by
                    the Defendants from elsewhere. That being so, I find on the evidence before me
                    that the material taken from these brochures amounted to a substantial part of
                    these works. It will be recalled that Roy’s evidence was that he had
                    instructed Kusha to produce the brochures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    In the case of the brochures for the
                    electric pump, as I had observed above, I did not find that there was any
                    similarity between the brochure of the Plaintiffs and that of the Defendants. I,
                    therefore, find that there was no copying of the brochures for the electric
                    pump.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    The main defence the Plaintiffs raise is to
                    be found in their assertion that there was a verbal reseller agreement (as
                    briefly stated above at [13] –[16]) between them and the Defendants, where
                    it was agreed that the Plaintiffs could develop brochures of Kairos’
                    products without their logo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    Copyright infringement only arises where the
                    act of reproduction is done without the licence of the copyright owner. The
                    issue that needs to be addressed is whether there was in fact a verbal reseller
                    agreement and if so whether permission (to use the copyrighted works) was
                    granted by the Defendants as part of this agreement. The legal burden of
                    establishing that the act of copying was done without the licence of the
                    copyright falls on the shoulders of the copyright owner. That said, Roy’s
                    position is that no such licence or permission was granted to the Plaintiffs.
                    The Plaintiffs, on the other hand, assert that a licence was indeed granted as
                    part of the terms of an oral reseller agreement. To this end, oral evidence of
                    the alleged agreement was led by the Plaintiffs. Whether or not this was in
                    response to an evidential burden or otherwise, I am not satisfied that there was
                    an oral reseller agreement as alleged or that, if there was, a licence to copy
                    had been granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    As briefly described above, according to the
                    Plaintiffs, the verbal reseller agreement was reached at a meeting between the
                    Plaintiffs and the Defendants that occurred after the Plaintiffs placed their
                    second and third order with the Defendants and before 28 October 2011 (the date
                    of the training session conducted by Francis). It was asserted that it was
                    “verbally agreed that the marketing department of Golden Season could
                    develop brochures of Kairos’ products”, and also that the
                    Defendants had promised the Plaintiffs to remove their prices from the Internet
                    to protect its resellers and not to post their prices on the Internet. In
                    support of the existence of this agreement, the Plaintiffs argue that in a
                    number of emails exchanged between the Defendants and them, the Defendants had
                    used the term “reseller” in describing them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Apart from the bare assertions made by the
                    Plaintiffs, the only evidence that supports the Plaintiffs’ case is these
                    emails. At the very best, some inferences might be drawn from how the business
                    relationship between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants developed. As submitted
                    by the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs were the Defendants’ “biggest
                    customer at that time” and therefore according to the Plaintiffs an
                    inference should be drawn that the Defendants would have agreed largely with
                    their suggestion to allow the Plaintiffs to use the copyrighted works. The
                    Plaintiffs also submit that it was only logical that the Defendants would have
                    allowed this, if not, potential clients would go straight to the
                    Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    It might also be true that the Defendants
                    had, to some extent, indicated their willingness to work with the Plaintiffs and
                    to develop a formal reseller arrangement (exclusive or otherwise). To this end,
                    some discussions may have taken place. However, there is no sufficient
                    corroborating evidence suggesting such an agreement was made. Tedric himself
                    could not remember exactly when this meeting occurred. Given that this was an
                    agreement between two corporate entities conducted by two businessmen, both
                    having some experience in the business world, it would only be reasonable to
                    expect some documentary proof, be it in the form of emails, contemporaneous
                    notes, call logs, or messages evidencing the existence of such an agreement.
                    There, however, remains none of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Even then, as pointed out by the Defendants,
                    an agreement to appoint the Plaintiffs as reseller is distinct and different
                    from an agreement allowing the use of the copyrighted works. Taking the
                    Plaintiffs’ case at its highest, the emails suggest that the Plaintiffs
                    and Defendants <em>may</em> have struck some form of
                    agreement <em>vis-à-vis</em> reselling the
                    Defendants’ products. However, even if I am willing to find that there was
                    an oral reseller agreement between the parties, that in itself lends little
                    weight to the Plaintiffs’ arguments that there was an express agreement
                    allowing them to use the copyrighted works. To be sure, an implied licence or an
                    implied term granting such a licence would safeguard the Plaintiffs. That being
                    said, however, there is little basis for such a finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    I, therefore, find that the use and copying
                    of the copyright works as discussed above were without the licence of the
                    Defendant copyright owner and that the Defendants’ counterclaim in
                    copyright infringement succeeds save in the case of the brochure for the
                    pumps.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    For purposes of completeness, and by way of
                    passing comment, this would also mean that the Defendants can rely on the
                    defence of justification in so far as the defamatory statements relate to the
                    Plaintiffs infringing on their copyrights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendants’ counterclaim in trademark
                infringement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Apart from a counterclaim in copyright
                    infringement, the Defendants have also counterclaimed against the Plaintiffs for
                    passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    It is noted that from the pleadings and
                    submissions, it is not entirely clear exactly what the Defendants are asserting
                    in respect of passing off. In their defence and counterclaim (Amendment No. 2)
                    dated 30 August 2013, the Defendants plead that “the Plaintiffs
                    misrepresented and/or passed off Kairos Boats [(Model No. KB 430 and KB 528XL)]
                    as being associated with the <em>First Defendant</em>, when
                    that was not the case.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> The Defendants conclude by asking
                    for an injunction against the Plaintiffs from “passing off the Passed Off
                    Kairos Boats as being associated with the <em>First
                        Plaintiff</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Nevertheless, it appears that the
                    Defendants’ counterclaim is founded on the assertion that the Plaintiffs
                    were “misrepresenting to the public that the Kairos boats were in fact
                    Golden Season boats.” This can be discerned from the numerous examples
                    raised by the Defendants, such as how the Plaintiffs had represented to the SRC
                    that the boats used in the Thailand floods were boats of Golden Season, how the
                    Plaintiffs had referenced a photo of Kairos boats with the Thai Prime Minister
                    Yingluck as Golden Season Boats, and how the Plaintiffs had replaced
                    Kairos’ trademarks in their brochures. In summary, as submitted by the
                    Defendants, the Plaintiffs wanted to “pass off the Kairos business as
                    being that of Golden Season.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    As an observation, I note that the
                    Defendants’ pleadings (and submissions) rely only on the common law tort
                    of passing off – there is no mention of or reliance on the Trade Marks Act
                    (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed). The subsequent analysis therefore proceeds solely in
                    respect of an action in passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    After considering the arguments of the
                    parties, I find that the Plaintiffs are not liable for passing
                off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    It is trite that in order to succeed in an
                    action under the tort of passing off, a plaintiff must establish the
                    “classical trinity” of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage (see
                        <em>Novelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd and another</em>
                    [2009] 3 SLR(R) 216 (“<em>Amanresorts</em>”)
                    at [37]). Passing off in its classic form occurs when one trader represents his
                    goods to be those of another trader. As summarised by Lord Oliver in <em>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc</em> [1990] 1
                    WLR 491 at 880:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general proposition:
                        no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may
                        be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action
                        has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must
                        establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which
                        he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the
                        identifying “get-up” (whether it consists simply of a brand
                        name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or
                        packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the
                        public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive
                        specifically of the plaintiff’s goods or services. Secondly, he must
                        demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or
                        not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods
                        or services offered by him are the goods or services of the
                        plaintiff…Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a
                            <em>quia timet</em> action that he is likely to
                        suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the
                        defendant’s misrepresentation that the source of the defendant’s
                        goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the
                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    In this case, however, it appears that the
                    Defendants do not claim that the Plaintiffs have represented the
                    Plaintiffs’ goods as those of the Defendants. It is, in fact, the converse
                    – the Defendants claim that the Plaintiffs are representing <em>the Defendants’</em> goods as those of the Plaintiffs.
                    This is, therefore, not a classic case of passing off, but instead, a case of
                    “inverse passing off”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    There have not been many cases on inverse
                    passing off in Singapore, though the doctrine is clearly part of our law, as
                    affirmed by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Tessensohn
                        Denyse Bernadette (trading as Clea Professional Image Consultants) v John
                        Robert Powers School Inc and others</em> [1994] 3 SLR 308
                        (“<em>John Robert Powers
                    School</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    To this end, I start with the observation
                    that while “inverse passing off is not a nominate tort in its own right
                    but is an example of an actionable misrepresentation to which the normal
                    principles of passing off apply” (see <em>QB Net Co Ltd v
                        Earnson Management (S) Pte Ltd and others</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1 at
                    [16]), the boundaries and scope of inverse passing off are not as well developed
                    as classic passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    I begin with the decision of the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>John Robert Powers School</em>, which
                    affirmed the doctrine of inverse passing off. At [25], the Court of Appeal held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear to us that not only is it passing-off to misrepresent that
                        one’s goods or services were those of another, but <em>it is also passing-off to misrepresent the inverse: that another
                            person’s goods or services are one’s own</em>. The
                        three essential elements of passing off equally apply to such passing-off as
                        well. Therefore, to succeed in an action for inverse passing-off, a
                        plaintiff must prove that there is goodwill attached to their goods or
                        services; that the defendants misrepresented themselves as the commercial
                        source of the goods or services in question; and that the plaintiff’s
                        goodwill was damaged as a consequence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    In <em>John Robert Powers
                        School</em>, the first respondent, John Robert Powers School Inc
                    (“JRP”), was a well-known American company which operated the John
                    Robert Powers School in the US providing courses on social development and
                    self-improvement. The appellant obtained a franchisee license and operated a JRP
                    school in Singapore. This franchise agreement was terminated on 14 February
                    1988. Thereafter, the appellant set up her own school under the name Clea
                    Professional Image Consultants. The respondents later alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that the appellant had passed off her school
                    as JRP and her courses as JRP courses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    One of the issues that arose was whether, by
                    using material previously owned by JRP, in terms of allowing access to students
                    and teachers to the materials, the appellant was liable for “inverse
                    passing off”. At [26], the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the
                    High Court, finding that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Copies of the JRP notes had been left on shelves for all to take without
                        the notes containing any acknowledgement of their source. Anyone who took
                        them would naturally have thought that they were the work of the appellant.
                        Although the appellant did not distribute these notes to the students, they
                        were left on the open shelves and were easily accessible to the students.
                        The inference was that they were left there deliberately for certain
                        purpose, <em>ie</em> to render them accessible to the
                        students. Thus, by making the notes available in that manner, she was in
                        fact holding out to her students and customers that the notes were the
                        product of her own efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    At the High Court (see <em>John Robert Powers School Inc v Tessensohn Denyse Bernadette</em>
                    [1993] 2 SLR(R) 798 (“<em>John Robert Powers School
                        (HC)</em>”), the trial judge had cited the decisions of
                        <em>Bristol Conservatories Ltd v Conservatories Custom Built
                        Ltd</em> [1989] RPC 455 (“<em>Bristol
                        Conservatories</em>”) and <em>John Henderson
                        &amp; Sons v Alexander Munro</em> [1905] 7 F 636 (“<em>John Henderson</em>”) in explaining the concept of
                    inverse passing off. These decisions, in turn, are based on a number of English
                    decisions which merit closer scrutiny.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    A useful starting point is the decision of
                    the English Court of Appeal in <em>Samuelson v Producers
                        Distributing Co Ltd</em> (1931) 48 RPC 580 and at [1932] 1 Ch 201
                        (“<em>Samuelson</em>”). In <em>Samuelson</em>, the plaintiff wrote a theatrical sketch that
                    was performed before the King and Queen and received good (laudatory) press
                    notices. The defendants made a film said to be similar in some respects to the
                    plaintiffs’ sketch. It was admitted, however, that as a whole, it was
                    different and did not constitute copyright infringement. The defendants
                    advertised their film referencing the press notices (which had been deliberately
                    modified) so as to make them appear to refer to the film. There was no reference
                    to the plaintiff in the advertisement. It was submitted for the defendants that
                    the claim could not lie in passing off because that form of action required a
                    representation whereby other persons are induced to believe that the goods or
                    the production of the defendants are the goods or production of the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    The Court of Appeal rejected the
                    defendant’s argument, finding them liable for passing off. Although it was
                    a unanimous decision, there are slight differences in the reasoning
                    employed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    Lord Hanworth at 588 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a passing off action and the ground on which I think the plaintiff
                        is entitled to complain is that, as I have said, in substance he remains the
                        author of this sketch .... and, <em>if he was entitled to the
                            authorship and the copyright and to the reproduction of his sketch, then
                            the defendants have attempted to pass off and to make use of the
                            atmosphere which belonged to the plaintiff</em>, in favour of
                        their production; and therefore it was right for the plaintiff to take
                        proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I note in passing that in the <em>Chancery Division
                        Report</em> of the case, the equivalent passage from Lord
                    Hanworth’s judgment at 208 refers to “use of the reputation which
                    belonged to the plaintiff’s sketch” as opposed to the
                    “atmosphere”. No matter, the core of Lord Hanworth’s
                    reasoning appears to be founded on unfair competition or
                appropriation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    Lawrence LJ, on the other hand, framed the
                    matter in a way which is perhaps closer to the classic form of passing off. At
                    592, he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiff and his licensees had the exclusive right of making a film
                        version of the sketch, and the defendant company, in effect, by the
                        advertisement, said that their production was a film version of the
                        plaintiff's sketch, <em>thereby misleading the public
                            concerned into the belief that the defendants' production was a
                            production which was one which the plaintiff alone could have
                            produced</em>; <em>in other words, that it was the
                            plaintiff's production</em>. To put it in other words, they were
                        passing off on to the public their film production as being a film
                        production of the plaintiff's sketch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In this way, it could be argued that this was a classic case of
                    passing off instead of reverse passing off. As can be seen, Lawrence LJ held
                    that the public would have thought that the defendant’s production was
                    produced by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Romer LJ whilst acknowledging that this was
                    not a classic case of passing went on to hold (at 593) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But the cases in which the court has restrained passing off in the popular
                        and usual sense, are merely instances of the application by the court of a
                        much wider principle, the principle being that the court will always
                        interfere by injunction to restrain irreparable injury being done to the
                        plaintiff's property. In the present case if, as we hold to be the case, the
                        plaintiff was entitled to his copyright in 'The New Car', [his sketch) he
                        was, by virtue of the Copyright Act, entitled to the sole right of producing
                        the sketch in film form. That was an item of his property, and how it can be
                        said that these advertisements might not cause irreparable damage to that
                        property of the plaintiff passes my comprehension.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>What is clear is that all three judges agreed that, even though
                    the facts did not fall squarely within a classic case of passing off, the
                    defendant was liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    I turn next to the case of <em>Plomien Fuel Economiser Co Ltd v National School of Salesmanship
                        Ltd</em> (1943) 60 RPC 209 (“<em>Plomein</em>”), which is another decision of the English Court
                    of Appeal. In <em>Plomein</em>, the plaintiffs were
                    manufacturers of a fuel economiser marketed under the name
                    “Plomien”. The defendants, who at one time acted as sale agents
                    for the plaintiffs, broke that relationship and started themselves to market an
                    economiser which was manufactured for them. It was alleged that the defendants
                    engaged in a deliberate attempt to deceive their clients by putting forward
                    their economiser as being the same as the plaintiffs. Specifically, it was
                    alleged that they represented that certain tests which had been made were tests
                    made in connection with the defendants' economiser. In fact, they were tests in
                    respect of the plaintiffs' economiser. They represented that certain economisers
                    which had been fitted for a number of purchasers, and which were in fact the
                    plaintiffs' economiser, were the defendants' economiser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    The Court of Appeal, likewise, found the
                    defendants liable for passing off. It was argued there that no confusion had
                    arisen. The fact being that none of the customers who purchased the goods from
                    the defendants knew the plaintiffs. Lord Greene, however, disagreed and at 214,
                    explained why the action would still succeed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is perfectly true that there is no evidence that a single person who
                        purchased an economiser from the defendants had ever heard of the
                        plaintiffs; but in passing off there is no necessity that the person who is
                        deceived should have known the name of the person who complains of the
                        passing off. In many cases the name is not known at all. It is quite
                        sufficient, in my opinion, to constitute passing off in fact, if a person
                        being minded to obtain goods which are identified in his mind with a
                        definite commercial source is led by false statements to accept goods coming
                        from a different commercial source</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having got them in their shop, what do they do? <em>They do
                            not sell those customers the goods which those customers have come to
                            buy; they sell them goods of their own manufacture, which are quite
                            different, in the sense that they are not the required
                            manufacture.</em> If that is not passing off, I really do not know
                        what is. It is perfectly true, and I am willing to assume, that not one
                        single customer who went to the shop (I use the word 'shop' of course
                        metaphorically, it was not a shop at all; it was done by orders by post and
                        by travellers and so forth) had ever heard of the plaintiffs or ever heard
                        that they put on the market an economiser. <em>That, to my
                            mind, matters not one bit when it is realised that those customers were
                            coming with the intention of getting goods from a particular source,
                            namely, the same source as those from which the satisfied customers had

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    As can be seen, the reasoning employed in
                        <em>Plomein</em> is not far removed from that of
                    Lawrence LJ in <em>Samuelson</em> – at the end of the
                    day, the consumer on the particular facts is made to believe that the product he
                    purchases is from a <em>particular source</em> (<em>ie</em>, the plaintiff), when in fact it came from the
                    defendant. To that end, this still fits within the classic conception of the
                    tort of passing off, as the consumer is still misled to believe that the
                    defendant’s goods are those of the plaintiff (the particular source the
                    consumer had in mind). It does not matter if the consumer does not know the
                    actual identity of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    Both <em>Samuelson</em>
                    and <em>Plomein</em> were considered by the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Bristol Conservatories</em> (which was, in turn,
                    considered by the Singapore High Court in <em>John Robert Powers
                        School (HC)</em>). In <em>Bristol
                        Conservatories</em>, the defendants’ salesmen showed prospective
                    customers a portfolio of photographs of ornamental conservatories as if these
                    constituted a sample of the defendants’ goods and workmanship. In fact,
                    these were photographs of the plaintiff’s ornamental conservatories. This
                    was held to amount to passing off as the defendants had misrepresented that they
                    were the commercial source of those conservatories. As stated by Ralph Gibson LJ
                    at 462:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case the substance of the misrepresentation by the defendants, as
                        alleged by the plaintiffs, is fairly capable of being expressed thus: "If
                        you order a conservatory from us you will be getting a conservatory
                        designed, manufactured and constructed by the people who have earned the
                        goodwill and reputation that properly belongs to the party which secured the
                        orders and designed, manufactured and constructed the conservatories shown
                        in these photographs. The conservatories shown in the photographs indicate
                        the skill, the experience and the reputation of the party who designed and
                        made them. That party is Custom Built." But, of course, it was not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    By showing the photographs to prospective
                    customers, goodwill arose towards the supplier of those conservatories and was
                    simultaneously misappropriated by the defendants. The Court of Appeal found that
                    there was likewise no need for the public to have been “confused”
                    – “he is told simply and untruthfully that Custom Built designed
                    and constructed the conservatories which provide the evidence for the experience
                    skill and reputation of the Plaintiffs.” This was sufficient to sustain
                    an action in passing off. As can be seen, the focus still concerns the <em>source</em> of the product. The public is misled to think
                    that they are purchasing a product from a manufacturer with a certain amount of
                    goodwill, while in fact, they are purchasing a product from the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    In coming to this view, I agree with the
                    comment by the learned authors of David Kitchin <em>et al,
                        Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2011) (“<em>Kerly’s</em>”) at para 18-132 that the reason why liability
                    was found was because customers were deceived into believing that the defendant
                    was the company that produced the conservatory depicted in the photographs. To
                    this end, the learned authors’ comment bears repeating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although it was open to the defendant to use photographs of the
                        claimant’s product to indicate that it could make products like it, it
                        went further and made an actionable misrepresentation which could have
                        caused damage to the claimant in the form of lost sales (in the sense that
                        all the defendant’s potential customers could have been customers of
                        the claimant had not the representation been made).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    The important point, as the learned authors
                    of <em>Kerly’s</em> stress at para 18-132, is that
                    the tort of passing off is not a tort providing a remedy in <em>all</em> cases of deception. Passing off is not about deceptive
                    statements <em>in vacuo</em>. Neither is passing off a tort
                    that covers product mis-description <em>per se</em>. The
                    learned authors quite rightly stress that there must be an actionable
                    misrepresentation which harms the claimant’s goodwill in a name or get-up.
                    Mere appropriation is insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    I return to the decision in <em>John Robert Powers School</em>. Comparing the cases discussed
                    above and the situation in <em>John Robert Powers
                        School</em>, the High Court observed that the only difference between
                    the two was that in the former, the misappropriation was done in the course of
                    advertisement whereas in the latter, the misappropriation was done in the course
                    of the trade itself. It was reasoned that that should make no difference to the
                    plaintiffs’ entitlement to a remedy. This was accepted by the Court of
                    Appeal, who affirmed that a defendant can be liable for “inverse passing
                    off” and that the trinity of goodwill, misrepresentation and confusion
                    still applied. What is meant by “confusion” is that the consumer
                    is deceived as to the trade origin of the products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    As a result of the decision in <em>John Robert Powers School</em>, whatever view is taken of the
                    facts of the case, a defendant, in Singapore, can be liable when he passes off
                    the goods of someone else as his own under what is known as “inverse
                    passing off”. I would further observe that given the discussion in the
                    paragraph above, there is clearly room to develop this concept in Singapore law.
                    Given the relative lack of case authority on inverse passing off, a few
                    observations on the rationale for inverse passing off may be helpful before
                    turning to an application to the facts at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The policy reasons of passing off and the goodwill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    At first blush, it is perhaps understandable
                    if the concept of inverse passing off, as recognised in <em>John
                        Robert Powers School</em>, is regarded as not sitting nicely within
                    the framework and policy reasons justifying the existence of the law of passing
                    off. As observed by the author in Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <em>Law of
                        Intellectual Property of Singapore</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, Rev
                    Ed, 2014) ("<em>Ng-Loy on IP Law</em>") at para
                    18.1.15:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given that there was nothing in the defendant’s course notes which
                        expressly referred to the plaintiff, it is difficult to see how there could
                        be passing off in the sense that the students would connect the
                        defendant’s school with the plaintiff (albeit in the reverse way).
                        Where is the confusion when the defendant shows a customer the
                        plaintiff’s product as an example of his (the defendant’s) work
                        when the customer who buys from the defendant knows he is buying from the
                        defendant? Strictly speaking, reverse passing off just does not fit nicely
                        within the boundaries of passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The author, however, goes on (also at para 18.1.15) to provide a
                    possible way of interpreting the decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One way of understanding this concept of inverse or reverse passing off is
                        to recognise that it is really an extension of the classic form of passing
                        off to prevent what the court sees as free riding. This analysis of inverse
                        passing off is offered by Prof Gerald Dworkin. In his study comparing the
                        ways in which different countries prevent unfair competition, he found that
                        in common law countries where there is no general tort of unfair
                        competition, the courts cope to a large extent by expanding the action for
                        passing off. The High Court’s judgment in <em>John
                            Robert Powers</em> case certainly contains suggestions that would
                        support Prof Dworkin’s analysis. In finding for the plaintiff, the
                        court used terms such as the defendant ‘robbing’ the
                        plaintiff’s goodwill, and how this goodwill was
                        ‘misappropriated’ by the defendant to build her own
                        reputation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    That said, Hazel Carty in <em>An Analysis of the Economic Torts</em>, (Oxford University Press, 2nd
                    Ed, 2010) comments at p 290 that cases such as <em>Bristol
                        Conservatories</em> are best seen as examples falling within the
                    classic trinity. Goodwill lies at the heart of the classic trinity. In cases of
                    true inverse passing off, the allegation (or misrepresentation) is that a
                    quality misrepresentation has taken place resulting in damage to goodwill.
                    Whilst there is merit in this view (that inverse passing off derives from and is
                    consistent with the classic trinity), it should be noted that a loose
                    application of the elements runs the risk of turning the tort into
                    misappropriation <em>simpliciter</em>: a tort based on some
                    broad notion of unfairness. For this reason, it is important to apply the
                    elements (goodwill, misrepresentation and likelihood of deception) with care.
                    Whether the common law in Singapore should go further and develop a true tort of
                    unfair competition is not a matter which must be decided in the case at hand.
                    The development of a general tort of misappropriation or unfair competition
                    involves broad-based policy concerns involving aspects of intellectual property
                    law as well as competition law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    Moving on, I note that the tort of passing
                    off exists primarily to protect the interest of a trader in his trade mark and
                    indicia of origin. By doing this, consumer interests are also safeguarded. As
                    stated in <em>Ng-Loy on IP Law</em> at para 15.2.1, a
                    trader’s indicia of origin saves the consumer search time and costs and
                    results in a better allocation of resources. The learned author
                    continues:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From this perspective, traders should be encouraged to differentiate their
                        goods or services from those of other traders, and to invest time, effort
                        and money to create and develop a trade mark to act as the badge of origin
                        and/or of quality for their goods or services. Protecting the trader’s
                        trade mark is an incentive for him to make these investments. Trade mark
                        protection is justified on this economic and utilitarian basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The other justification lies in the ‘just desserts’ theory:
                        the trader deserves protection for the time and effort he spent in building
                        up a particular sign as his trade mark, and he should be protected against
                        unfair competition from traders who are out to take a free ride on the
                        goodwill or reputation he has acquired for his goods or services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    One can see how these justifications are
                    addressed in the case of <em>Bristol Conservatories</em>,
                        <em>Samuelson</em> and <em>Plomein</em>. From the perspective of the consumer, a mistake is made
                    as to the attributes (workmanship, quality etc) of the product (the
                    conservatory, the film, the economiser) that he is acquiring from the defendant.
                    The consumer is induced to believe that the defendant is also the manufacturer
                    of or associated with certain similar products or services which enjoy goodwill
                    in the market place. The consumer is, thereby, induced to acquire the
                    defendant’s goods or services in the belief that the defendant’s
                    goods or services enjoy or share that same goodwill when in fact the goodwill in
                    those other goods or services belongs to a third party (the plaintiff). The fact
                    that the consumer does not know of the third party is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    In <em>Bristol
                        Conservatories</em>, the photographs of the plaintiffs’ product
                    suggested a certain level of skill and competence of the origin. In <em>Samuelson</em>, the positive press notices likewise suggested
                    some form of skill or quality since it was positively received by others. In
                        <em>Plomein</em>, the test results likewise suggested
                    quality. In all three cases, the defendant could be said to exploit the goodwill
                    of the plaintiff in order to mislead the consumer into buying the
                    defendant’s product. In this way the goodwill which the plaintiff enjoyed
                    in his business and the goods and services marketed under his business is
                    damaged. The defendant/seller/provider has wrongly appropriated the goodwill of
                    the plaintiff by false attribution to the defendant. In a sense, the defendant
                    is “high-jacking” the goodwill of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    It follows that notwithstanding the
                    recognition of inverse passing off, the core interest protected is still
                    goodwill. The reasoning of Lord Diplock in <em>Erven Warnink
                        Besloten Vennootschap v J Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd</em> [1979] AC
                    731 at 740 (commonly known as “The <em>Advocaat</em>
                    case”) bears repeating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unfair trading as a wrong actionable at the suit of other traders who
                        thereby suffer loss of business or goodwill may take a variety of forms, to
                        some of which separate labels have become attached in English law.
                        Conspiracy to injure a person in his trade or business is one, slander of
                        goods another, but most protean is that which is generally and nowadays,
                        perhaps misleadingly, described as passing off. The forms that unfair
                        trading takes will alter with the ways in which trade is carried on and
                        business reputation and goodwill acquired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    In a classic case of passing off, the
                    goodwill in a business is connected with the trade mark of (an indicator of
                    origin) the plaintiff. In deciding whether the element of goodwill is present,
                    the court generally looks at whether the plaintiff’s trade mark has
                    acquired a reputation. As accepted in <em>The Singapore
                        Professional Golfers' Association v Chen Eng Waye and others</em>
                    [2013] 2 SLR 495 (“<em>SPGA</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Goodwill has been described as "the attractive force which brings in
                            custom": <em>The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v
                            Muller &amp; Co's Margarine, Limited</em> [1901] AC
                        217 at 224. It connotes the magnetic quality of the product and its
                        association with the claimant such that customers return and patronise the
                        same business, or purchase the same product or other products from the same
                            brand: <em>Bently &amp;
                        Sherman</em> ([16]supra) at p 729. The goodwill in question is
                        the integral feature of the relationship between a trader and his customers
                        that the tort of passing off seeks to protect. The action for passing off is
                        not directly concerned with the protection of a mark, logo or get-up of a
                        business. That is more the province of the law of trade marks. Rather,
                        passing off is concerned with protecting the goodwill between a trader and
                        his customers: <em>CDL
                        Hotels</em> ([12] supra) at [45].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    In the classic case of passing off, the
                    goodwill is associated with the brand represented by the badge of origin. It is
                    therefore (as stated by the Court of Appeal in <em>SPGA</em> at [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">essential for the claimant to establish that its goodwill is sufficiently
                        associated with its name or brand such that its name or brand is
                        distinctive, <em>in that it denotes the goods and services of
                            the claimant to the exclusion of those of other
                        traders.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    In a case of inverse passing off, the
                    defendant is essentially trying to ride on the reputation (goodwill) of the
                    plaintiff so as to market his own goods or services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    Thus in <em>Bristol
                        Conservatories</em>, it could be said that some form of goodwill is
                    generated upon the consumer recognising the quality of the plaintiff’s
                    product, as represented by photographs set out in the Defendant’s
                    brochure. In <em>Bristol Conservatories</em>, the court at
                    465 explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lastly, the judge was wrong, I think, to proceed on the basis that the
                        plaintiffs were not alleging that they have a goodwill which was affected by
                        the use of the photographs. In truth, as Mr. Presctott submitted, <em>the goodwill was asserted and demonstrated as the photographs
                            were shown and was at the same moment misappropriated by Custom
                            Built</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    Similarly the good press notices of the
                    plaintiff’s theatrical sketch (and goodwill) was used to cloak the
                    defendant’s film in <em>Samuelson</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    Finally, I note that the <em>Advocaat</em> case was itself concerned with developing classic
                    passing off to cover a form of unfair trading which resulted in damage to
                    “shared” goodwill in the trade name “Advocaat.”
                    Classic passing off is concerned with a case where the goodwill in a trade name
                    belongs to a single proprietor. Shared goodwill looks to a scenario where a type
                    of product with particular and identifiable characteristics is known to the
                    public under a particular trade name such as “Advocaat” or
                    “Champagne.” The public (or relevant sector of the public) is
                    aware that goods carrying that trade name refer to goods with those
                    characteristics. In such cases, time, effort and expense will usually have been
                    expended, often over some time, by traders to develop the reputation and
                    goodwill in the trade name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    In the <em>Advocaat</em> case, the trade name was properly used in respect of a
                    Dutch drink made from eggs, sugar and a type of spirit. The
                    “spurious” product marketed as “Old English
                    Advocaat” was made from eggs, sugar and sherry. Sherry is a type of
                    fortified wine (not a spirit) and at that time attracted lower custom duties.
                    The spurious product was accordingly sold at a cheaper price. This was the
                    context in which Lord Diplock on the back of strong policy considerations
                    (unfair trading) found passing off had been committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    To be sure, the tort of passing off has not
                    yet been developed in Singapore into a general tort of unfair competition. Not
                    all instances of “unfair trading” constitute passing off or indeed
                    any tort. Nevertheless, within the established principles of passing off –
                    the protection of goodwill in a “trade mark” from
                    misrepresentations likely to cause damage, the general policy of providing a
                    level playing field has proven helpful in developing the tort. In this way,
                    classic passing off has expanded over the years to cover misrepresentations as
                    to the quality of the plaintiff’s product (selling second hand goods or
                    discontinued models as if they were new or current for example) as well as to
                    cover cases of shared goodwill. Inverse passing off is best seen as part of the
                    evolutionary and principled development of the tort.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    The test for goodwill, the requirement of
                    business aside, focuses on the public’s awareness of the plaintiff’s
                    mark and association of the mark with the goods or services as an indicator of
                    origin. Proof that the trade mark has acquired a reputation can come in the form
                    of evidence showing sales volume, and/or the extent and amount of advertisement
                    and media coverage of the business conducted under that mark (see <em>Ng-Loy on IP Law</em> at para 17.2.2). As stated by the High
                    Court in <em>Doctor's Associates Inc v Lim Eng Wah (trading as
                        SUBWAY NICHE)</em> [2012] 3 SLR 193 ("<em>Subway
                        Niche</em>") at [21] and accepted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Hai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and
                        another appeal</em> [2013] 2 SLR 941 at [34], example of factors that
                    should be taken into consideration include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_241-p2_a"></a>(a)     the market share held by the
                        registered mark;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_241-p2_b"></a>(b)     the nature of its use (whether or not it was intensive, widespread
                        and long-standing);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_241-p2_c"></a>(c)     the amount invested in promoting the mark;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_241-p2_d"></a>(d)     the proportion of the relevant class
                        of individuals who identified goods sold under the mark as emanating from a
                        particular source; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_241-p2_e"></a>(e)     any statements from trade associations and
                        chambers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    The First Defendant is a company established
                    in 2010 (although its name was later changed on 25 January 2012). I accept that
                    on the evidence the name “Kairos” is not a descriptive name
                    insofar as it does not describe boats. I also accept that the Defendants have
                    used the trade name Kairos in relation to the boats together with the term
                    “inflatable sampan”. Whilst inflatable sampan is to a degree
                    descriptive, the Defendants have asserted that the term “inflatable
                    sampan” is also distinctive of Kairos and that they have spent
                    substantial efforts in promoting Kairos boats on the internet and through
                    brochures. Furthermore, it is also asserted that Kairos Boats are
                    “supplied to, among others, NGOs, disaster units, rescue teams,
                    Government contractors, yacht charter operators and private yacht owners in
                    Singapore as well as in the region”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. Whilst
                    there is little evidence supporting the claim for widespread sales, I note that
                    there are a number of brochures promoting the Defendants and their products.
                    Even if there is insufficient evidence to support the assertion of goodwill in
                    the term “inflatable sampan”, I am satisfied that the Defendants
                    have acquired a reputation under the Kairos brand such as to generate
                    goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    This does not mean, however, that the
                    counterclaim for inverse passing off succeeds. To do so, it is necessary to
                    establish that the Plaintiffs, by inclusion of photographs of Kairos boats and
                    informational material into its modified brochures <em>etc</em>, is responsible for a misrepresentation that is likely to
                    damage the goodwill. To be clear, there is no evidence that the Defendants have
                    acquired any goodwill in the get-up of the inflatable boats. The position is the
                    same in respect of the use by the Plaintiffs of photographs of the Kairos boats
                    in operation in Thailand in its communications with SRC. Damage, in this sense,
                    broadly means appropriating the reputation of the Defendants for products of a
                    certain quality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    As noted above, in <em>Bristol Conservatories</em>, the plaintiffs’ conservatories
                    were designed and manufactured by the plaintiffs. At 463, Ralph Gibson LJ held
                    that the defendants, by using a portfolio of photographs of the
                    plaintiffs’ conservatories, was misrepresenting the position such as to
                    induce consumers to purchase conservatories from the defendants in order to get
                    a conservatory from the commercial source which had designed, constructed the
                    conservatories shown in the photographs. In this way, the prospective purchaser
                    was said (at 465) to have been told untruthfully that the defendants had
                    designed and built those conservatories (made by the plaintiffs). Those
                    conservatories were of course evidence of the experience, skill and reputation
                    of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    In the present case,it is clear that the
                    Defendants are not the manufacturers of the boats in question (or indeed the
                    electrical pumps and engines). The boats (both the Plaintiffs and Defendants
                    boats) were sourced from the same Chinese manufacturer. Indeed, when
                    cross-examined, Tedric stated that the Plaintiffs’ boats were obtained
                    from the same factory in China which supplied the Defendants. Tedric also
                    asserted that the design was taken by the Chinese factory from Saturn
                        Inflatables.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Whilst there was suggestion that the
                    Defendants asked for some modifications, the evidence on this was thin. No
                    witness from the Chinese manufacturer gave evidence. Further whilst the
                    Plaintiffs may have used photographs of Kairos boats in use during the Thai
                    floods in some communications, it is to be borne in mind that aside from the two
                    donated Kairos boats, Golden Season had indeed purchased (albeit at an alleged
                    discount) Kairos boats for use in the Thai floods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    On the evidence before me (including the
                    brochures produced by the Plaintiffs), I am not satisfied that the Plaintiffs
                    had thereby represented that they were Kairos or that they were passing
                    themselves off as being Kairos such as to damage the Kairos goodwill. Inverse
                    passing off is predicated on harm to goodwill arising from a misrepresentation.
                    In deciding whether a case has been made out the Court must examine the strength
                    of the goodwill and reputation, the nature of the goods and the extent to which
                    any indicia of origin is actually used in determining whether there is a
                    misrepresentation to the ordinary consumer (not moron shopping in a hurry) such
                    as to harm the goodwill. In the present case, is it likely that customers for
                    the inflatable boats will be deceived into thinking that when they buy such a
                    boat from the Plaintiffs, they are getting boats from the Defendants? Looking at
                    the evidence as a whole, I am not satisfied that the Defendants have established
                    a case of inverse passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    By way of conclusion, the Court recognises
                    that the breakdown of the business relationship between the Third Plaintiff and
                    the Second Defendant resulted in a bitter and emotionally charged dispute. The
                    Court accepts that defamation actions will often be stressful: perhaps
                    especially so where motives and intentions are called into question in the
                    context of defences such as qualified privilege and indeed damages. For this
                    reason, it is important that the evidence be confined to matters relevant to the
                    dispute. Whilst some of the issues raised (such as the past history of Hassan of
                    Mercy Relief) were unnecessary and indeed irrelevant to the case at hand, I
                    acknowledge the professionalism, candour and courtesy counsel extended to each
                    other during the hearings. While counsel robustly sought to establish their
                    opposing legal positions, parties were generally cordial and there was no
                    unnecessary delay in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    The First Plaintiff succeeds in the action
                    of defamation with regards to the email chain and is awarded S$15,000 in
                    damages. The Third Plaintiff succeeds in the defamation action in respect of the
                    email chain and is awarded in total S$50,000 in damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    The Defendants’ counterclaim in
                    copyright infringement (save for the pump brochure) succeeds, and the Plaintiffs
                    are to surrender or to file and serve an affidavit affirming the destruction of
                    the Modified Brochures within [ten] days from the date of my
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    Damages to be awarded to the Defendants for
                    copyright infringement are to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    I will hear parties on costs at a later
