<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
is an appeal against the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar
Kan Shuk Weng (“the AR”) in Summons No 2743 of 2013 (“SUM 2743/2013”)
given on 25 July 2013. SUM 2743/2013 concerned a discovery order
for certain documents which were allegedly covered by the Official Secrets
Act (Cap 213, 2012 Rev Ed) (“OSA”). After hearing the arguments of
both parties, with consideration given especially to the fact that
the OSA was involved, I am dismissing the appeal and I now give
my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
plaintiff, Elbow Holdings Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”), is a private limited
liability company incorporated in Singapore. The Plaintiff owns
and operates an “Australian themed” bar and bistro called “South
Coast Bar &amp; Bistro” at Units “#01-R7” and “#B1-R7” of the Marina
Bay Sands Shoppes Singapore (“the Premises”). The Premises were
subsequently renamed “The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands”. The unit
numbers have also been renamed as “#01-85” and “#01-85 at B1 level”
respectively. It appears that Unit “#01-85” is a kiosk located on
the Promenade (“the Promenade Kiosk”), whereas Unit “#01-85 at B1
level” is a basement kitchen (“the Basement Kitchen”) used to serve
the Promenade Kiosk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
defendant, Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd (“the Defendant”), is a private
limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Singapore. It
manages The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
dispute between the parties in the main suit, Suit No 954 of 2012 (“S
954/2012”), arises in connection with a lease agreement for the
Premises (as well as the actual lease itself) which was signed by
the parties on or around 8 March 2010 (“the Lease Agreement”). The
Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim were issued by the Plaintiff
on 7 November 2012. The Defence and Counterclaim was filed on 3
December 2012 and subsequently amended on 3 January 2013. This was
followed by the Plaintiff’s Reply and Defence to Counterclaim filed
on 20 December 2012 and further amended on 18 January 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
Plaintiff’s case is advanced on two fronts, briefly summarised as follows.
First, the Plaintiff argues that it was induced into concluding
the Lease Agreement as a result of certain representations alleged
to have been made by or on behalf of the Defendant during the pre-signing
negotiations. These representations essentially concerned the right
of the Plaintiff to use certain outdoor areas, and for the ease
of convenience, these representations will be referred to as “the
Outdoor Space Representations”. The Plaintiff’s assertion is that
the Outdoor Space Representations were false, and on this basis,
it has brought a claim against the Defendant for relief under s
2 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed). In addition,
the Plaintiff has also brought a claim for breach of a collateral contract
(where the Defendant was said to have permitted the Plaintiff to use
the outdoor spaces) as well as a claim based on proprietary estoppel. Without
delving into the precise details and substantive merits of the main action,
the Plaintiff is essentially alleging that the space it was entitled
to use turned out to be much less than what they had been led to
believe. This, of course, is denied by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
second front advanced by the Plaintiff is the assertion that the Defendant
had committed a number of breaches in relation to the Lease Agreement:
namely, breach of an express and/or implied covenant in the Lease
Agreement that the Defendant possessed a leasehold interest in the Premises,
breach of an express term or covenant of the Lease Agreement that
the term of the Lease was to be for a period of six years, as well
as a general assertion of repudiatory breach of the Lease Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On
29 May 2013 the Plaintiff, by way of SUM 2743/2013, took out an application
for specific discovery of certain documents. Subject to some minor
variations, the AR on 25 July 2013 allowed the Plaintiff’s application. The
Defendant is now appealing against the decision of the AR. Before
I turn to the applicable legal principles, it will be helpful to
first set out the background to the dispute (insofar as it is relevant
to the claim for specific discovery) so as to provide the proper
context in which the application for specific discovery was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ pleaded case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In
its Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff asserts that prior to the conclusion
of the Lease Agreement, the Plaintiff and the Defendant were engaged
in negotiations on the commercial and legal terms of the lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> These negotiations were said to have
commenced in around March 2009 and were only concluded about a year
later. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant made a number of
representations during the course of negotiations concerning the
Plaintiff’s right, as tenant of the Premises, to use certain outdoor
spaces without further payment. The essence of the representations
was that the Plaintiff would have the use of the “biggest outdoor
area along the Marina Bay Sands Promenade”, which would “be able
to accommodate hundreds of customers drinking all the way to the waterfront
edge of the Promenade.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Outdoor Space Representations were
allegedly made both orally and in writing by a number of alleged agents
of the Defendant. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant induced the
Plaintiff to believe throughout the course of negotiations that
it had a right to use the outdoor space area around and at the front
of the Kiosk.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It was on the basis of these
Outdoor Space Representations that the Plaintiff entered into the
Agreement for Lease (and also the Lease itself) on 8 March 2010
and thereafter commenced design and fitting works for the establishment
of the South Coast Bar &amp; Bistro.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Subsequently
(between April and June 2010), the Plaintiff was informed by the
Defendant that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) had imposed
restrictions over the use of the outdoor spaces described as Outdoor
Areas A, B and C.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In mid-June 2010, the Defendant was
granted a Temporary Occupation Licence (“TOL”) to occupy Outdoor Areas
A and B on a monthly basis. The TOL did not allow the construction of
any pergolas or other cover over the outdoor seating areas. Later,
in November 2011, the Defendant instructed the Plaintiff to stop
using Outdoor Area B and to remove all outdoor furniture in that
area.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Finally, on or about
29 February 2012, the URA amended the TOL, limiting the area of
use that is subject to the TOL to just Outdoor Area A. The Plaintiff’s
case is that the Defendant never informed the Plaintiff during the
lease negotiations that URA approval was necessary for the Plaintiff’s
use and occupation of the outdoor areas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
Defendant denies most of the alleged representations and specifically
asserts in its Defence and Counterclaim dated 3 January 2013 that
the Plaintiff had been informed that its use of the outdoor areas
was subject to the approval of both the Defendant and the URA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Indeed, the Defendant asserts
that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the Plaintiff knew that The Shoppes at
Marina Bay Sands was a new development under construction and accordingly,
the lease of the Premises (including the conditions relating thereto)
would be subject to the approval of the Government of the Republic
of Singapore (the “State”) and/or relevant authorities. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The
Defendant is also relying on the Entire Agreement Clause in the Lease
Agreement to exclude any representations that may have been made in
the course of negotiations. This includes:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause
6.18.1 which states, <em>inter alia</em>,
that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The STB [Singapore Tourism Board] is seized
of the Land to be comprised in a State Lease (“Head Lease”) to be
issued in favour of the STB by the President of the Republic of
Singapore ... for a leasehold estate for an unexpired portion of
a term of 60 years…</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause
6.18.2 which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Landlord [Marina Bay Sands] has an
interest in the Land on which the Development is situated comprised
in a superior Lease granted or to be granted by the STB to the Landlord
...</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Clause
6.12.2 which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Landlord is not bound by any representations
or promises with respect to the Development or the Premises if they
are not stated in the Entire Agreement whether written or oral,
express or implied by common law, statute, or custom…</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     Clause
6.12.3 which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Tenant confirms that it has not agreed
to, or executed this Lease relying on any representations made by
the Landlord or on its behalf which is not stated in the Entire
Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Leaving
aside (for the moment) the claims brought in respect of the Outdoor
Space Representations, a number of connected issues arise in this case
concerning: (i) the right or title of the Defendant to enter into
the Lease Agreement (and the Lease) (“the Title Term”); and (ii)
the obligation to provide the Plaintiff with a lease of the Premises
for a period of six years (“the Duration Term”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Put
at its most basic, the Plaintiff claims that the Defendant did not
in fact possess the leasehold interest in the Premises at the time
when it signed the Lease Agreement with the Plaintiff<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> and that the Defendant had committed
an anticipatory breach of the Duration Term on 11 June 2012 when
the Plaintiff was informed by the Defendant that a <em>licence</em> for
Unit “#01-R7” [“#01-85”] would be issued for the remainder of the
term of the Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     With
respect to the claim that the Defendant had breached the express/implied
Title Term, the Plaintiff has made reference to the Development
Agreement (“DA”) between the Defendant and the Government of Singapore,
as well as the Head Lease and the Superior Lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> At this juncture, it is noted
that the DA was concluded between the Defendant and the Singapore
Tourism Board (“STB”). Whether the STB is to be regarded as the
Government or as having concluded the contract on behalf of the
Government is a matter in dispute. The Defendant denies any breach
of the express/implied Title Term and further asserts that the email communication
with the Plaintiff on 11 June 2012 was made in the context of an
agreement between both parties to restructure their relationship.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In brief, the Defendant asserts
that the Plaintiff was informed “in or around” 2010 that the Letter
of Offer and Lease might have to be amended as a result of the discussions
taking place between the Defendant and the URA. In February 2011,
it is said that the Plaintiff was informed that the parties may have
to execute new commercial documents. Subsequently, on around 23 May
2011, it is pleaded that the State and the Defendant had entered
into a licence agreement which contained the terms and conditions
governing the use of the waterfront promenade area (where the Promenade
Kiosk was located). This agreement was effective from 15 October
2010. In view of the State licence, the Defendant asserts that it
prepared documents to vary the terms of the Letter of Offer and
Lease Agreement, such that the Basement Kitchen would remain the
subject matter of a <em>lease</em>, whereas
the Promenade Kiosk would be the subject matter of a <em>licence</em> with effect from 3 December 2010.
These documents were said to have been delivered to the Plaintiff
(via email) on 11 June 2012. It is also claimed that the Plaintiff
had accepted and agreed to the variation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The hearing below – documents
requested by specific discovery and the decision of the AR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     SUM
2743/2013 was an application by the Plaintiff for specific discovery
pursuant to O 24 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
(“ROC”). The documents requested were set out in the Schedule to
the Summons and organised under nine categories. For convenience,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
Summons for specific discovery was heard by the AR on 17 July 2013.
The AR, at [4] of her oral judgment delivered on 25 July 2013, was
of the view that the documents sought to be discovered were relevant
to the proceedings between the parties. Indeed, the AR commented
that the requested documents were similar in nature to those already
disclosed by the Defendant in its List of Documents filed on 6 March
2013 and the Plaintiff’s List of Documents filed on 13 March 2013.
That being so, the AR rejected the Defendant’s arguments that were
largely based on irrelevance and failure by the Plaintiff to demonstrate
that the documents were in the possession, custody or power of the
Defendant. In this regard, the main issue before the AR concerned
the possible application of s 5 of the OSA to the documents covered
by categories 1(i) and 5 of the Schedule (as set out above in [15]).
 These concerned (in the main):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
DA between the Defendant and the STB;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     documents
relating to the Defendant’s efforts to obtain clearance from STB
to disclose the same; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     documents
evidencing that the URA had required the “surrender” of the Premises
as stated in the email from the Defendant to the Plaintiff dated
23 July 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     After
considering the submissions of both parties, the AR held (at [19])
that s 5 of the OSA did not apply and that in any case, there was
no evidence before the court to show that the documents were obtained
or given under official confidence. There was also no evidence from
any Government official that public interests would suffer if the
documents and correspondence were disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As
a result, the AR allowed the Plaintiff’s application (subject to
some minor amendments). The minor amendments concerned limiting
the meaning of the phrase “agent to the Defendant’s agents referred
to in the pleadings”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On
7 August 2013, the Defendant appealed against the whole of the AR’s
decision by way of Registrar’s Appeal No 275 of 2013 (“RA 275/2013”).
Shortly before the hearing of RA 275/2013, the Defendant informed
the Plaintiff and this court that it would only be proceeding with the
appeal in respect of categories 1(i) and 5 of the Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     RA
275/2013 was first heard by me on 9 September 2013. After hearing
the arguments and submissions of both parties, the matter was adjourned
for parties to prepare further submissions on the applicability
of the OSA and s 125 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) in
relation to the definition of the phrase “affairs of State”. The
hearing resumed on 8 November 2013 and I reserved judgment upon
the conclusion of the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Order
24 rule 5(1) of the ROC permits a party to apply for an order for
discovery of specific documents or a specific class of documents
within the possession, custody or power of another party. Discovery
will only be granted if the conditions set out in O 24 r 5(3) are
satisfied. In brief, this requires the document over which discovery
is sought to be one which could adversely affect his own case or
the case of another party or which might support another party’s
case. This includes documents that may lead to a “train of inquiry”
resulting in the obtaining of further information which may adversely
affect his own case or another party’s case or support another party’s
case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It
is noted that even if the requirements of O 24 r 5 are satisfied
by the applicant, the court still retains a discretion under O 24
r 7 to reject the application for discovery on the basis that it
is not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, or at all. <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2013</em> (G P Selvam gen
ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2013) explains at para 24/7/1 that
O 24 r 7 sets out the overriding principle that discovery must be
necessary for either the fair disposal of the matter or the saving
of costs. That said, once the applicant has established relevancy,
the burden lies on the respondent to demonstrate that discovery
is not necessary for the fair disposal of the matter, or for the
saving of costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
two issues before me are, therefore, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     First,
are the documents requested for relevant for the fair disposal of
the matter or the saving of costs? (“Issue 1”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
even if they are relevant, are the documents protected by the OSA
such that they should not be disclosed? (“Issue 2”)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1 – Relevance of the documents
requested</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Category
1(i) is essentially concerned with the DA signed by the Defendant
and the STB. The Plaintiff’s case is that the DA is relevant to
the issues that have arisen — in particular, the question as to
the nature of the interest which the Defendant possessed in respect
of the Premises and the assertion that the URA had required the
surrender of the Premises. In this respect, it will be recalled
that the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant includes the breach
of an express and/or implied Title Term in that the Defendant did
not in fact possess the requisite leasehold interest in the Premises
to conclude the Agreement for Lease and the Lease itself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, a claim is also made
for the anticipatory breach of the Duration Term by reason of the
issuance of a <em>licence</em> for the remainder
of the term with respect to Unit “#01-R7”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Insofar
as the DA between the Defendant and the STB is concerned, there
appears to be little doubt as to its relevance to the pleaded issues. Indeed,
it appears from the Defendant’s written submissions (on appeal) that
the crux of its argument in relation to the DA was not so much of
its relevance, but as to whether the DA was protected from discovery
by virtue of the OSA and other related arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On
the question of relevance, the position in respect of the documents evidencing
the efforts made by the Defendant to obtain clearance from STB is
far less clear. In this regard, the Defendant maintains the position
that these documents are not relevant to the pleaded issues. Counsel
for the Defendant submits that the arguments made by the Plaintiff
before the AR only concerned relevance in relation to the DA and
not relevance with regard to the Defendant’s efforts to obtain clearance.
Looking at the matter afresh, it is not immediately apparent to
this court as to how the documents relating to the Defendant’s efforts
to obtain clearance are relevant or indeed, if relevant, why it
is necessary for these documents to be disclosed at this stage of
the proceedings for either the fair disposal of the matter or the saving
of costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
any event, at the hearing before me on 9 September 2013, the Plaintiff
stated that it was no longer pursuing the discovery of documents relating
to the efforts made by the Defendant to obtain clearance from the STB,
but that this was without prejudice to their right to file a fresh application
for specific discovery of the same at a later stage in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I
turn now to consider the issue of relevance in relation to the documents
evidencing that the URA had required the “surrender” of the Premises
as stated in the email dated 23 July 2012 (“URA Surrender Documents”)
from the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Leaving
aside possible objections on the grounds of the OSA and other related
arguments, the relevance and necessity for disclosing the URA Surrender
Documents is contested by the Defendant. In the first place, counsel
for the Defendant submits that the Plaintiff merely made a bare assertion
that the documents were in the Defendant’s possession, custody or
power. In any case, the Defendant points out that it had already informed
the Plaintiff by way of a letter dated 9 May 2013 that save for
the Request for Proposal and the DA, there are no further documents evidencing
URA’s request for the Premises to be surrendered. In this regard,
the Defendant adds that the application for the discovery of the URA
Surrender Documents was no more than a “fishing expedition”, especially
in light of the broad terms in which the order was sought: all communications
between the Defendant’s employees, the Defendant and its agents(s),
the Defendant and the URA whether directly or through agent(s) of
the Defendant and the Defendant and <em>other parties</em> whether directly
or through agent(s) of the Defendant. It was for this reason (as described
in the Defendant’s written submissions) that the AR limited the scope
of discovery under this category to documents with the URA, the Defendant’s
employees, and their respective agents as specified in the pleadings.
The AR declined to order discovery with respect to the documents
with “other parties.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Given
the clear statement by the Defendant that it does not have any other
documents relating to the URA Surrender Documents and the absence
of any evidence to the contrary, the documents under this category are
(at least for the time being) confined to the DA and the Request
for Proposal. The DA is also a document sought under Category 1(i)
and the main objection that remains is the claim for protection
under the OSA and other related arguments. The Request for Proposal
(which appears to be a document that predates and relates to the
DA) is similarly subject to a claim for privilege under the OSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2 – The Development Agreement

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Section

to his desire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
case for the Defendant, put simply, is that the DA signed by the Defendant
and the STB is a document that falls within s 5(1) of the OSA and
that the Defendant obtained the document as a person who holds a contract
made on behalf of the Government or any specified organisation. That
being so, the Defendant asserts that disclosure of the DA by the Defendant
to the Plaintiff will be an offence by virtue of s 5(1)(e) and (i)
of the OSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It
is clear that for s 5(1)(e) to apply, it is necessary to establish
the following elements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     Possession
or control of (i) any secret official code word, countersign or
password or (ii) any photograph, drawing, plan, model, article,
note, document or information (“the Protected Material”);, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
the person with possession or control, had obtained or has had access
to the Protected Material owing to his position as a person who
holds or has held office under the Government, or as a person who
holds, or has held a contract made on behalf of the Government or
any specified organisation, or as a person who is or has been employed
under a person who holds or has held such an office or contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant protected material</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Bridges Christopher</em> [1997]
3 SLR(R) 467 (“<em>Bridges</em>”), the respondent,
a lawyer, was convicted by the District Court of six charges under
the OSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
first group of three charges was for offences under s 5(2) of the OSA,
while the second group of three charges was for offences under s 5(1)(c)(i)
of the OSA. All six charges arose from the fact that the respondent
had received, from a Police Staff Sergeant in the Criminal Investigation
Department (“the PSS”), information as to the change of addresses
of certain persons who were named in the charges. These persons were
individuals with whom another lawyer (a friend and relative of the respondent)
was having problems serving court documents on account that they
had changed their addresses. On three different occasions, the other lawyer
requested the respondent’s assistance to determine the latest addresses
of four individuals. The respondent was able to obtain and supply the
information as requested to the lawyer/friend. At the trial, it
was not disputed that the respondent had obtained the information
from the PSS. What was unclear was how the PSS had obtained the
updated addresses. There were a number of possibilities: (i) The
information could have been obtained by the PSS from the National
Registration Office’s on-line system with the assistance of an analyst
team. This on-line system was secret and could not be accessed by
members of the public. (ii) From the Registry of Vehicles, provided
the car licence plate number was known. (iii) From the Registry
of Land Titles and Deeds by way of a title search of the property with
the mukim, lot number or address. (iv) By searching (which is said
to be a laborious process) the 1992 electoral registers. (v) With
the assistance of private search agencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The
High Court quashed the convictions on the basis that the Prosecution
had failed to prove that the information relating to the change of
addresses was or had been “secret official” and because the Prosecution had
not established even a <em>prima facie</em> case
that the information was official information protected by the OSA.
The High Court also found that the respondent lacked the necessary <em>mens rea</em> required to establish an offence under
s 5(2) and s 5(1)(c)(i) of the OSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Following
the High Court judgment, the Public Prosecutor applied under s 60
of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1985 Rev Ed) to
reserve eight questions of law of public interest for the Court
of Appeal (subsequently recast into six questions by the High Court).
One question raised was whether information that has been published,
released or made available to the public by a person authorised
to do so nevertheless remains information falling within s 5 of
the OSA. On this, M Karthigesu JA (delivering the judgment for the
Court of Appeal) held (at [35]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a matter of construction the collocation
of words in s 5(1) of the Act logically fall into two groups: “any
secret official code word, countersign or password” is one group
(“the first group”) and the other group is, “any photograph, drawing,
plan, model, article, note, document or information” (“the second
group)”. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The
important point that follows is that items in the second group do not
necessarily have to be “secret official” in order to fall within
s 5(1) of the OSA. Whether items in the second group fall within
s 5(1) depends on whether one or more of sub-paragraphs (a)–(e)
are applicable. One example illustrating the operation of s 5(1)
and the second group given by the Court of Appeal was a photograph.
In order for a photograph to be covered under the OSA, it does not
have to be a “secret official” photograph as such. Whether s 5(1)
applies depends on whether one or more of the sub-paragraphs apply.
For example, a photograph of a military camp would be covered not
because it is “secret official” but because it “relates to … a prohibited
place” (assuming that the military camp in question is a prohibited
place). If so, the photograph will fall within s 5(1)(a). Where
an item within the second group falls within one or more of the
sub-paragraphs (a)–(e), an offence will have been committed if the
item (<em>eg</em>, a photograph) was used
in one of the ways specified in paragraphs (i)–(iv) of s 5(1) (with
the requisite <em>mens rea</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It
follows that in the present case, in order for s 5(1) of the OSA
to apply, it is necessary to show that the DA (which is essentially
a document) is caught by one or more of sub-paragraphs (a)–(e) of
s 5(1). In this case, the relevant sub-paragraph is (e).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Before
I turn to consider the parties’ submissions on sub-paragraph (e),
it will be convenient to first deal with a point of law that has
arisen in connection with s 5(1) as a whole. This concerns whether
information that is already in the public domain can be the subject
matter of a charge under s 5 of the OSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Information in the public domain</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In
the <em>Bridges</em> decision, M Karthigesu
JA at [39] postulates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Information may be in the public domain
(a) because its knowledge is universal like “the sun rises in the
east”; or (b) information initially “protected” by s 5 being information
which a public servant learns in the course of his public or official
duty entering the public domain by the authority of the appropriate
government authority. As the Public Prosecutor says the Act does
not apply to this kind of information. Information which indisputedly
[<em>sic</em>] is already in the public domain
could never be <em>obtained in contravention of
the Act</em>. An essential ingredient of the offence would
always be lacking. The same applies to information initially “protected”
by the Act entering the public domain. The former category of information
because of its universality belies proof while information in the
latter category raises a question of fact to be proved or disproved.
Even the poster advertising beer with a photograph of a swimsuit
clad model … would not be a photograph “protected” under s 5(1)(a)
simply because it is used as decoration in the mess of an army camp.
It must be shown to <em>relate to or that it was
used in a prohibited place</em> or anything in such a place
… which is a matter of proof, the onus of which is on the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The
respondent in <em>Bridges</em> was prosecuted
for an offence under s 5(2) of the OSA for receiving information
knowing or having reasonable ground to believe that, at the time
when he received it, the information was communicated to him in
contravention of the OSA. It followed that, to succeed, the Prosecution
would have to first prove that the communication by the PSS to the
respondent was “in contravention of the Act”. This would require
showing that the communication by the PSS was itself caught under s 5(1)(d)
or (e) read together with s 5(1)(i) of the OSA. In short, as M Karthigesu
JA held at [40], this would require proof that the PSS had (i) obtained
the information from an official government source in his capacity
as a field intelligence officer; and (ii) communicated the information
to the respondent, a person to whom the PSS was not authorised to
communicate it to (or to whom it was not his duty to communicate
it). If so, the PSS would have committed an offence under s 5(1)
of the OSA. The liability of the PSS in this way would be that of
a “giver” of the information. The liability of the respondent, if
any, was that of a “receiver” under s 5(2). This would require proof
of not only receipt, but specifically receipt with the necessary <em>mens rea</em> (knowing or having reasonable
grounds to believe that the communication was in contravention of
the OSA).  On the evidence, the Court of Appeal held (at [44]) that
the Prosecution had failed to prove that the respondent had reasonable
grounds to believe that the information given to him was “protected”
information. Thus, it was said that “this vital element in the ingredient
of the <em>mens rea</em> required to be proved
by the Prosecution was not <em>prima facie</em> proved”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The
respondent in <em>Bridges</em> was also prosecuted
for an offence under s 5(1)(c)(i) for having himself communicated
the information to the “other lawyer”. This also required proof
of the necessary <em>mens rea</em>: knowledge
that the information had been obtained by the respondent in contravention
of the OSA and knowledge that he had no authority or duty to communicate the
information to the “other lawyer”. By “protected information”, the Court
of Appeal meant that the information “was <em>obtained</em> by
the communicator in contravention of the Act and that it was <em>communicated</em> to another in contravention
of the Act”. It was in this context that M Karthigesu JA at [45]
commented that “mere possession of the ‘protected’ information …
does not constitute an offence”. It is very likely that this is also
the context in which Question 1(b) of the criminal reference was answered.
That question, it will be recalled, asks whether:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… information that has been published,
released or made available to the public by a person authorised
to do so nevertheless remain information falling within s 5 of the
OSA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
“negative” answer given by the Court of Appeal at [60] must be understood
in this context. The statement by the Court of Appeal at [39] was
that information in the public domain (such as the fact that the
sun always rises in the east) could never be obtained in contravention
of the OSA. Given that such information could be obtained from a
myriad of public sources (or what is commonly referred to as “general
knowledge”), how could the Prosecution ever prove that the information
had been obtained in contravention of the OSA? In such cases, as
M Karthigesu JA stated at [39], the universality of the information
in such a case belies proof. The position in other cases where the
information was initially protected but which had subsequently become
public knowledge was different in that the Prosecution might still
be able to establish the necessary elements laid out in s 5(1)(a)–(e)
and s 5(2). The example given was the use of a photograph depicting
a swimsuit model as a decoration in an army camp. The Prosecution
would have to prove that the information (<em>ie</em>,
the poster and depicted images) was covered by one of the limbs
under s 5(1), such as information which “relates to or is used in
a prohibited place”. If so, the information could still be “protected”
in the sense of falling within s 5(1)(a)–(e) and an offence could
still be made out under s 5(1)(i) or s 5(2), subject to the requisite <em>mens rea</em> being established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In
the present case, the Plaintiff claimed that it was able to obtain (what <em>they</em> stated seemed to be) a copy of the
DA (as well as a copy of the Supplemental Agreement to the DA dated
11 August 2009) by way of an online Internet search. As deposed
at para 9 of Aaron Joseph Kearney’s affidavit filed on behalf of
the Plaintiff on 25 June 2013 (“AJK-1”), the contents of the agreements
were also said to have been disclosed in Las Vegas Sands Corporation’s
Annual Report for 2011 (“2011 Annual Report”). In reply, the Defendant
has explained (at para 8 of the affidavit filed by Fang Fu-Cun Kevin
on behalf of the Defendant on 10 July 2013) that the “limited disclosure”
was required by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
and any disclosure was for this purpose only. Whilst there may be
some uncertainty as to whether the online copies that the Plaintiff
has been able to locate are accurate copies of the DA, there is no
doubt that the online searches were conducted using standard Internet search
engines. For the avoidance of doubt, this court notes that there
is no suggestion that the online searches were improper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Where
information has been made available on the Internet, a serious question
arises as to whether the information remains “confidential” or whether
it has entered the public domain so far as the law of confidence
is concerned. In the context of the equitable action to protect
confidential information, once information is readily accessible
to members of the public, the information will lack the necessary
quality of confidence that is required to support the claim. Even
where the publication of information is in an overseas jurisdiction,
it does not mean that the court is prevented from finding that the
information has entered into the public domain within the jurisdiction.
See <em>eg</em>, <em>Franchi
v Franchi</em> [1967] RPC 149, and generally <em>Attorney-General
v Guardian Newspapers Ltd and Others</em> [1987] 1 WLR 1248
and <em>Attorney-General v Observer Ltd and Others</em> [1990]
1 AC 109. See also the helpful commentary, Ng Siew Kuan, “The Spycatcher
Saga: Its Implications and Effect on the Law of Confidence” (1990)
32 Mal LR 1. In the modern information age of the Internet and the
World Wide Web, news originating locally may rapidly become international
news in a short period of time. Where members of the public in Singapore
are able to (lawfully) access a foreign hosted website and locate
uploaded information, serious difficulties will arise in sustaining
any claim to confidentiality, although this will still depend largely
on the circumstances of each case, including how readily accessible
the website is to the public. It does not, however, follow that
such information loses any protection that it might have enjoyed
under the OSA. Information to be protected under the OSA does not
have to be confidential information as such. Indeed, leaving aside matters
of universal general knowledge such as the sun rising in the east,
it is clear from <em>Bridges</em> that information
which has become publicly accessible may still be protected under
s 5(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In
this respect, much will depend on the basis on which s 5(1) is said to
apply. Under s 5(1)(e), the OSA applies to any document or information which
a person has obtained owing to his position as someone who holds
or has held a contract made on behalf of the Government or any specified organisation.
There is no requirement that the document or information has to
be of a confidential (let alone secret) nature. If the document
or information can be proved to fall within s 5(1)(e), the person
who has possession or control commits an offence under s 5(1)(i)
if he communicates the document or information to a person to whom
he is not authorised to communicate or to whom he has no duty to
communicate. Assuming that s 5(1) does apply to the DA, the Defendant’s
position is that it cannot be compelled to grant discovery to the
Plaintiff without the consent (<em>ie</em>,
authorisation) of the Government or the specified organisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The
question to be addressed is whether s 5(1) applies to the DA. This depends
not so much on whether the DA is confidential, secret or publicly available
by means of appropriate Internet searches, but whether the Defendant
is a person who had obtained the DA owing to his position as someone
who held a contract made on behalf of the Government or any specified
organisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     There
is no dispute that the DA was entered into between the Defendant
and the STB. It is also not disputed that the Defendant obtained possession
of its copy of the DA as a result of the contract. The key issue
is whether the contract was made by or on behalf of the Government
or any specified organisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The
term “Government” is not expressly defined in the OSA. Section 2
of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) simply defines it
as meaning “the Government of Singapore”.  The Online Oxford Dictionary defines
government as “the group of people with the authority to govern
a country or state; a particular ministry in office”. On the other
hand, the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines it as including:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5 a : the organization, machinery, or agency
through which a political unit exercises authority and performs
functions and which is usually classified according to the distribution
of power within it</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b : the complex of political institutions,
laws, and customs through which the function of governing is carried
out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The
STB is a statutory board set up pursuant to the Singapore Tourism
Board Act (Cap 305B, 1997 Rev Ed) (“STB Act”). The present STB Act
dates back to the Tourist Board Ordinance 1963 (Ordinance 35 of 1963).
The functions of the STB are broadly set out in s 7, of which the relevant
portions provide that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Functions
of Board</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>7.</b>—(1) The functions of the
Board shall be —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    to
develop and promote Singapore as a travel and tourist destination;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    to advise the Government on matters
relating to travel and tourism;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    to
exercise licensing and regulatory functions in respect of such tourism
enterprises as the Board may determine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The
powers of the STB are set out in s 8, of which the relevant portions
provide that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Powers

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>8</b>. Subject to this Act, the
Board may carry on such activities as appear to the Board to be
advantageous, necessary or convenient for it to carry on for or
in connection with the discharge of its functions and duties under
this Act and, in particular, the Board may exercise the following
powers:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    to
act as an agent for the Government or, with approval of the Minister,
for any person, body or organisation for the transaction of any
business connected with the tourism enterprise;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(g)    to
acquire, take on lease, hire, hold and enjoy movable and immovable
property and to convey, assign, surrender, charge, mortgage, demise,
transfer or otherwise dispose of, or deal with, any movable or immovable
property belonging to the Board upon such terms as the Board considers
fit;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    to
enter into any contract or agreement for carrying out the purposes
of this Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Tourism
enterprise is defined in s 2 as including any other undertaking
“including any convention, exhibition, show, fair, publicity campaign
or theme park, intended wholly or in part for the benefit of, or
for the purpose of attracting, visitors to Singapore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The
STB is run by a Board comprising the Chairman, the Chief Executive
and 10 other members appointed by the Minister. Other examples of
statutory boards in Singapore include the Civil Aviation Authority
of Singapore, the Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore, the Intellectual
Property Office of Singapore, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, the TCM Practitioners
Board and the URA. Former statutory boards which have since been
corporatised include the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Prior
to its amendment in 2001, s 5(1)(e) of the OSA did not include the
reference to “specified organisation”. Instead, the provision simply applied
to cases where the person held a contract made on behalf of the Government.
 The problem with the pre-amendment provision was that with the
ever increasing number of statutory bodies being set up in Singapore
(covering numerous areas of activity ranging from education to transport
and beyond), the question was bound to arise in respect of the extent
to which the provisions of the OSA were applicable to these statutory boards,
including cases where the statutory board had entered into contractual
arrangements with other persons. This appears to have been the problem
which prompted the Government to table the Official Secrets (Amendment)
Bill in Parliament in 2001 so as to extend the OSA to expressly
cover statutory boards as listed in the Schedule to the OSA.  The background
considerations which led to the 2001 amendments are important, and
they were addressed by the then Minister of State for Home Affairs,
Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, as set out in <em>Singapore Parliamentary
Debates, Official Report</em> (25 July 2001) vol 73 at cols 1934–1936
(Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Home Affairs):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, the Official Secrets Act (OSA) guards
against disclosure of official documents and information as this
can be detrimental to national and public interest. It is with this
objective that I am presenting this Bill today.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, increasingly, many governmental functions
have been devolved to statutory bodies. This ensures that the public
sector continues to remain nimble and responsive to challenges of
the future. This also allows statutory bodies to have greater flexibility
to compete in the recruitment of professional talent by tapping
external expertise from either local or overseas organisations.
With the greater flexibility, statutory bodies will better harness their
professional capabilities and concentrate on developing their core competencies,
whilst the Ministries focus on the core functions of policy planning
and resource allocation …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, this devolution of functions results
in officers in these statutory bodies having access to official
information. This is inevitable as the officers require this information
to discharge their functions properly and effectively. The OSA currently
only covers Ministries. To ensure that the provisions of the OSA
continue to cover these officers, it is necessary to extend the
scope of the Act to include selective statutory bodies. Prior to
conversion into a statutory body, such information would have been
handled by the officers as Ministry officials and therefore covered
under the OSA. Hence, what this Bill essentially does is to restore
the position to what it was before the formation of the statutory
bodies. It also extends coverage to new matters that the designated
statutory bodies may cover. There is thus no change to the substantive
scope of the OSA’s provisions. Currently, some of these selected statutory
bodies are covered by the statutory bodies and Government companies’
Protection of Secrecy Act (PSA) but the scope of PSA is narrower than
the OSA. This is not satisfactory in so far as official information
vital to national security and national interest is concerned. Hence
these selected statutory bodies are now placed under the OSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bill proposes to amend the OSA by introducing
a Schedule of Organisations comprising selected statutory bodies
and DSO National Laboratories to be protected under the OSA. In
this way, the provisions relating to wrongful communication of information,
falsification of reports, forgery, personation and possession of
false documents will apply to these organisations. The President
can amend this Schedule from time to time by notification in the
Gazette.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, MHA has consulted all the Ministries
to identify the statutory bodies under their charge that handle
official information vital to national security or national interest.
…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, with these amendments, we aim to ensure
that official information continues to be properly protected and
managed. This can only be for Singapore’s good.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     At
the date of the proceedings, the Schedule sets out a list of 28 statutory
boards. These are the Building and Construction Authority; Casino
Regulatory Authority of Singapore; Central Provident Fund Board; Civil
Aviation Authority of Singapore; Civil Service College; Competition Commission
of Singapore; Council for Private Education; Defence Science and
Technology Agency; DSO National Laboratories; Economic Development
Board; Energy Market Authority of Singapore; Government of Singapore
Investment Corporation Private Limited and its subsidiary corporations;
Housing and Development Board; Info-communications Development Authority
of Singapore; Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore; International
Enterprise Singapore Board; Jurong Town Corporation; Land Transport
Authority of Singapore; Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore;
Media Development Authority of Singapore; Monetary Authority of
Singapore; National Environment Agency; National Heritage Board;
Public Utilities Board; Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board;
Singapore Land Authority; Singapore Workforce Development Agency
and the URA. It is to be noted that there are more than 40 statutory
boards in Singapore and the STB is not one of those named in the
Schedule. Given the remarks made by the Minister and the extensive
list of statutory boards set out in the Schedule, the “omission”
of the STB from the Schedule must have been a matter on which there
had been deliberation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Indeed,
it is to be noted that the STB is listed in the Schedule to the Statutory
Bodies and Government Companies (Protection of Secrecy) Act (Cap
319, 2004 Rev Ed) (“PSA”). The PSA is an Act enacted in 1983 to protect
the “secrecy of information of statutory bodies and Government companies”.
The PSA protects any secret or confidential document or information
obtained by virtue of a person’s position as a member, officer, employee
or agent of any organisation specified in the Schedule. The STB, together
with the URA, is listed in the Schedule to the PSA (together with some
30 other statutory boards). Thus, I am unable to accept the Defendant’s
submission that even though the STB is not listed as a specified organisation
in the Schedule to the OSA, it can nonetheless still be included simply
on the basis that it is part of the Government. Such an interpretation is
not consistent with the legislative history of the relevant provisions
and would render the 2001 amendments otiose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The
Defendant’s argument on the OSA in this appeal did not, however,
rest solely on the submission that the reference to Government included
the STB. In addition, another point was raised to the effect that
s 5(1) is applicable if the contract in question (<em>ie</em>,
the DA) was made by the STB <em>on behalf</em> of
the Government. It is this argument that I now turn to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the STB enter the contract
on behalf of the Government?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Under
the STB Act, s 3(2) provides that the STB is a “body corporate” possessing
the power to sue and be sued in its corporate name, and to perform
all the acts which bodies corporate may by law perform. In carrying
out and discharging its functions and duties, s 8(a) provides that the
Board “may”, <em>inter alia</em>, “act as
agent for the Government” in relation to the “transaction of any
business connected with any tourism enterprise”. Other powers conferred
on the STB under s 8 include (under sub-paragraph (i)) the power
“to enter into any contract or agreement for carrying out the purposes
of [the] Act”. The Plaintiff rightly submitted that whilst the STB <em>may</em> act as an agent for the Government,
it does not necessarily follow that in <em>all
cases</em>, the STB enters into commercial contracts/arrangements
as an agent for or on behalf of the Government. Any assumption that
the STB <em>always</em> acts on behalf of
the Government does not sit easily with s 8 and the broader rationale
of devolving power and responsibility to the statutory boards so
as to allow them to be nimble and responsive in the face of new
challenges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In
the present case, the STB is not a party to the proceedings. The Plaintiff
rightly draws the court’s attention to the fact that no affidavit
has been filed by the STB confirming their position on the DA and
in particular, whether the DA was entered into on behalf of the
Government. That said, the Defendant did, during the appeal hearing,
produce a letter to the court from the STB objecting to the disclosure
of the DA. The Plaintiff was, however, not given sight of the letter
and the position remains that there is no affidavit from the STB
as to its position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     On
this point, counsel for the Plaintiff referred the court to the
Court of Appeal decision of <em>Zainal bin Kuning
and others v Chan Sin Mian </em><em>Michael
and another</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 858 (“<em>Zainal</em>”).
This was a case where the appellants had sued the respondents for
wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution. An issue arose as to
whether the trial judge had properly refused to grant their application
for specific discovery of certain documents reflecting communications
between the first respondent (a police inspector attached to the
Criminal Investigation Department) and the Deputy Public Prosecutor.
Section 126 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Rev Ed) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No public officer shall be compelled to
disclose communications made to him in official confidence when
he considers that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On
the facts, L P Thean JA, in delivering the judgment of the court, noted
(at [33]) that affidavits had been sworn or affirmed by the officer
in charge of the case, the Deputy Public Prosecutor and the Attorney-General to
the effect that the documents sought were given or received as part
of the official duties of the officers concerned and that public
interest would suffer by the disclosure of these communications
made to them in official confidence. For this reason, Thean JA held
that the trial judge was fully justified in refusing to grant discovery
of the documents. It bears noting that <em>Zainal</em> did
not concern s 5(1) of the OSA.  Nevertheless, the Plaintiff raises
the point that a similar approach might be taken in relation to
s 5(1). If a claim for “privilege” is raised on the basis that the
STB had entered into the DA <em>on behalf of </em><em>the Government</em>, the burden falls on the
Defendant to establish that this was in fact the position. No affidavit
had been filed by any representative of the STB or the Government.
Indeed, the Plaintiff has pointed out that no affidavit was filed
to explain why the disclosure of the contents of the DA (and the
Request for Proposal) would be injurious to the public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As
noted above, the Plaintiff, by way of AJK-1, asserts that in any event,
they have been able to obtain a copy of the DA dated 11 December 2009
(and the Supplemental Agreement). The contents of the agreements were
also disclosed in the 2011 Annual Report. Copies of both agreements were
also attached as exhibits to AJK-1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I
make the following brief comments on these exhibits. First, the
2011 Annual Report sets out a summary of the DA with the STB, which
runs into some eleven (main) paragraphs and a number of subsidiary
paragraphs as well. The opening sentence states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On August 23, 2006, our wholly owned subsidiary,
Marina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. (“MBS”), entered into a development agreement,
as amended by a supplementary agreement on December 11, 2009 (the
“Development Agreement”) with the STB to design, develop, construct
and operate the Marina Bay Sands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Further
down the summary, it is also stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the terms of the Development Agreement,
MBS agreed to design, develop and construct the integrated resort
in accordance with the plans set forth in its response to the Request
for Proposal, which was accepted by the STB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The
2011 Annual Report does not set out the actual DA, the Supplemental
Agreement or the Request for Proposal. That said, it is noted that
Part IV of the 2011 Annual Report (<em>ie</em>,
Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules) refers to the DA and
the Supplemental Agreement to the DA in the list of exhibits. Moreover,
the copy of the DA (and the Supplemental Agreement) exhibited in
AJK-1 appears to be extracted from an online website. Whether the
copy extracted is a true and accurate copy of the actual DA and
the Supplemental Agreement is not clear, given that neither the
Defendant nor the STB has confirmed the authenticity of the documents
in question. I, therefore, confine my further comments on the STB
and the DA (as well as the Supplemental Agreement) to what is set
out in the 2011 Annual Report. Bearing in mind that the 2011 Annual
Report only provides a summary of the agreements (although it does
appear that the actual agreements were referred to in the list of
exhibits), there is no express indication that the STB was entering
into the agreements on behalf of the Government. The 2011 Annual
Report does, however, refer to the fact that under the DA, the Defendant
was required to be licensed by the relevant gaming authorities before
it could actually commence operating the casino under the casino
concession. The 2011 Annual Report also sets out the term (duration)
of the casino concession provided for under the DA and goes on to
state that “the Singapore Government may terminate the casino concession
prior to its expiration in order to serve the best interests of
the public, in which event fair compensation will be paid to MBS.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It
is the Defendant who advances the argument that the agreements between
the Defendant and the STB were entered into by the STB on behalf of
the Government and that accordingly, the Defendant is to be regarded
as a person who has held a contract made on behalf of the Government
so as to bring it within s 5(1)(e) of the OSA. The Defendant does
not appear to deny the relevance of the DA (and the Supplemental
Agreement). Instead, the Defendant’s argument against discovery
is predicated on the assertion that it is unable to disclose the
documents as this would amount to an offence under s 5(1)(i) of
the OSA. In these circumstances and based on the material before
the court, I find that the Defendant has not established that the
agreements were entered into by the STB on behalf of the Government. In
saying this, the court does take note of the Defendant’s written submissions
that the “Defendant has confirmed on affidavit that the Development
Agreement was issued to the Defendant by the STB on behalf of the
Government”. This may well be so. Nevertheless, the fact that the STB
could have entered into the contract on behalf of the Government
is not enough to establish that this was in fact the case. In coming
to this view, I also note that the Defendant has stated in its written
submissions that the STB had confirmed that it is not agreeable
to the disclosure of the DA and the Supplemental Agreement for the
purposes of the present proceedings. The point remains that there
is no affidavit from the STB in these proceedings to set out its
position. Neither has there been any attempt by the STB to intervene
so as to formally record its objections. The fact that the court
was shown a letter indicating the STB’s objection has been referred
to above. The letter has not been exhibited in any affidavit before
the court and indeed, it appears that the Plaintiff has not even
seen the letter and was thus unable to respond. On the other hand,
it appears that the AR was given sight of the STB letter. This led
the AR to state, at [6] of her decision, that “both the STB and
the URA declined to give consent”. In these circumstances, based
on the material placed before me in the current proceedings, this
court is not satisfied that the Defendant has established that the
DA was entered into by the STB on behalf of the Singapore Government.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence as to affairs of State</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I
turn now to consider the next ground upon which the Defendant has
relied on to resist discovery of the DA, which is that the DA is
evidence as to affairs of State.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Section
125 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No one shall be permitted to produce any
unpublished official record relating to affairs of State, or to
give any evidence derived therefrom, except with permission of the
officer at the head of the Department concerned, who shall give
or withhold such permission as he thinks fit, subject, however,
to the control of the Minister.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In
order to succeed, it is clear that the Defendant would have to show, <em>inter alia</em>, that the document in question
was (i) unpublished, (ii) an official record, and (iii) that it
related to affairs of State. Even if it is accepted that the DA
has not yet been published (notwithstanding the permitted referral and
exposure of the agreement in the 2011 Annual Report), it is still necessary
to demonstrate that the DA is an “official record” which relates
to “affairs of State”. It is the latter term to which I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The
Defendant submits that the concept embodied by the term clearly covers
any document protected by the official secrets legislation, citing Jeffrey
Pinsler, <em>Singapore Court Practice</em> (LexisNexis,
2009) at p 655, where it is stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Clearly, it covers documents protected
by ‘official secrets’ legislation (see s 5 of the Official Secrets
Act), documents relating to public security such as national defence
… and confidential government documents including cabinet minutes,
policy documents and documents the disclosure of which would be
detrimental to foreign relations …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The
assertion that an “affair of State” covers any document that is protected
under s 5 of the OSA, whilst understandable, calls for closer examination.
Section 5 of the OSA is a complex provision which is capable of
covering a very wide variety of material. As discussed above, care
is needed before a conclusion can be drawn as to whether any document
or information is protected material. In the present case, the Defendant
argues that the DA signed by the Defendant and the STB is a document
that falls within s 5(1) and that the Defendant obtained the document
as a person who holds a contract made on behalf of the Government
or any specified organisation. That being so, the Defendant asserts
that its disclosure of the DA to the Plaintiff will amount to an
offence under s 5(1)(e) and s 5(1)(i) of the OSA. It follows that
since this court is not satisfied that the DA was indeed signed
by the STB on behalf of the Government, the Defendant cannot gain
any mileage on the basis of the submission that any document falling
within s 5 of the OSA must be taken to relate to an “affair of State”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The
Defendant has also relied on a number of case authorities in support
of its argument on how “affairs of State” ought to be construed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The
first is <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin and others v
Public Prosecutor</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 209 (“<em>Colin
Chan</em>”). In this case, Yong Pung How CJ refused to order
the production of certain files and documents of various Ministries
due to the importance of protecting the confidentiality of state papers.
 This case concerned convictions under the Undesirable Publications
Act (Cap 338, 1985 Rev Ed) in respect of certain publications by
the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. These publications were
the subject of Gazette Notifications. One of the issues that arose
in the appeal concerned the production of files and documents of
the relevant Ministries relating to the Gazette Notifications. It
was in this context that Yong CJ remarked (at [40]) that, quite
apart from s 125, he “was not convinced ... that the public interest
dictated that such documents be produced before this court” and
that the “importance of preserving the confidentiality of state
papers need not be stressed”.  The present case is clearly different
from the facts in <em>Colin Chan</em> and
thus provides little support for the Defendant’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The
second case is <em>Re Siah Mooi </em><em>Guat</em> [1988] 2 SLR(R) 165, which was cited
for the proposition that in cases turning on s 125, it was for the Minister,
and not the court, to decide whether it was in the public interest for
certain information to be disclosed. That case concerned an application by
a foreigner for an order of <em>certiorari</em> to
quash the decision that revoked her re-entry permit and employment
pass. T S Sinnathuray J (at [36]) states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It is laid in the second affidavit
for the Minister that he had considered information from a reliable
source on the applicant’s conduct and activities, and that he was
of the view that the information, if disclosed, would endanger the
confidentiality of the source and that would not be in the public
interest. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     It
was in this context that the learned judge held (at [36]) that it
was for the Minister, and not the court, to decide whether it was
in the public interest that the information should be disclosed.
Again, the facts and circumstances of <em>Siah
Mooi </em><em>Guat</em> are rather
different from the case at hand. In the first place, the confidentiality
of the information in the DA must be affected by the (consensual)
exposure in the 2011 Annual Report. Second, it is by no means clear
that the DA does relate to an “affair of State”. Moreover, there
is no affidavit by the STB or the Minister before the court on “affair
of State” or the general public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In
addition to the above cases, the Defendant also referred this court to
a number of foreign authorities: <em>B A Rao &amp;
Ors v Sapuran Kaur &amp; Anor</em> [1978] 2 MLJ 146 (“<em>B A Rao</em>”); <em>Wix Corporation
South East Asia Sdn </em><em>Bhd v Minister
for Labour and Manpower &amp; Ors</em> [1980] 1 MLJ 224 (“<em>Wix Corporation</em>”) and <em>The
Life Insurance Corporation of India v B B </em><em>Singla &amp; Ors</em> Civil Revision No 2475
of 2008 (“<em>Life Insurance Corporation</em>”).
The first two are decisions on s 123 of the Malaysian Evidence Act
1950. Both were cited for the general proposition that (i) the term,
“affair of State”, was not defined in the Evidence Act because its
existence would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case;
and (ii) that it was for the court to decide whether there was a
basis for the claim to “affair of State”. In <em>B
A Rao</em>, the Federal Court of Malaysia held that a report
of a Committee of Inquiry into a death at a hospital was not an
affair of State. In <em>Wix Corporation</em>,
the Malaysian court found that a report by the Director General
of Industrial Relations (relating to an employment dispute) was
not an affair of State. Finally, <em>Life Insurance
Corporation</em> was an Indian case from the High Court of
Punjab and Haryana on s 123 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, where
it was held that an annual confidential report of an employee did
not attract the privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The
Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the DA and lease arrangements
were strictly commercial transactions and that the disclosure of
the same could not be said to be detrimental to national and public interests.
The Plaintiff points out that this assertion is consistent with
the Defendant’s own disclosure of the DA and/or its contents in
its annual reports – this is so even if that disclosure was for
the purposes of complying with the requirements of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission. Cases cited by the Plaintiff
in support of its argument that commercial transactions or dealings
(even those entered into by the Government) were not necessarily
privileged as being an “affair of State” (whose disclosure is injurious
to the public interest) included <em>Burmah Oil Co
Ltd v Governor and Company of the Bank of England and Another</em> [1980] AC
1090, <em>Robinson v State of South Australia (No
2)</em> [1931] AC 704 and <em>Wix Corporation</em>.
That said, it is noted that there is no immutable rule that a document
which records a commercial transaction can never be an “affair of
State”. Further, the degree of relevancy and its importance to a
fair disposal of the dispute between the parties is also a factor
to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In
the present case, the Plaintiff submits that even though the AR
was showed a letter stating that the STB had objected to the disclosure,
the AR went on to hold (at [23]) that “there is no evidence before
this court that the documents or correspondences were obtained or
given in official confidence, nor is there any evidence from any
government official that public interests would suffer by the disclosure
of documents or correspondence”.  After reviewing the helpful submissions
of both parties, I have come to the view that the Defendant has
not established a basis for the claim to protection on the ground
of “affairs of State”. In any case, I would also add (in passing)
that not only does the DA appear to be a document which records
a commercial transaction between the STB and the Defendant, the
general relevance of the document to the substantive issues at hand
is, at the very least, reasonably clear. In saying this, the court
is not in any way suggesting that the contents of the DA will necessarily
be decisive for either the Plaintiff or the Defendant. Nevertheless,
it does appear to be a document that will assist in the fair resolution
of the dispute between the parties. For the sake of clarity, neither
is this court making any holding in relation to the original request
for discovery of the correspondence evidencing the attempts made
by the Defendant to secure consent from the STB. Leaving aside the
issues relating to s 5 of the OSA and “affairs of State”, the relevance
of these correspondences to the substantive issues in the main dispute
appears rather doubtful at this stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I
turn now to touch briefly on the position of the URA.  In the original request
for specific discovery, the Plaintiff (at para 5 of the Schedule)
sought disclosure of the documents evidencing the URA’s request
for the premises to be surrendered. This category refers to correspondences,
as well as minutes of meetings on the surrender request. The response
of the Defendant was that save for the DA and the Request for Proposal,
there are no documents evidencing URA’s request for the premises
to be surrendered.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> That being so, the principal
dispute in relation to this part of the specific discovery request
was, for all practical purposes, confined to the DA signed by the
Defendant with the STB as well as the Request for Proposal that
pre-dated the DA and which provisions were incorporated by reference
into the DA. The dispute here is largely the same as that discussed above
in relation to the STB: s 5 of the OSA and s 125 of the Evidence
Act. The main difference is that the Request for Proposal does not
appear to have been made available online and publicly disclosed.
 That said, the Request for Proposal was itself referred to in the
2011 Annual Report. This court notes that, whilst the URA is listed
as a specified organisation in the OSA, there is no suggestion that
the DA including the Supplemental Agreement or the Request for Proposal
was made with the URA. Given the decision made in respect of the
claim by the Defendant to privilege in respect of the STB (whether
under the OSA or the Evidence Act), it follows that the claim also
fails here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The
Defendant’s appeal against the decision of the AR in SUM 2743/2013
is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     For
the sake of clarity and completeness, this court is reminded that on
9 September 2013, when the case was first argued on appeal, the
matter was adjourned for further submissions on the OSA and the
scope of “affairs of State”. At that hearing, the court was informed
that the appeal had been narrowed to Categories 1(i) and 5 of the
Schedule. That being so, this court ordered discovery for the rest
of the documents (in the other categories/paragraphs) in accordance
with the AR’s Order. The appeal, therefore, turned only on these
two categories of the Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Costs
are awarded to the Plaintiff and to be taxed.</p>
