<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The case before me concerns an application by a
                    bank to enforce a “pledge” of shares in a private company.
                    Initially, the application sought an order for the enforcement of the
                    “pledge” without further notice to the defendants and without
                    reference to the Articles of Association of the company. Typically, the Articles
                    of Association of private companies would provide for the exercise of
                    pre-emption rights in respect of the sale of shares to <em>other</em> members of the company. How would such a pre-emption right
                    operate when the private company is a wholly owned subsidiary? When questions as
                    regards the difficulties posed by the plaintiff’s application were raised
                    by the court, the original application was abandoned and in its place various
                    declaratory reliefs were sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In their attempt to resist the application,
                    various allegations of fraud were raised by the defendants against the bank.
                    Fraud is “<em>easy</em>” to allege and not
                    infrequently is raised in affidavits without any basis to support the
                    allegation. This judgment will also address counsel’s duty to act
                    responsibly when raising allegations of fraud. Counsel and the clients they
                    represent should be reminded that legal proceedings cannot be used as a
                        “<em>licence</em>” or a “<em>shield</em>” to cast serious allegations of fraud
                    without any credible basis.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Underlying transaction: Share Subscription Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 10 November 2006, Mr Ram and
                    Mr Padma of Teledata and/or Baytech, met with Ms Chay and Mr Goel of
                    eSys, wherein it was proposed that Teledata was interested in investing in eSys.
                    A Share Subscription Agreement (“SSA”) dated 29 November 2006 was
                    thereafter entered into between Mr Goel, eSys and Teledata.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The acquisition of majority control of eSys by
                    Teledata was implemented via the acquisition of shares in Rainforest, a special
                    purpose vehicle set up by eSys. Consequently, on 29 December 2006, eSys
                    passed directors’ resolutions to approve the transfer of its entire issued
                    and paid up share capital to Rainforest. eSys’s share capital consisted of
                    20 million fully paid up ordinary shares. In the result, eSys became a wholly
                    owned subsidiary of Rainforest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Terms of SSA and Supplemental Agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The salient terms of the SSA are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Rainforest, a special purpose
                        vehicle, was to be incorporated in the British Virgin Islands for the
                        purpose of the SSA. Mr Goel would conduct a share swap by transferring
                        all of his shares in eSys to Rainforest in return for 49% of the
                        shareholding of Rainforest.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Teledata would invest approximately US$65 million in
                        equity in Rainforest and would extend a further loan of US$40 million to
                        Rainforest.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Rainforest was to utilise the monies and extend loans of up to US$60
                        million to eSys.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     Teledata would hold 51% of the shares in Rainforest upon payment of
                        the requisite sums.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendants stated that the SSA dated
                    29 November 2006 was subsequently revised by supplemental agreements on
                    29 November 2006 (twice), 9 February 2007 (once) and 14 February 2007
                    (once). Under the amended SSA, the defendants stated that it was agreed by
                    Mr Goel and eSys that Baytech was to be appointed as Teledata’s
                    nominee for the purposes of subscribing to shares in Rainforest pursuant to the
                    SSA. SBI SG denied knowledge of any amendments having been made to the SSA dated
                    29 November 2006. However, in an email chain between Mr Ram and
                    Mr Uthayacharan, the advocate and solicitor representing SBI SG ,
                    Mr Uthayacharan specifically raised queries to Mr Ram in relation to
                    the supplemental agreement to the SSA dated 9 February 2007. From the email
                    chain, it would appear that contrary to SBI SG’s assertion, SBI SG was
                    aware of the supplemental agreements to the SSA. However, for reasons as
                    explained in <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> below, nothing turns on
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In or around December 2006, payments due and
                    owing under the SSA from Teledata to eSys had not been made. Mr Padma and
                    Mr Ram informed Ms Chay and Mr Goel that Teledata had applied for
                    a loan to finance the acquisition of the shares in Rainforest and that the
                    payments due and owing under the SSA would be made soon thereafter. It was at
                    this point that SBI SG entered into the picture, in the provision of a sizeable
                    loan facility to Baytech.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Facility Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Sometime in or around December 2006, Teledata
                    decided to obtain financing from SBI SG and negotiations were underway between
                    the parties as evidenced by the “indicative quote” dated
                    31 January 2007 from SBI SG to Teledata. However, as Baytech was the
                    special purpose vehicle of Teledata for the purposes of this loan facility, SBI
                    SG’s letter of offer dated 31 January 2007 was addressed to Baytech
                    instead. Upon conclusion of the negotiations, SBI SG entered into a Facility
                    Agreement dated 22 February 2007 (“the Facility Agreement”)
                    with Baytech. Pursuant to the terms of the Facility Agreement, SBI SG
                    agreed, <em>inter alia</em>, to make available a US Dollar
                    term loan facility in aggregate sum of US$80 million to Baytech. The
                    “Final Maturity Date” was defined as 36 months from the date of
                    drawdown and the entire loan facility was drawn down by Baytech in one tranche
                    on 23 February 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Pursuant to cl 3.1, the stated purpose of the
                    Facility Agreement was clearly to finance the acquisition of 51% of the shares
                    in Rainforest though the SSA was not specifically referred to in the Facility
                    Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Borrower [Baytech] shall apply all amounts borrowed by it under the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     A number of securities were provided to SBI SG
                    pursuant to cl 4 of the Facility Agreement to secure Baytech’s liability
                    in the event of default:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     Corporate Guarantee by

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_f"></a>(f)     Pledge of 51% of the paid up share capital of eSys to be acquired out of
                        the facility, which pledge shall be completed and duly registered as a
                        charge in favour of SBI SG within 30 days of the execution of the Facility

                    the loan provided by SBI SG to Baytech under the Facility Agreement.
                    Furthermore, on or around 10 December 2007, Rainforest had pursuant to the

                        drawdown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is common ground that in breach of cl 7.1, Baytech failed to
                    make payment of the US$13 million due and owing to SBI SG on 20 February
                    2009. By letter dated 25 March 2010 to Baytech, SBI SG declared that an
                    event of default had occurred under the Facility Agreement and that all
                    outstanding sums, together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued
                    under the Facility Agreement became immediately due and payable. SBI SG stated
                    that a sum of US$41,989,189.91 plus interest accrued from the date of default
                    until the date of full payment was due and owing under the Facility Agreement to
                    be paid within seven days of receipt of the letter, <em>ie</em>, on 2 April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Having received no response from Baytech, by
                    way of letters dated 16 April 2010, SBI SG called upon Teledata and
                    Mr Padma to pay under the corporate and personal guarantees respectively.
                    Teledata and Mr Padma failed to make the payment within the stipulated
                    deadline. In light of the failure of the guarantors to honour their respective
                    guarantees, SBI SG then sought to enforce its security over the Pledged Shares
                    towards repayment of the outstanding debt owed by Baytech. This was the
                    background against which the principal issue relating to the enforcement of the
                    Pledged Shares came before this court for determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multiplicity of legal proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The parties central to the present dispute
                    have also commenced other proceedings against each other in India, New York and
                    Singapore. In or around November 2009, Teledata commenced court proceedings
                    against Mr Goel and eSys in India. Mr Goel and eSys have also
                    commenced committal proceedings against Teledata in India on the basis that
                    Teledata had relied on a forged document in the Indian
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 18 November 2010, Mr Goel and
                    Rainforest brought an action in New York against Mr Ramachandran, Bunge Ltd
                    and Bunge SA in relation to the illegal transfer of US$7.5 million out of
                    Rainforest’s bank account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 12 November 2010, Mr Goel and
                    Rainforest commenced arbitration proceedings in Singapore against, <em>inter alia</em>, Teledata, in relation to, <em>inter alia</em>, the use of a purportedly forged SSA (“the
                    forged copy”) by Teledata. In the arbitration proceedings, the defendants
                    are seeking an order for Teledata/Baytech to procure the delivery up of the
                    Pledged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is, however, material to highlight that SBI
                    SG is <b><em>not</em></b> a party to any of the other proceedings
                    and, more significantly, none of the papers filed in support of the legal
                    proceedings contain any allegations against SBI SG. However, on 18 May 2011
                    (one day prior to the hearing of OS 958/2010) Rainforest commenced a separate
                    action, Suit No 362/2011 (“S 362/2011”) against SBI SG and others,
                    seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, an order to set aside the
                    Pledged Shares, essentially in reliance on the various allegations raised
                    against SBI SG in the present action, OS 958/2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural history of the OS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At the Pre-Trial conference held on 12 October
                    2010 in relation to OS 958/2010, in response to the defendants’
                    notice that they would be raising allegations of fraud, the Senior Assistant
                    Registrar, Mr Yeong Zee Kin directed the defendants to file an application
                    to convert OS 958/2010 to a writ action. Accordingly, the defendants filed
                    Summons No 5300 of 2010/B (“the Summons”) and it came before an
                    Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) on 11 January 2011 whereupon
                    he ordered OS 958/2010 to be converted to a writ action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     SBI SG appealed against the AR’s
                    decision and on 4 March 2011, Kan Ting Chiu J allowed the appeal and
                    restored the action as OS 958/2010. In Kan J’s view, the allegations
                    of fraud raised in the affidavits by the defendants did not constitute
                    sufficient evidence to warrant the conversion of OS 958/2010 to a writ action.
                    In any event, Kan J opined that the allegations of fraud could be
                    re-considered by the court at the substantive hearing in OS 958/2010. There was
                    no appeal from Kan J’s decision. For reasons which I will elaborate below
                    at <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>–<a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>, it is clear to me that the allegations of fraud raised by
                    the defendants are devoid of any merit and consequently have no bearing on the
                    substantive issues before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The original OS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     SBI SG presented a straightforward case in OS
                    958/2010. As an event of default had occurred under the Facility Agreement, SBI
                    SG sought to perfect its security in the Pledged Shares. SBI SG submitted that
                    the deposit of the share certificates accompanied by a signed blank share
                    transfer form gave rise to an equitable mortgage with an implied power of sale
                    upon default. The crux of the defendants’ case was that the Pledged Shares
                    were procured and/or obtained through an elaborate fraud perpetrated by
                    Teledata, Baytech and SBI SG. As a result of the purported fraud and forgery,
                    the defendants argued that Rainforest was induced into granting the Pledged
                    Shares as security for the Facility Agreement and consequently, by reason of SBI
                    SG’s involvement in the fraud, SBI SG is not entitled to benefit from or
                    enforce the Pledged Shares. Further, the defendants reinstated their original
                    position that OS 958/2010 should be converted to a writ action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As Baytech and Teledata are not parties to
                    these proceedings and the enforcement of SBI SG’s security in the Pledged
                    Shares is the primary issue before the court, the defendants’ case rested
                    on establishing that SBI SG was complicit in the purported fraud. It cannot be
                    gainsaid that the fraud, if any, perpetrated by other parties to this dispute,
                    in the absence of complicity on the part of SBI SG, would not affect the
                    validity or enforceability of the Pledged Shares.</p>

                    Chacko (“Mr Chacko”) initially challenged OS 958/2010 only on
                    the basis of various allegations of fraud/forgery and complicity against SBI SG.
                    In the course of the hearing, I expressed my doubts as to whether the court is
                    empowered to order the sale of the Pledged Shares without reference to the eSys
                    Articles. I invited both Mr Chacko and counsel for SBI SG, Mr Pradeep
                    Pillai (“Mr Pillai”) to research the point and on resumption
                    of the hearing, both counsel accepted that any sale of the Pledged Shares, even
                    if ordered by the court, must comply with the eSys Articles. Under these
                    circumstances, Mr Pillai, having considered the inherent difficulties with
                    the original reliefs, sought leave to amend OS 958/2010 (“Amended

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Arising from the Amended OS, the following
                    issues are before me for determination:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     Should this OS be converted to a
                        writ action?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     Has an event of default occurred under the Facility
                    Agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     Is there
                        any merit in the defendants’ allegations of SBI SG’s complicity
                        in the purported fraud of Teledata/Baytech?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a>(d)     Does the deposit of share certificates and a
                        signed blank share transfer form as security give rise to an equitable
                        mortgage?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_e"></a>(e)     Whether the deposit of share certificates together with a signed blank
                        share transfer form alone, gives an equitable mortgagee a power of
                        sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_f"></a>(f)     How do
                        restrictions in the eSys Articles affect the implied power of sale of an
                        equitable mortgagee?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_g"></a>(g)     Assuming there is such a power of sale, how does SBI SG as an
                        equitable mortgagee enforce the power of sale with reference to the eSys
                        Articles?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_h"></a>(h)     How
                        do the eSys Articles operate when the shares involved a wholly owned
                        subsidiary, <em>ie</em>, eSys, “pledged”
                        by its holding company, Rainforest?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_i"></a>(i)     Given that SBI SG accepts that the court cannot order the
                        sale of the Pledged Shares without reference to the eSys Articles, is there
                        any practical purpose in the court granting the relief sought by SBI
                        SG?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Issues (d) to (i) were raised by the court and both
                    parties were given time to address them by way of supplementary written
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Should the OS be converted to a writ action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In spite of the Order made by Kan J, the
                    defendants revived their earlier submission that OS 958/2010 should be converted
                    to a writ action to be heard together with S 362/2011 or in the alternative,
                    that OS 958/2010 should be heard after the conclusion of S 362/2011. In my view,
                    there is no merit in this submission. First, the defendants did not appeal
                    against Kan J’s decision when he disallowed the application to convert OS
                    958/2010 to a writ action. Secondly, although Kan J remarked that the fraud
                    allegations could be re-considered by the judge hearing the substantive
                    application, for reasons which will be apparent below (see <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>–<a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>), having considered the allegations, I can see no reason
                    why the matter cannot be disposed of by way of the Amended OS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Has an event of default occurred</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     By letter dated 25 March 2010 to Baytech, SBI
                    SG declared that an event of default had occurred under the Facility Agreement
                    and that all outstanding sums, together with accrued interest, and all other
                    amounts accrued under the Facility Agreement became immediately due and payable.
                    There was no response from Baytech.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In their written submissions, the defendants
                    conceded that they are not in a position to challenge SBI SG’s assertion
                    that Baytech is in default. However, Mr Chacko submitted that since Baytech
                    is not a party to OS 958/2010, such a declaration does not bind Baytech and
                    therefore there is “no legitimate reason in granting the
                    declaration” and to do so, the court would be acting in
                vain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     While it is correct that Baytech is not a
                    party to OS 958/2010, I disagree with Mr Chacko that there is no legitimate
                    reason to declare that an event of default has occurred. For reasons as
                    explained in <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>–<a href="#p1_96">[96]</a> below, the implied power of sale of an
                    equitable mortgagee only arises by operation of law upon default. That being the
                    case, a declaration of default must necessarily precede any steps to enforce the
                    Pledged Shares. On the evidence before me, there can be no doubt that an event
                    of default has occurred under the Facility Agreement and I so declare
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The fraud allegations raised by the defendants </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendants’ principal argument,
                    whether under the original OS or the Amended OS, was that SBI SG’s
                    security interest in the “Pledged Shares” was tainted by fraud,
                    forgery and bribery (“collectively referred to as the fraud
                    allegations”). In an effort to make good their case on fraud, the
                    defendants have raised a wide range of fraud allegations against SBI SG, each of
                    which will be examined below. However, before embarking on a detailed review of
                    the fraud allegations, it is perhaps useful to take cognisance of the rules
                    governing reliance on hearsay evidence in affidavits and the duty of counsel in
                    raising allegations of fraud in affidavits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contents of the defendants’ affidavits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Order 41 rule 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap
                    322, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”) pertaining to the
                    contents of affidavits states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Subject to the other provisions of these Rules, an affidavit may
                        contain only <em>such facts as the deponent is able of his
                            own knowledge to prove</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) An affidavit sworn for the purpose of being used in interlocutory
                        proceedings may contain statements of information or belief with the sources
                        and grounds thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The default rule is that an affidavit may only
                    contain facts within the deponent’s personal knowledge. The exception to
                    this default rule is set out under O 41 r 5(2) which permits reference to
                    hearsay evidence for interlocutory proceedings provided the grounds and source
                    of belief are stated. While the Rules of Court do not specifically define the
                    term “interlocutory proceedings” for the purposes of O 41 r 5(2),
                    there is a considerable body of case law on point. In <em>MUI
                        Bank Bhd v Alkner Investments Pte Ltd</em> [1990] 3 MLJ 385 at
                    387–388, following the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Rossage v Rossage</em> [1960] 1 WLR 249, Chao Hick Tin JC (as
                    he then was) held that the application before him was not an interlocutory
                    matter as it was an application “to determine the rights of the
                    parties”. Adopting a similar approach to Chao JC, in
                        “<em>The Ocean Jade”</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 354 at <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a>,
                    Karthigesu J stated that “only those applications which do not
                    decide the rights of the parties can be considered to be interlocutory”.
                    The relevant distinction is essentially between proceedings which seek an order
                    relating to the conduct or progress of the action or for the purposes of keeping
                    things in <em>status quo</em> till the rights can be
                    decided and proceedings which require the court to adjudicate on the
                    parties’ substantive rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Pillai submitted that the OS before me
                    clearly falls in the latter category. This was not challenged by Mr Chacko.
                    The court is faced with the task of determining whether an event of default has
                    occurred, whether an equitable mortgage has arisen, if so whether a power of
                    sale has accrued and whether an order should be made to facilitate the fair
                    valuation of the Pledged Shares so as to enforce the eventual sale and transfer
                    of the Pledged Shares. The declaratory reliefs sought by SBI SG are not
                    interlocutory in nature as they cover substantive rights. It is clear that the
                    underlying purpose of O 41 r 5(1) is to ensure that ordinary rules of evidence
                    including the prohibition of hearsay evidence apply when the substantive rights
                    of parties are being adjudicated. Accordingly, the exception of O 41 r 5(2) does
                    not extend to the defendants in which event the defendants are precluded from
                    making allegations in its affidavits outside the personal knowledge of the
                    deponents. This might well be the reason why the defendants sought to convert
                    the OS to a writ action in order to circumvent the prohibition under O 41 r
                    5(1). This will become even clearer when the specific allegations of fraud are
                    scrutinised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It should also be pointed out that there are
                    professional rules of conduct governing the conduct of solicitors in the
                    drafting of affidavits containing allegations of fraud. In this regard, lawyers
                    should be reminded that Rule 59 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)
                    Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2010 Rev Ed) dictates as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Facts, arguments and
                            allegations</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An advocate or solicitor shall not contrive facts which will assist his
                        client’s case <b>or</b> draft any originating
                        process, pleading, <b>affidavit</b>, witness
                        statement or notice or grounds of appeal containing:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) any allegation of fraud unless he has clear instructions to make such
                        allegation <b>and</b><em>has before him reasonable credible material which as it
                            stands establishes a prima facie case of fraud</em>; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) <em>in the case of an affidavit or witness statement,
                            any statement of fact other than the evidence which in substance
                            according to his instructions the advocate and solicitor reasonably
                            believes the witness would give if the evidence contained in the
                            affidavit or witness statement were being given
                        orally</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Rule 59 stipulates that an affidavit should
                    not contain allegations of fraud unless the advocate or solicitor has before him
                    reasonable credible material to establish a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of fraud. In my view, the graver the allegation of
                    fraud, <em>eg</em>, bribery, the greater the need for
                    counsel to address the issue of reasonable credible evidence to support it. In
                    the present case, as will be appreciated below, a number of the fraud
                    allegations made by the defendants were based entirely on hearsay evidence. The
                    question is whether evidence, inadmissible by reason of its hearsay nature, is
                        <em>ipso facto</em> not reasonably credible for the
                    purposes of r 59. As no submission was made by either counsel on this issue and
                    since its determination is strictly not necessary for the purposes of the
                    Amended OS, I shall refrain from expressing a view on the matter. However, I
                    wish to take this opportunity to remind counsel of their duty under r
                59.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The fraud allegations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The defendants have made wide ranging
                    allegations in relation to the purportedly fraudulent conduct of Teledata,
                    Baytech, SBI SG and a number of other unrelated entities to this action.
                    Specifically, the defendants made the following allegations, each of which will
                    be considered below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     The SSA exhibited by SBI SG was the
                        forged copy and by comparing it with the “true copy”, SBI SG
                        would have been or was put on notice of the purported forgery (“the
                        Forgery Allegation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     SBI SG did not monitor the use of the loan monies by
                        Baytech in accordance with the stated purpose of the Facility Agreement
                        (“the Failure to Monitor Allegation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     SBI SG was complicit in the fraud of
                        Teledata and Baytech, in relation to the procurement of the Pledged Shares
                        (“the Fraudulent Procurement Allegation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>(d)     SBI SG was complicit in the fraudulent
                        conduct of Teledata and Baytech such as the churning of debts and acceptance
                        of bribes from the representatives of Teledata in granting the Facility
                        Agreement. OS 958/2010 was also filed by SBI SG to gain majority
                        control of eSys in order to stymie other proceedings from being commenced by
                        the defendants (“the Bribery
                Allegation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Forgery Allegation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The defendants alleged that Teledata relied on
                    the “forged copy” of the SSA to obtain the Facility Agreement from
                    SBI SG. The defendants asserted that the SSA drafted by M/s Drew &amp; Napier
                    LLC and certified by Mr Aaron Kok Ther Chien of Drew &amp; Napier LLC, was
                    the “true copy” of the SSA which accurately reflects the agreement
                    reached between eSys, Mr Goel and Teledata. By reason of a range of
                    “glaring inconsistencies” identified between the “true
                    copy” and the “forged copy” of the SSA, the defendants
                    claimed that the SSA exhibited by SBI SG was a forgery and that SBI SG should
                    have been put on notice of the forgery. The following discrepancies were
                    identified between the “forged copy” and the “true
                    copy” of the SSA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 2.1 of the “forged
                        copy” of the SSA stated that the acquisition price for each
                        Rainforest share was $1.00. Hence for the 61,200,201 Rainforest shares to be
                        purchased, the total sum payable by Teledata should have been US$61,200,201.
                        Instead, cll 2.1 and 2.3 reflected the total sum payable as US$105
                        million.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        “forged copy” of the SSA was signed only on the execution page
                        whereas the “true copy” was signed and initialled on every
                        page.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        “forged copy” of the SSA contained numerous spelling,
                        formatting errors and was poorly drafted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_d"></a>(d)     No reference was made to Baytech in the
                        “forged copy” of the SSA raising questions as to why SBI SG
                        would extend the Facility Agreement to Baytech.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The defendants averred that Teledata and/or
                    Baytech forged the SSA exhibited by SBI SG dated 29 November 2006 to reflect a
                    higher sum payable for the Rainforest shares (<em>ie</em>,
                    US$105 million instead of about US$61 million) so as to procure a larger loan
                    from SBI SG. The crux of the defendants’ argument was that SBI SG knew or
                    ought to have known that the SSA was a forgery but nonetheless approved and
                    extended the Facility Agreement to Baytech to purchase shares from Rainforest at
                    an inflated price. The defendants argued that by reference to the “true
                    copy” of the SSA and its supplemental agreements, it was apparent or
                    ought to have been apparent to SBI SG that “the documentation underlying
                    the transaction was flawed”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The defendants averred that under cl 2.3 of
                    the “forged copy” of the SSA, Teledata (or its
                    subsidiaries/associates) would make payment of US$105 million to acquire a 51%
                    interest in Rainforest. The defendants stated that in the “true
                    copy” of the SSA, the acquisition price was instead stated as US$61
                    million. The defendants therefore extrapolated that by advancing a loan facility
                    of US$80 million in reliance on the “forged copy”, SBI SG
                    effectively granted Baytech a loan of 76% of the total price payable to acquire
                    the 51% interest in Rainforest. As 76% of the total consideration price of
                    US$105 million was granted pursuant to the Facility Agreement, the defendants
                    speculated that if the “true copy” had been relied on, SBI SG
                    might only have approved a loan of US$46 million (<em>ie</em>, 76% of US$61 million). On the back of this submission, the
                    defendants then rationalised that SBI SG cannot legitimately claim for the
                    outstanding amount of US$41,989,189.91 due and owing under the Facility
                    Agreement because this would mean that more than US$38 million
                    (US$80 million – US$41,989,189.91) has since been repaid under the
                    Facility Agreement. It therefore follows, according to the defendants, that if
                    the loan amount had been US$46 million instead of US$80 million, the balance
                    outstanding would only have been about US$8.5 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The heart of the “Forgery
                    Allegation” presupposed two fundamental assumptions. First, SBI SG had in
                    its possession both the “forged copy” and the “true
                    copy” of the SSA and second that if Rainforest had known that the loan
                    amount to Baytech under the Facility Agreement was US$80 million, Rainforest
                    would not have pledged the eSys shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It should be noted that the defendants have
                    not alleged that SBI SG had in any way participated in the
                    “forgery” of the SSA. They merely asserted that by comparing both
                    versions of the SSA, SBI SG ought to have known that the version in its
                    possession was forged. However, the defendants have not adduced any evidence to
                    establish that SBI SG had received the “true copy” of the SSA at
                    any material time. Upon my examination of both versions of the SSA, I found it
                    interesting that at the top of every page of the “forged copy”,
                    the facsimile printout clearly evidenced that the “forged copy”
                    was faxed over by Teledata to SBI SG on 15 February 2007. In contrast, no
                    similar marking appeared on the “true copy”. In the absence of any
                    evidence that SBI had received the “true copy”, the defendants
                    could not credibly assert that SBI SG was in possession of both versions and was
                    thereby put on notice of the discrepancies by comparing them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Although it appears that SBI SG was aware of
                    the supplemental agreements to the SSA, the defendants have not suggested that
                    SBI SG knew or ought to have known that the SSA in its possession was the
                    “forged copy” from a perusal of the supplemental agreements. It is
                    also curious for the defendants to claim that since no reference was made to
                    Baytech in the “forged copy” of the SSA, it raises questions as to
                    why SBI SG would extend the Facility Agreement to Baytech. By the same token, no
                    reference was made to Baytech in the “true copy” of the SSA as
                    well. Further, when I perused the supplemental agreements (which the defendants
                    claimed SBI SG were aware of), there was actually a reference to Baytech in the
                    supplemental agreement dated 9 February 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Further, while it cannot be denied that the
                    loan under the Facility Agreement was to finance the purchase of 51%
                    shareholding in Rainforest, the execution of the SSA, true or forged copy, under
                    which the Rainforest shares were purchased was not a condition precedent to the
                    Facility Agreement and was in fact not even referred to in the Facility
                    Agreement. It is relevant to point out that SBI SG only received the
                    “forged copy” on 15 February 2007, <em>after</em> the letter of offer for the Facility Agreement had been
                    issued to Baytech on 31 January 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     While it is true that the Facility Agreement
                    was executed on 22 February 2007 <em>after</em>
                    receipt of the “forged copy” of the SSA, it is crucial to note
                    from the three letters dated 5 April 2007 signed by Mr Goel on behalf of
                    Rainforest and eSys as well as the charge over the Pledged Shares registered by
                    Rainforest (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>–<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above), that Rainforest knew that the loan
                    amount under the Facility Agreement was US$80 million. Therefore the forgery,
                    even if true, does not alter the undeniable fact that Rainforest knew that the
                    Pledged Shares were offered as security for a US$80 million loan to Baytech
                    under the Facility Agreement. It is disingenuous for the defendants to undertake
                    a speculative mathematical exercise as to what the loan amount would have been
                    had SBI SG been aware of the “true copy” of the SSA when by the
                    objective evidence before me, Rainforest knew fully well that the Pledged Shares
                    were offered as security for a US$80 million loan to Baytech. If what the
                    defendants say is true, it would mean that Rainforest, eSys and Mr Goel who
                    signed the three letters were themselves complicit in obtaining a loan at an
                    inflated price of the Rainforest shares under the “true copy” of
                    the SSA. As such, it is fallacious for the defendants to submit that
                    “[i]f the Defendants had known of the attempts to rely on a forged
                    document for the purposes of fraudulently obtaining a higher loan facility, the
                    Defendants would not have agreed to grant any charges to SBI over the
                    shares.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     On the facts before this court, no evidence
                    was adduced to establish that SBI SG had any knowledge of the purported forgery
                    or had even received the allegedly “true copy” of the SSA in order
                    to be placed on notice of the alleged discrepancies. Finally, as highlighted
                    above, Rainforest at all material times was fully aware that the loan under the
                    Facility Agreement was US$80 million and more importantly, willingly offered the
                    Pledged Shares as security for the Facility Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Failure to Monitor Allegation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The defendants stated that the Facility
                    Agreement was not used for its stated purpose as Baytech did not utilise the
                    loan monies to make the payments due and owing to Rainforest in accordance with
                    the SSA. While the Facility Agreement or the letter of offer did not make
                    specific reference to the SSA, by reason of cl 3.1 of the Facility Agreement,
                    reproduced at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>, it is apparent that the
                    purpose of the US$80 million loan was to acquire the 51% shareholding in
                    Rainforest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Did Teledata and/or Baytech fail to make
                    payment to Rainforest in breach of the SSA? If so, how is this relevant to the
                    issues to the present dispute? In an affidavit filed by Mr Goel in a
                    separate proceeding in Suit 854 of 2006 (“S 854/2006”) at
                        [63], he confirmed that Teledata had
                    paid US$55 million for 55 million shares in Rainforest. Of the US$55
                    million paid to Rainforest, US$31 million was paid after the Facility
                    Agreement was executed on or about 22 February 2007. So clearly at least a
                    substantial part of the loan was used to pay for the Rainforest shares. The
                    defendants argued that in breach of cl 3.1 of the Facility Agreement, the
                    balance US$49 million of the loan disbursed by SBI SG was not used to fund the
                    acquisition of the 51% shareholding of Rainforest. Further, the defendants
                    claimed that the subscription price of US$61 million has not been paid in full
                    and until full payment, Baytech was not entitled to the shares in Rainforest and
                    as such the defendants argued that it was “inconceivable that SBI [SG]
                    could claim rights to these shares under a purported charge”.
                    Baytech’s purported breaches of its obligations to Rainforest under the
                    SSA are currently the subject matter of separate arbitration proceedings in
                    Singapore between, <em>inter alia</em>, Mr Goel,
                    Rainforest, Teledata and Baytech to which SBI SG is not a party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     There are serious and insurmountable
                    difficulties in the defendants’ arguments. First, under cl 3.2 of the
                    Facility Agreement, SBI SG was not required to monitor the use of the loan
                    facility by Baytech/Teledata:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No Finance Party is bound to monitor or verify the application of any
                        amount borrowed pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">“Finance Party” is defined in the Facility Agreement to
                    include the Lender, SBI SG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Secondly, it is clear that the loan amount of
                    US$80 million was in fact granted to Baytech and that there was a drawdown by
                    Baytech of the entire US$80 million in one tranche on 23 January 2007. The
                    enforcement of any security, including the Pledged Shares, under the Facility
                    Agreement was in no way contingent on the successful completion of the SSA
                    particularly since the SSA was concluded some three months <em>prior</em> to the Facility Agreement. Contrary to the
                    defendants’ submission, there is nothing “inconceivable” for
                    SBI SG to enforce the Pledged Shares upon default of the Facility Agreement. Any
                    non-payment by Teledata and/or Baytech under the SSA is irrelevant to the rights
                    and obligations of SBI SG <em>vis-a-vis</em> Rainforest in
                    relation to the Pledged Shares. They are entirely separate
                transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In any event, taking the defendants’
                    argument at its highest, even if Baytech had breached cl 2.3 of the SSA in
                    failing to make full payment for the Rainforest shares by the contractually
                    stipulated deadline of 30 December 2006, Rainforest nevertheless readily pledged
                    the shares to SBI SG on or about 5 April 2007, well after passing the payment
                    deadline. In other words, the shares were pledged notwithstanding the fact that
                    Rainforest had full knowledge that the purchase price under the SSA had not been
                    fully paid up. In spite of the alleged non-compliance with the stated purpose of
                    the Facility Agreement, Rainforest willingly and unequivocally provided security
                    by way of the Pledged Shares for the Facility Agreement and soon thereafter duly
                    registered a charge over the Pledged Shares in SBI SG’s favour in the
                    British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In an attempt to clarify Mr Goel’s
                    evidence in S 854/2006, the defendants stated that between December 2006 and
                    February 2007, a sum of US$55 million was indeed paid to Rainforest under the
                    SSA in ten separate deposits. However, they alleged that a total sum of
                    US$54,800,000 was then transferred out of Rainforest’s account as
                    short-term loans for Teledata’s suppliers for which Teledata agreed to pay
                    interest at 12% per annum. The defendants claimed that Rainforest’s bank
                    account was operated on the instructions of Baytech/Teledata and since Teledata
                    was a majority shareholder of Rainforest, there was no reason to doubt its
                    intentions. It is far from clear how this allegation or submission in any way
                    implicates SBI SG or relates to the central question of the validity or
                    enforceability of the Pledged Shares. The claim by Rainforest against Teledata
                    for repayment of theses alleged short term loans has nothing to do with the
                    enforceability of the Pledged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As SBI SG had no obligation to monitor the use
                    of the loan monies and as Rainforest had willingly provided security by way of
                    the Pledged Shares to SBI SG for the Facility Agreement notwithstanding
                    Baytech’s alleged failure to make payment of the full purchase price for
                    the Rainforest shares under the SSA, the defendants’ arguments at this
                    stage came across as an afterthought and were irrelevant to either the validity
                    or the enforceability of the Pledged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Fraudulent Procurement Allegation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The defendants submitted that the purpose of
                    the pledge was “intended to prevent a sale of the eSys Shares to third
                    parties” and not as security for the Facility Agreement. The defendants
                    submitted that sometime in or around January or February 2007, Ms Chay,
                    accompanied by another employee of eSys, handed over the Share Certificates to
                    Mr Uthayacharan, the solicitor representing SBI SG. The defendants reasoned
                    that the Share Certificates were delivered to Mr Utayacharan prior to the
                    execution of the Facility Agreement (<em>ie</em>, 22
                    February 2007) because Mr Goel and the defendants were allegedly informed
                    by Mr Ram of Teledata that SBI SG’s Mr S Adikesavan, the Manager
                    of Credit Administration, had made clear that the request for the pledge of eSys
                    shares was merely an administrative formality and would not amount to a formal
                    charge. SBI SG objected to this allegation as it is plainly hearsay. In
                    response, the defendants, while not denying its characterisation as hearsay
                    evidence, alleged that they were prevented by Teledata and its representatives
                    from having any contact with SBI SG and its officers. The primary contact
                    between them in respect of the Facility Agreement was Mr Ram from Teledata,
                    who purportedly repeatedly told them not to contact SBI SG or its officers. I
                    fail to see how the alleged difficulties experienced by the defendants in having
                    direct contact with SBI SG can render the evidence any more admissible. Even if
                    these representations had indeed been made by Teledata’s representatives
                    to the defendants, there is no objective evidence before me that SBI SG was
                    aware of them at any material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Notwithstanding these allegations, it is
                    undeniable that the express wording of the three covering letters from eSys and
                    Rainforest unequivocally referred to the Pledged Shares <em>as
                        security</em>. None of the letters referred to the alleged
                    “administrative formality”. Further, in an internal email dated 23
                    March 2007 from Mr Ravindran Varadarajan (“Mr Ravi”),
                    Senior Finance Manager of eSys to Ms Chay and Mr Ram, Mr Ravi informed
                    Ms Chay of the need to submit additional documents, namely a blank signed share
                    transfer form and a letter from Rainforest specifically stating that the Pledged
                    Shares were provided as <em>security</em> for the Facility
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the circumstances, I accept SBI SG’s
                    submission, that it was incredible that Mr Goel would have unreservedly
                    pledged 51% of the shares in eSys, issued a signed blank share transfer form and
                    consistently referred to the Pledged Shares as “security” if he
                    was indeed under the genuine belief that the pledge was merely an administrative
                    formality. Additionally, both Rainforest and eSys recorded SBI SG’s
                    interest in the Pledged Shares in their books and registers of members in
                    addition to registering a charge in the British Virgin Islands in favour of
                    SBI SG over the Pledged Shares. If the true purpose of the delivery of the
                    share certificates was <em>merely</em> to prevent a sale of
                    the same, eSys/Rainforest would not have undertaken such elaborate steps without
                    protest or query. Such a claim rings hollow in the face of clear objective
                    evidence that the shares were indeed “pledged” to SBI SG as
                    security for the Facility Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Bribery Allegation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     A multitude of serious allegations were made
                    by the defendants through the affidavits of Mr Goel and Mr Sharma
                    under this category. Each of them will be separately examined below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     In or around early 2007, at a
                        meeting held at a seafood restaurant in Bangkok, Mr Padma told
                        Mr Goel that Teledata paid a bribe of 2% of the Facility to senior
                        officers of SBI SG to ensure that the Facility was approved.<sup></sup></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     This is plainly hearsay and yet the serious
                    allegation of bribery was made without any qualms on the part of the defendants.
                    It is obvious that the allegedly “corrupt” senior officers of SBI
                    SG were not even identified. Further, Mr Goel, by his own evidence, knew
                    about the bribery in early 2007 and yet he continued to participate in the
                    transaction with Teledata and Mr Padma without any record of his protest in
                    the contemporaneous documents and thereafter took several steps in offering the
                    Pledged Shares as security for the Facility Agrement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_68-p2_b"></a>(b)     As SBI SG is a major international
                        bank, the bribe was “the only possible explanation for the failure of
                        [SBI SG’s] officers to perform proper due diligence to ensure that the
                        terms of the Facility Agreement are genuine and correctly reflect the
                        underlying documentation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Facility Agreement was supported by
                    contemporaneous documentation and there was no evidence that SBI SG had failed
                    to properly conduct proper due diligence. It is also clear from the evidence
                    that Rainforest was fully aware that the Pledged Shares were offered as security
                    for the US$80 million under the Facility Agreement. I fail to see how the
                    lack of due diligence on the part of SBI SG, if any, would necessarily mean that
                    the officers of SBI SG must therefore have been bribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"></a>(c)     SBI SG’s decision to release
                        the US$80 million to Baytech rather than Rainforest was “against
                        industry practice” as it facilitated fraud in cases where the buyer
                        did not use the said funds for the stated purpose. The defendants suggested
                        that normal practice would dictate releasing the funds directly to the
                        seller.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     This is an ill-considered allegation. It bears
                    mention that the Borrower under the Facility Agreement is Baytech and not
                    Rainforest. There is no reason why releasing the loan to Baytech, <em>ie</em>, the Borrower, would facilitate fraud or is contrary
                    to industry practice. The defendants’ scenario of dispensing the funds to
                    the seller is typically adopted where the agreement specifically provides for
                    release of the purchase price to the seller. Such a submission, in the absence
                    of any contractual obligation under the Facility Agreement, is bereft of any
                    merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_d"></a>(d)     Teledata and SBI SG shared a long
                        standing banking relationship and it is stated that in or around 2008,
                        Mr Padma and Mr Anush Ramachandran
                        (“Mr Ramachandran”) told Mr Goel that Teledata owed
                        substantial sums of money to SBI SG. Mr Padma and Mr Ramachandran
                        confirmed that SBI SG’s officers assisted Teledata in
                        “churning” its debts and other obligations, <em>ie</em>, establishing new dummy loans to settle existing
                        obligations owed to SBI SG. One of the examples stated of “churning
                        of debts” was Teledata making two separate payments amounting to
                        US$7.5 million to a Swiss Company Bunge SA, a company which had loans
                        with SBI SG. The defendants alleged that a substantial part of the balance
                        amount of approximately US$46 million of the remaining portion of the loan
                        facility also found its way back through Bunge/Teledata and other dummy
                        companies back to SBI SG.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     First, there is nothing objectionable or
                    unusual for banks to have long standing relationship with clients. In fact,
                    banks strive to achieve such relationships. Secondly, the above allegations are
                    completely hearsay. Although there was no basis for the defendants to have
                    alleged that part of the US$80 million loan found its way back to Teledata
                    and its related companies, nonetheless, during the hearing, I directed
                    Mr Pillai to produce documentary evidence to show that the loan monies had
                    in fact been disbursed to Baytech. In response to my direction, SBI SG filed an
                    affidavit by Marur Narasimha Aravind Kumar dated 19 May 2011 wherein a Swift
                    secure authenticated message was exhibited evidencing the transfer of US$80
                    million to Baytech’s account with HSBC Bank in Hong Kong. The loan was
                    therefore paid to a different bank (HSBC Bank) in a different country (Hong
                    Kong). Thirdly, by their own case, at least US$24 million had already been paid
                    by Teledata to Rainforest under the SSA <em>prior</em> to
                    the Facility Agreement. It therefore stands to logic that part of the loan
                    amount would not be released to Rainforest under the SSA otherwise there would
                    be overpayment. Finally, even if the allegation of debt churning is true, it
                    does not change the fact that the Pledged Shares were willingly offered by
                    Rainforest as security for the US$80 million loan under the Facility Agreement
                    and more pertinently, Rainforest had received at least US$31 million from the
                    loan drawdown.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_e"></a>(e)     If SBI SG was innocent it should
                        have made civil or criminal complaints against Baytech and Teledata by
                        reason of awareness of their forgery and fraud for almost 2 years now. HSBC,
                        Vijaya Bank and Canara Bank have all commenced proceedings against Teledata
                        in the past year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     This allegation presumes that Baytech and
                    Teledata are guilty of fraud or forgery but this has not been established. While
                    the defendants may be entirely comfortable to raise allegations of fraud without
                    foundation, the fact that others are not prepared to do so does not mean that
                    they are therefore complicit. This submission is nothing more than another
                    shocking specimen of a quantum leap in logic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     SBI SG has issued letters of demand to
                    Baytech, Teledata and Mr Padma and proceedings against the same, according
                    to Mr Pillai, are being contemplated in India. In any event, there is no
                    requirement at law that steps must be taken or judgment must be obtained against
                    the Borrower or the guarantors before SBI SG is entitled to enforce its security
                    over the Pledged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_f"></a>(f)     SBI SG refused to meet
                        Mr Sharma after the meeting in January/February 2010 to discuss the
                        fraud that Teledata had committed. SBI SG’s refusal to meet was
                        because it was involved in the said fraud and has been actively taking
                        instructions from Teledata executives and assisting Teledata for some years
                        to “churn” its old debts with new debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     This is another outrageous allegation which is
                    utterly baseless and speculative.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_g"></a>(g)     The defendants raised the fact that
                        beyond issuing the letters of demand to Baytech, Teledata and Mr Padma,
                        SBI SG has not done anything to enforce the various other securities
                        provided for under the Facility Agreement. Instead SBI SG has only taken
                        steps to enforce the Pledged Shares which the defendants speculated was to
                        gain control of eSys.<sup></sup>The defendants averred that SBI SG was working with
                        “Teledata to attempt to obtain control over [eSys] to stymie
                        [eSys’s] legal claims against [SBI SG] and Teledata and/or its
                        officers”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     This allegation should be examined in light of
                    the chronology of the various legal proceedings. It is not disputed that the
                    arbitration proceedings were commenced on 12 November 2010 some two months
                        <em>after</em> OS 958/2010 was filed (16 September
                    2010). Further, the motive behind the enforcement cannot affect the enforcement
                    rights of SBI SG against the Pledged Shares. Any suggestion that OS 958/2010 was
                    brought to stymie legal proceedings against SBI SG and/or Teledata is both
                    irrelevant and speculative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Mr Goel’s affidavit also raised
                    multiple unrelated allegations in relation to a number of unrelated entities to
                    these proceedings such as eSys Information Technologies Ltd (India), Bank of
                    India, AlphaSoft and Solitus. In my view, none of them have any bearing on the
                    validity or enforceability of the Pledged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Having determined that none of the fraud
                    allegations levelled by the defendants holds any water against SBI SG, I shall
                    now turn my attention to consider the issues of law raised by me during the
                    hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The nature of an equitable mortgage of shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is perhaps helpful to begin the analysis by
                    underscoring the fact that the deposit of share certificates together with a
                    blank share transfer form, often loosely described as a pledge of shares,
                    actually gives rise to an equitable mortgage and not a pledge. Associate
                    Profesor Poh Chu Chai in <em>Law of Pledges, Guarantees and
                        Letters of Credit</em> (Butterworths Asia, 5th Ed, 2003) at p 47
                    explains that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is fundamental to the concept of a pledge that possession of the
                        chattel being offered as security has to be transferred to the pledgee
                        either physically or constructively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A chose in action ... with the exception of negotiable securities, does
                        not constitute a convenient subject matter for a pledge. Generally, a chose
                        in action represents a personal right enforceable only with the assistance
                        of the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[L]egal title to the shares in a company passes to a third party only
                        after the share transfers are duly registered by the company. Thus, if a
                        chose in action is offered to a creditor as security, it is more appropriate
                        to talk of a mortgage of the chose in action rather than a pledge of the
                        chose in action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     There is ample authority, both local and
                    English cases, in support of the settled principle of law that the deposit of
                    share certificates together with a signed blank share transfer form creates an
                    equitable mortgage over the shares. Mr Pillai relied on <em>Harrold v Plenty</em> [1901] 2 Ch 314 (“<em>Harrold v Plenty</em>”) where the court held (at 316)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only material allegation in the statement of claim is that in March,
                        1897, the defendant deposited with Harrold the certificate of ten ordinary
                        shares in a limited company as security for the repayment to Harrold of the
                        sum of 150l., then owing to him from the defendant, with interest thereon at
                        the rate of 6<em>l</em>. per cent. per annum. <em>Now, it is plain that a pledgee is in a very different position
                            from an ordinary mortgagee. He has only a special property in the thing
                            pledged. He may obtain a sale, but he cannot obtain a foreclosure. I do
                            not think that this is properly a case of pledge</em>. A share is
                        a chose in action. The certificate is merely evidence of title, and whatever
                        may be the result of the deposit of a bearer bond, such as that which Sir
                        George Jessel dealt with in <em>Carter v. Wake</em>
                        (1), I think I cannot treat the plaintiff as a mere pledgee. <em>The deposit of the certificate by way of security for the debt,
                            which is admitted, seems to me to amount to an equitable mortgage, or,
                            in other words, to an agreement to execute a transfer of the shares by
                            way of mortgage</em>. The result is that the plaintiff is entitled
                        to a judgment substantially in the form which would be given if, instead of
                        the certificate of shares, the document had been a title-deed of real estate
                        or a policy of assurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In <em>Stubbs v
                        Slate</em>r [1910] 1 Ch 632 (“<em>Stubbs v
                        Slater</em>”), the court (at 638–639) arrived at the same
                    conclusion on the law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If one asks how they were entitled to sell it is necessary to go back a
                        step. The plaintiff handed over to the brokers one certificate for the 390
                        shares together with a transfer executed by the plaintiff in blank, in which
                        the numbers of the shares were specified, but the name of the purchaser and
                        the consideration were, of course, not specified. It was the ordinary
                        well-known transfer in blank. Now what is the effect of that? I am
                        astonished that there should be any doubt about it. So long ago as 1899
                        Stirling J. in <em>London and Midland Bank v
                            Mitchell</em> (1) dealt with a case of precisely this nature and
                        indicated what was the legal effect of it. <em>That was a
                            case in which certain shares together with a blank transfer had been
                            deposited with a bank to secure a debt</em>, and it was held that
                        the bank had not lost their right against the shares although their simple
                        contract remedy against the client was lost by reason of the Statute of
                        Limitations. <em>The Court there pointed out that the whole
                            transaction was a mortgage as to which the bank were entitled to the
                            ordinary remedy of foreclosure</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <em>Pacrim Investments Pte Lte v Tan Mui Keow Claire and
                        another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 898 at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> remarked:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for Pacrim conceded that the deposit of the share certificates
                        together with the signed blank transfers for the 70 million Consideration
                        Shares created an equitable mortgage. <em>We agree that, in
                            law, a “pledge” of share certificates accompanied by duly
                            signed transfers is an equitable mortgage</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I had occasion in the recent decision of
                        <em>Kong Swee Eng v Rolles Rudolf Jurgen August</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 873 (“<em>Kong Swee Eng</em>”)
                    to consider this area of the law. I observed that the decisions of <em>Harrold v Plenty</em> and <em>Stubbs v
                        Slater</em>, though not of recent vintage, remain good law. In
                        <em>Kong Swee Eng</em>, the facts were not as
                    straightforward as the present case. As part of the security for a sale and
                    purchase agreement, the majority shareholder granted a fixed charge over his
                    shares as security. Under the charge, the majority shareholder was supposed to
                    deposit the share certificates together with the duly executed share transfer
                    forms with an escrow agent. However, due to an oversight, the share certificates
                    and the executed share transfer forms were not deposited. In that case, it was
                    common ground between the parties that the pledge of the shares constituted an
                    equitable mortgage even though neither the share certificates nor the blank
                    share transfer forms were in fact deposited. I held at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> that the omission on the part of the majority shareholder
                    did not alter the nature of the security interest in the shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Leading textbooks have also made the position
                    clear beyond doubt. Edward I Sykes and Sally Walker, <em>The Law
                        of Securities</em> (The Law Book Company Limited, 5th Ed, 1993), at p
                    782 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] deposit of a share certificate has always been held to constitute an
                        equitable mortgage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, <em>Fisher and Lightwood’s Law of
                        Mortgage</em> (Wayne Clark ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 13th Ed, 2010)
                    (“Fisher and Lightwood”) at [17.23] also states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A mortgage of shares is most commonly effected by deposit of the share
                        certificates with the mortgagee ... <em>This is not a mere
                            pledge, but affects a true equitable mortgage entitling the mortgagee to
                            foreclosure</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It was therefore not remarkable for
                    Mr Chacko to have initially conceded during the hearing that SBI SG’s
                    interest in the Pledged Shares was indeed in the nature of an equitable
                    mortgagee. However, he subsequently changed his position during the hearing and
                    claimed that the deposit of the Pledged Shares together with the duly executed
                    blank share transfer form “<em>without
                    more</em>” was in law, no more than a possessory lien over the
                    shares in order to prevent Rainforest from dealing with or selling the shares.
                    To borrow the words of Cozens-Hardy MR in <em>Stubbs v
                        Slater</em> at 639, “<em>I am astonished that
                        there should be any doubt about it</em>” [emphasis
                    added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In his written submissions, Mr Chacko
                    suggested that <em>Harrold v Plenty</em> might not offer as
                    a reliable authority since the claim was not contested and the decision was
                    allegedly based on a misreading of <em>France v Clark</em>
                    (1881) 26 Ch D 257 (“<em>France v
                    Clark</em>”). He further relied on <em>Hunter v
                        Hunter</em> [1936] AC 222 (“<em>Hunter v
                        Hunter</em>”) to demonstrate that the cases do not support the
                    “broad proposition put forward in <em>Harrold v
                        Plenty”</em>. However, on any examination of <em>France v Clark</em> or <em>Hunter v Hunter</em>,
                    it is clear that the principal issue in both cases concerned the propriety of
                    the <em>exercise</em> of the power of sale by an equitable
                    mortgagee. In fact, in <em>France v Clark</em> at 262 and
                        <em>Hunter v Hunter</em> at 249, the courts proceeded
                    on the basis that the deposit of the shares together with the signed share
                    transfer form gave rise to an equitable mortgage. The defendants’
                    submissions on <em>France v Clark</em> and <em>Hunter v Hunter</em> properly belong to the issue relating to
                    the <em>exercise</em> of the power of sale which I will
                    address separately below at <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a>–<a href="#p1_111">[111]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Possessory lien</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The <em>spectre</em> of
                    the possessory lien was raised by Mr Chacko during the hearing without any
                    supporting authority. I indicated my preliminary view that the concept of a
                    possessory lien might not apply to shares. Despite the time given for additional
                    research, this submission was repeated in the defendants’ further written
                    submissions without any substantive authority other than definitions extracted
                    from various legal dictionaries. Mr Chacko did not attempt any argument or
                    furnish any authority to distinguish the preponderance of local and English
                    authorities and leading textbooks that a deposit of share certificates
                    accompanied by a signed blank share transfer form gives rise to an equitable
                    mortgage. As I have explained at <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> above,
                    his reliance on <em>France v Clark</em> and <em>Hunter v Hunter</em> in fact support the settled principle of
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     As a convenient starting point, ELG Tyler and
                    NE Palmer, <em>Crossley Vaines’ Personal
                        Property</em> (Butterworths, 5th Ed, 1973) at p 137 (“Crossley
                    Vaines”) provides a useful summary of the different kinds of lien:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are a number of different kinds of lien. There are judicial and
                        statutory liens, maritime liens (binding ships for the payment of
                        seamen’s wages, salvage and the like), equitable liens (unpaid
                        vendor’s lien on a sale of land or shares (a), partner’s lien on
                        dissolution, etc.), and the lien of the unpaid seller of goods...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The classic definition of a common law lien is
                    that by Grose J in <em>Hammonds and Another, Executors of
                        Blight v Barclay and Others, Assignees of Fentham a Bankrupt</em>
                    (1802) 102 ER 356, namely that it is a right in one man to retain that which is
                    in his possession belonging to another, till certain demands of him, the person
                    in possession, are satisfied. A lien differs from a mortgage in that the
                    ownership of the goods does not pass, and from a pledge in that it bestows no
                    right of sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Crossley Vaines categorised possessory liens
                    into (a) <em>General Liens</em> and (b) <em>Particular Liens</em>. Alfred H Silvertown, <em>The
                        Law of Lien</em> (Butterworths, 1988) at 19 states that general
                    possessory liens can exist as a common law right arising from general usage or
                    by express agreement. General liens are such that those entitled to them may
                    retain in their possession the goods of others until all claims against the
                    latter are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In contrast, a <em>particular</em> lien is a right to retain chattels until all charges
                    incurred in respect thereof have been paid. As stated by <em>Halbury’s Laws of England</em> vol 68 (LexisNexis, 5th Ed,
                    2008) (“Halsbury”) at [818], particular liens are favoured by the
                    law and may arise in the same manner as general liens. The particular possessory
                    lien arises because work has been done upon the chattel and is exercisable
                    against the owner. Anyone who works on a chattel, in consideration of an agreed
                    price or with reference to an implied contract to pay a reasonable sum, may
                    retain the chattel until the price is paid. Of note, Crossley Vaines sets out
                    the following requirements to satisfy a claim for a particular lien at p
                    140:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_a"></a>(a)     The work must improve the chattel,
                        mere maintenance is insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_b"></a>(b)     No lien arises unless the work is done at the request of
                        the owner or his agent. No lien is acquired by merely finding a chattel and
                        maintaining it. There is no right of salvage at common
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_c"></a>(c)     No lien exists
                        for storage or keep. If the depositee does no work on the chattel but spends
                        money on it at the request of the owner, he must recover the money from the
                        owner of the action, for he has no lien therefor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_d"></a>(d)     A lien claimed in respect of work done
                        on a chattel arises only upon completion of the work, unless completion is
                        prevented by the owner, in which case a lien arises for the work actually
                        done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Mr Chacko, in his submissions, did not
                    specify which type of possessory lien he was referring to. However, it is
                    manifest that he could not be referring to a particular lien since there can be
                    no question of “improvement” to the Pledged Shares. Likewise,
                    there is no suggestion of any agreement or usage by custom to satisfy the
                    elements of a general lien at common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In the present case, from the objective
                    evidence before me, the parties evidently intended SBI SG to have a security
                    interest in the Pledged Shares. Not only were the Share Certificates deposited
                    with SBI SG together with the blank transfer form signed by Rainforest, both
                    Rainforest and eSys wrote to SBI SG to confirm that the deposit of the Share
                    Certificates was to provide security for the loan under the Facility Agreement.
                    In addition, a charge over the Pledged Shares was duly registered by Rainforest.
                    In these circumstances, it is clear beyond peradventure that SBI SG are the
                    equitable mortgagees of the Pledged Shares. In effect, Mr Chacko’s
                    incorrect use of the term “possessory lien” was probably in
                    support of his argument that the deposit of share certificates was merely an
                    “administrative formality” (see <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>–<a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above). If
                    it was merely for “safekeeping” (which is in essence
                    Mr Chacko’s submission), there would be no conceivable reason for
                    Rainforest to have signed the share transfer form in blank, registered a charge
                    over the Pledged Shares in favour of SBI SG or confirmed to SBI SG that the
                    shares were deposited to provide security for the loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Power of sale pursuant to an equitable mortgage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Having determined that SBI SG is an equitable
                    mortgagee in respect of the Pledged Shares, I direct my attention to discuss the
                    enforcement rights of an equitable mortgagee, in particular, the power of sale.
                    A mortgagee’s power of sale typically arises in three situations:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">by an express contractual provision in the
                            security document;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">by way of statute, <em>ie</em>, s 24(1)(a) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property
                            Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”) if the mortgage was
                            made by deed; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">by operation of law.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     SBI SG submitted that under both English and
                    Singapore authorities a power of sale under an equitable mortgage is implied by
                    operation of law <em>upon default</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In <em>Harrold v
                        Plenty</em>, having decided that an equitable mortgage arose by
                    deposit of the share certificates, Cozens-Hardy MR noted that in a mortgage
                    where there was no express power of sale, a right to sell was implied by
                    operation of law after giving reasonable notice to the mortgagor. Similarly in
                        <em>Deverges v Sandeman, Clarke &amp; Co</em> [1902] 1
                    Ch 579 (“<em>Deverges</em>”), the defendant
                    stockbrokers took instructions on two occasions from their client to purchase
                    400 shares and subsequently 300 more shares in a company. A charge was
                    placed on the shares for the sum owing by the client with interest accruing at
                    six per cent. Upon the client’s failure to make payment, the shares were
                    transferred to the stockbrokers and registered in their names. The stockbrokers
                    sought to recover the unpaid purchase money by selling the shares that were
                    registered in their names. The client commenced an action against the
                    stockbrokers after discovering the sale of the shares. The English Court of
                    Appeal proceeded on the agreed basis that the defendants were equitable
                    mortgagees and dealt with the specific question of whether a mortgagee of shares
                    had an implied power to sell the shares upon default. The decision of the court
                    turned on whether or not the notice given by the defendants was reasonable. The
                    court held at 588 and 596:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Now the defendants, being mortgagees, have in equity,
                            notwithstanding their legal title to the shares, no estate sufficient to
                            enable them to sell, and thus exclude the mortgagor from his equitable
                            right to redeem, unless there is either an express or an implied power
                            of sale in the mortgage</em>. In the present case there is no
                        express power of sale, and we have, therefore, to ascertain whether or not
                        there is, in the circumstances of this case, an implied power of sale. I
                        wish at once to say that I do not think that the circumstances which will
                        give rise to an implication of a power of sale in favour of a mortgagee of a
                        chattel, or even of stock or shares, can differ in favour of the mortgagee
                        from those which are necessary to give a right of sale to a pledgee.
                            <em>In both cases the creditor holding security is
                            allowed, as against the debtor in default, to enlarge his interest or
                            estate</em>. In the case of a pledge, whether of chattels or of
                        stock or shares, a power of sale is implied at law if a day is fixed by the
                        contract for the payment of the debt; for in such a case it is inferred that
                        the contract between the parties is that, if the borrower do not repay the
                        advance, the lender shall be at liberty to reimburse himself by the sale of
                        the thing pledged<em>. In the case of a mortgage in which
                            there is a fixed day for payment and default in payment, a similar power
                            of sale would seem to arise, if not in the case of a mortgage of a
                            chattel, at all events in the case of a mortgage of stock or
                            shares</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think it is settled law – vide <em>Tucker v
                            Wilson</em> 1 P. Wms. 261 that the mortgagees have a power of
                        sale, provided that a reasonable time has elapsed after notice requiring
                        payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In determining whether an implied power of
                    sale arose in <em>Deverges</em> (as no time for payment had
                    been fixed), the court considered the length of the notice period necessary to
                    ensure that the purchaser was afforded the opportunity to redeem the shares by
                    settling the debt owed. If time for payment is fixed, the power of sale can be
                    exercised upon default. In the case where no time for payment is fixed, the
                    power of sale could be exercised upon the expiration of a reasonable time.
                    Before me, a charge has been registered over the Pledged Shares in favour of SBI
                    SG. Further, there was a fixed date of payment stipulated under the Facility
                    Agreement. There can be no question that the power of sale has arisen given my
                    earlier finding at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>–<a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above that an event of default has
                    occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The effect of the Articles of Association on a mortgagee’s
                power of sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     To begin with, it is pertinent to highlight
                    that SBI SG accepts that the sale of the Pledged Shares must be carried out in
                    compliance with the eSys Articles. Therefore there is no issue of any sale
                    taking place without having to comply with the eSys Articles. Nevertheless,
                    Mr Chacko sought to persuade this court that SBI SG does not have the
                    requisite documentation or waivers to enforce the security on the Pledged Shares
                    or to exercise its power of sale. He identified four alleged shortcomings in SBI
                    SG’s power of sale:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_a"></a>(a)     Rainforest had not signed any formal
                        documentation to mortgage or granted a legal charge over the Pledged Shares
                        to SBI SG.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_b"></a>(b)     Rainforest had not waived any of the relevant provisions of the Articles
                        relating to the sale or transfer of eSys’s shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_c"></a>(c)     Rainforest had not granted any power
                        of attorney to SBI SG to authorise or empower SBI SG to take any action on
                        its behalf to sell or deal with the Pledged Shares in the event of default
                        by Teledata/Baytech of its obligations under the Facility
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_d"></a>(d)     Rainforest had not signed any document granting SBI SG the power to sell
                        the Pledged Shares on its behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Further, the defendants averred that a mere
                    pledge of shares by the deposit of share certificates and blank share transfer
                    forms with a creditor is insufficient to grant the creditor a right to sell the
                    deposited shares where the Articles of the company whose shares are pledged
                    contain restrictions on their transfer or sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Before examining the authorities cited by
                    Mr Chacko, it is apposite to make a few preliminary observations. It is
                    irrelevant for the defendants to submit that Rainforest had not waived
                    compliance with the eSys Articles relating to the sale or transfer of Pledged
                    Shares. No such argument was mounted by SBI SG to this effect who has in any
                    event confirmed its intention to sell the Pledged Shares in conformity with the
                    eSys Articles. The other three objections raised by Mr Chacko related to
                    the absence of formal documentation granting the power of sale. An equitable
                    mortgage by its nature typically arises by operation of law in the absence of
                    formal documentation. If Mr Chacko is right, it would follow that shares
                    which are the subject of an equitable mortgage, which does not expressly provide
                    for a power of sale, cannot be enforced. I am not aware of any authority to
                    support such a wide proposition. In fact, the authorities are to the
                    contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Finally, Mr Chacko’s submission
                    also fails to recognise the distinction between the <em>accrual</em> of the power of sale and the <em>exercise</em> of the power of sale. The important distinction was
                    spelt out in the Australian case of <em>Elders Forestry Ltd v
                        Bosi Security Services Ltd &amp; Others</em> [2010] SASC 223 where the
                    court at [147] held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>An equitable mortgagee of shares has an implied power
                            of sale on default. The exercise of such a power does not involve the
                            vesting of the shares in the mortgagee prior to sale. A mortgagee must,
                            in exercising the power of sale, comply with procedures prescribed by
                            the company’s constitution</em>. An equitable mortgagee is
                        also entitled to foreclosure which is effected by order of the court. The
                        effect is to extinguish the mortgagor’s equity of redemption and to
                        vest the entire beneficial ownership in the mortgagee. Any subsequent sale
                        by the mortgagee will be in his capacity as a beneficial owner. Foreclosure
                        operates to vest only the equitable interest. The legal title to shares
                        depends upon registration on the company’s share register. The
                        entitlement of the mortgagee to registration and legal title is subject to
                        restrictions on transferability in the constitution of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Adelaide Building Co Pte Lrd (in
                            liquidation) v ABC Investments Pty Ltd</em> (1900) 8 ACLC 445 at
                        448-9, King CJ held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The mortgagee can receive no more a security than the mortgagor has to
                            transfer. In the present case the property transferred by way of
                            security whether shares, subject to the restrictions on transferability
                            which are an incident of those shares. Those restrictions on
                            transferability are as binding on the mortgagee as they are on the
                            mortgagor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Mr Chacko cited several decisions in
                    aid of his proposition that an implied power of sale does not arise in respect
                    of the Pledged Shares given the restrictions of sale and transfer under the eSys
                    Articles. First, Mr Chacko relied on <em>France v
                        Clark</em>, where France, the registered holder of ten fully paid up
                    shares, deposited the certificates together with a signed blank transfer of the
                    shares with Clark as security for a loan for 150 pounds. The Articles of
                    Association of the company required that all transfers should be subject to the
                    approval of the directors. Clark then used the share certificates as security
                    for his own debts to Quihampton for the sum of 250 pounds and in so doing,
                    transferred the benefit of his equitable mortgage by deposit to Quihampton.
                    Clark passed away shortly thereafter. Without communicating with France,
                    Quihampton filled in his own name as transferee of the shares and sent them for
                    registration to the company. The issue before the court was whether Quihampton
                    became the purchaser for valuable consideration without notice of France’s
                    rights when he filled in the blanks in the share transfer. The court rejected
                    the argument that France, by the deposit of the shares and the signed blank
                    transfer, had enabled Clark to represent himself as the true owner or the person
                    having the power to deal with the shares as owner because the share transfer
                    form itself showed that Clark was not the owner. The court held that Quihamption
                    merely stepped into the shoes of Clark as equitable mortgagee and accordingly,
                    the share transfer to himself as owner was a nullity. This decision provides no
                    assistance to the defendants for various reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    First, before me there is no issue of SBI SG
                    transferring the Pledged Shares to itself as owner. Instead, SBI SG is taking
                    steps to sell the Pledged Shares as an equitable mortgagee with the
                    court’s assistance and in compliance with the eSys Articles. Secondly, SBI
                    SG is not claiming to have ownership rights over the Pledged Shares unlike in
                        <em>France v Clark</em>. Instead it is merely seeking
                    to enforce its rights as equitable mortgagee which was what the court held
                    Quihampton was entitled to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The defendants’ reliance on <em>Hunter v Hunter</em> is also misguided. There, the plaintiff
                    as registered owner of the shares, deposited the shares as security for a loan
                    from the bank. The plaintiff signed a continuing guarantee to the bank and also
                    a memorandum of charge whereby he charged in favour of the bank all the shares
                    certificates which were deposited as security for payment on demand of the
                    monies due to the bank. The memorandum of charge contained an express power
                    enabling the bank to sell or dispose of any of the shares in the event of
                    default. The shares were of a private company containing restrictions in its
                    Articles of Association on the transfer of shares. The bank was aware of the
                    restrictions in the Articles of Association, but transferred the shares in
                    violation of the mechanism set out therein. The House of Lords eventually held
                    that the transfers were void for having been made in contravention of the
                    Articles of Association of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Next, the defendants relied on <em>Sing Eng (Pte) Ltd v PIC Property Ltd</em> [1990] 1 SLR(R)
                    792 (“<em>Sing Eng (Pte) Ltd”</em>). In that
                    case, there were two principal issues before the court. The first concerned the
                    definition of “the person aggrieved” within the meaning of s 194
                    of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1988 Rev Ed) which is not relevant in the instant
                    case. The second concerned the interpretation of the Articles of Association of
                    the plaintiff company, specifically the ambit of the phrase “other person
                    entitled to transfer”. In <em>Sing Eng (Pte)
                        Ltd</em>, the bank which was the equitable mortgagee of the pledged
                    shares acting on the express power of sale under the memorandum of charge
                    transferred the shares to its nominee who then purported to sell the shares to
                    the respondent in breach of the mechanism set out in the Articles of
                    Association. The company applied to set aside the transfer. Against this
                    background, the issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the transfer was
                    carried out in conformity with the Articles of Association and that issue turned
                    on the question of whether the bank as equitable mortgagee was a “person
                    entitled to transfer” the shares. In that context, the Court of Appeal
                    held that a “person entitled to transfer” means the person who is
                    not a member of the company but who is entitled <em>under the
                        articles</em> to transfer shares of the company. The Articles of
                    Association specifically identified the categories of “persons”
                    who were entitled to transfer the shares and the same did not include an
                    equitable mortgagee. In addition, the transfer was held at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> to be void because as equitable mortgagee,
                    the bank was in no position to transfer the legal title in the shares. The Court
                    of Appeal at [21] and [27] also attached considerable significance
                    to the fact that under the transfer notice, the bank purported to transfer the
                    shares in its own right and not on behalf of the registered owners of the
                    shares. The Court of Appeal decided that a sale or transfer notice which was not
                    given in accordance with the pre-emption provisions of the Articles of
                    Association was ineffectual and any subsequent transfer in breach of the
                    provisions was inoperative. Here, there is presently no transfer notice to speak
                    of. In any event, SBI SG has stated that it intends to give the transfer notice
                    as agent for Rainforest unlike the defective transfer notice that was provided
                    by the bank in its own right in <em>Sing Eng (Pte)
                    Ltd</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Finally, Mr Chacko referred to the case
                    of <em>Xiamen International Bank and others v Sing Eng (Pte)
                        Ltd</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 176 (“<em>Xiamen
                        International Bank”)</em> which was the continuation of the
                    saga following the decision in <em>Sing Eng (Pte) Ltd</em>.
                    After the holding of the Court of Appeal in <em>Sing Eng (Pte)
                        Ltd</em>, the bank, on six separate occasions, unsuccessfully
                    attempted to register the shares in the name of its nominee. The bank thereafter
                    obtained a declaration that the shares were held on trust by the registered
                    shareholders on behalf of the bank. Armed with the declaration, the bank sought
                    once again, to rectify the register of shareholders on the basis that the bank
                    was the lawful attorney of the registered shareholders with powers to do all
                    acts in their names to dispose of their shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In <em>Xiamen International
                        Bank</em>, the pre-emption rights as provided under Art 34 of the
                    Articles of Association stipulated the following procedure:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except where the transfer is made pursuant to arts 33, 36 and 43, hereof,
                        a person proposing to transfer any share (hereinafter called the proposing
                        transferor) shall give notice in writing (hereinafter called the transfer
                        notice) to the company that he desires to transfer the same. Such notice
                        shall specify the sum he fixes as the fair value, and shall constitute the
                        company his agent for the sale of the share to any member of the company at
                        the price so fixed or at the option of the purchaser, at the fair value to
                        be fixed by the auditors of the company. The transfer notice shall not be
                        revocable except with the sanction of the directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant company in reliance on the Articles of Association
                    objected to the application on several grounds, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, (a) the transfer notice had no legal effect because the
                    sale had <em>preceded</em> the notice, (b) the pre-emption
                    price in the transfer notice was exorbitant and (c) that it was
                    “fictitious” for the bank to state in the transfer notice that it
                    was acting as attorneys for the registered shareholders in the sale since the
                    registered shareholders have already placed on record that they had not
                    appointed the bank as attorneys. It should be highlighted that the application
                    before the court was not to sanction the sale but to rectify the register of
                    shareholders on the basis that the bank, as lawful attorneys of the registered
                    shareholders had the power to sell the shares. Further, each of the objections
                    raised by the defendant company related to the <em>exercise</em> of the bank’s rights to sell the shares and each
                    of them was rejected by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In <em>Xiamen International
                        Bank</em>, in response to one of the defendant company’s
                    objections that the name of the transferor stated in the transfer form was
                    defective in that it purported to have been signed by the bank as lawful
                    attorneys of the registered shareholders, the court observed that under the
                    guarantees executed by the registered shareholders, there was an express clause
                    which stipulated that for the purposes of enabling the bank to sell the shares,
                    the registered shareholders have appointed the bank as their lawful attorneys to
                    “sell, realize, transfer or otherwise dispose” of the shares. On
                    the strength of this holding, Mr Chacko submitted that without a proper
                    power of attorney, SBI SG has no power to sell the shares. This objection is
                    misconceived. First, there is nothing in <em>Xiamen International
                        Bank</em> to suggest that without such a power of attorney, an
                    equitable mortgagee like SBI SG has no power to sell the Pledged Shares.
                    Further, I agree with Mr Pillai that the problem which confronted the bank
                    in <em>Xiamen International Bank</em> does not arise here
                    since any transfer or sale of the Pledged Shares would be by Rainforest as it
                    had already signed the share transfer form as the transferor. Secondly, in that
                    case the sale had already taken place in the name of the registered shareholders
                    by the bank acting as their lawful attorneys. Before me, the sale of the Pledged
                    Shares has not taken place and consequently, there is no issue of SBI SG selling
                    the Pledged Shares as the lawful attorneys of eSys.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In <em>Kong Swee
                        Eng</em>, the plaintiff argued that if an equitable mortgage was not
                    made by deed, then the only way that an equitable mortgagee can sell the legal
                    interest of the mortgaged property, <em>ie</em>, the
                    shares, is by applying to court for a sale under s 30(2) of the CLPA.
                    In support, the plaintiff’s counsel in that case referred me to two
                    passages from leading textbooks on the subject. The first passage is found in
                    Fisher and Lightwood at para 30.43:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of an equitable mortgage not made by deed, there is no
                        statutory power of sale. If the mortgagee wishes to sell, he must therefore
                        apply to the court, which will be able to vest in him a legal term of years,
                        so he can sell as if he were a legal mortgagee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The other passage is from Edward F Cousins and Ian Clarke, <em>The Law of Mortgages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2001)
                    at para 16-121:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of other equitable mortgages not made by deed, there is no
                        statutory power of sale out of court. However, by virtue of section 91(2) of
                        the Law of Property Act 1925, the court itself has the power to order a
                        judicial sale on the application of the mortgagee or of any interested
                        person and may vest a legal term of years in the mortgagee so that he can
                        sell as if he were a legal mortgagee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The submission was rejected by me and at
                        [50] in <em>Kong Swee
                        Eng</em>, I observed that obtaining a power of attorney was <em>one method</em> whereby the equitable mortgagee can transfer
                    the legal title in the shares to the purchaser without assistance from the
                    court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, what these two passages really meant, in my judgment, was that,
                        in a situation where the mortgage was not made by deed, an equitable
                        mortgagee who has no <em>other</em> power or mechanism
                        to convey the legal title out of court would simply have no choice but to
                        apply to court to sell or convey the legal title. Examples of such
                        mechanisms that allow the transfer of the legal title out of court can be
                        found in mortgage instruments and include: the granting of a power of
                        attorney to the equitable mortgagee to convey the legal interest (<em>Re White Rose Cottage</em>
                        [1965] 1 Ch 940), or a declaration by the mortgagor that he
                        holds the legal interest on trust for the mortgagee (<em>London and County Banking Co v
                        Goddard </em>[1897] 1 Ch 642).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Absent formal documentation such as a power
                    of attorney, SBI SG may have to seek the court’s assistance to convey the
                    legal title in the Pledged Shares to any purchaser whether nominated by the
                    Directors of eSys or any other party in default thereof. That issue is currently
                    not before me and I shall say no more. Suffice it to say that there are various
                    ways for an equitable mortgagee such as SBI SG to enforce its security in the
                    Pledged Shares. Obtaining a power of attorney is certainly one route but is
                    clearly not the only method. Another possible course is to apply to court under
                    s 30(2) of the CLPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In the final analysis, it is clear that
                        <em>France v Clark</em>, <em>Hunter v
                        Hunter</em> and <em>Sing Eng (Pte) Ltd</em>
                    concerned the sale or transfer of shares executed by the equitable mortgagee
                    without complying with the Articles of Association while <em>Xiamen International Bank</em> concerned the <em>exercise</em> of the power of sale. These cases do not assist the
                    defendants given that there is no completed sale or transfer before me and in
                    any event, SBI SG has emphatically reiterated its position that it intends to
                    sell the Pledged Shares in accordance with the eSys Articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The exercise of the power of sale with reference to the eSys Articles </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In the present case, the mechanism for the
                    transfer of shares envisioned by the eSys Articles is governed by the following
                    relevant provisions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 24</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The directors may in their <em>absolute
                            discretion</em> and without giving any reason therefore decline to
                        register any transfer of shares to a person of whom they do not approve and
                        may also decline to register any transfer of shares on which the company has
                        a lien.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 28</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Shares may be freely transferred by a member or other person entitled to
                        transfer to any existing member selected by the transferor, but save as
                        aforesaid and save as provided by Article 33 hereof, no share shall be
                        transferred to a person who is not a member so long as any member <em>or any person selected by the directors as one whom it is
                            desirable in the interest of the Company to admit to membership is
                            willing to purchase the same at the fair value</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 29</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except where the transfer is made pursuant to Article 33 hereof the person
                        proposing to transfer any shares (hereinafter called “the proposing
                        transferor” shall give notice in writing (hereinafter called
                        “the transfer notice”) to the Company that he desires to
                        transfer the same. <em>Such notice shall specify the sum he
                            fixes as the fair value</em>, and <em>shall
                            constitute the Company his agents for the sale of the share to any
                            member of the Company or persons selected as aforesaid, at the price so
                            fixed, or at the option of the purchaser, at the fair value to be fixed
                            by the auditor in accordance with these articles</em>. A transfer
                        notice may include several shares, and in such case shall operate as if it
                        were a separate notice in respect of each. The transfer notice shall not be
                        revocable except with the sanction of the directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 30</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the Company shall within three months after service of a sale notice
                        find a member willing to purchase any share comprised therein (hereinafter
                        described as a “purchasing member”) and shall give notice
                        thereof to the retiring member, the retiring member shall be bound upon
                        payment of the fair value to transfer the share to such purchasing member,
                        who shall be bound to complete the purchase within seven days from the
                        service of such last mentioned notice. The Directors shall, with a view to
                        finding a purchasing member, offer any shares comprised in a sale notice to
                        the persons then holding the remaining shares in the Company as nearly as
                        may be in proportion to their holdings of shares in the Company, and shall
                        limit a time within which such offer if not accepted will be deemed to be
                        declined and the Directors shall make such arrangements as regards the
                        finding of a purchasing member for any shares not accepted by a member to
                        whom they shall have been offered as aforesaid within the time so limited as
                        they shall think just and reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 33</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the directors shall not, within the space of three months after service
                        of a sale notice, find a purchasing member of all or any of the shares
                        comprised therein and give notice in a manner aforesaid, or if through no
                        default of the retiring member, the purchase of any shares in respect of
                        which such last-mentioned notice shall be given shall not be completed
                        within twenty-one days from the service of such notice the retiring member
                        shall, at any time within six months thereafter, be at liberty to sell and
                        transfer the share comprised in his sale notice (or such of them as shall
                        not have been sold to a purchasing member) to any person at any
                        price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Although Article 24 stipulates that the
                    directors may in their “absolute discretion” decline to register
                    the transfer of shares, the law is clear that the exercise of such discretion is
                    reviewable by reason of s 128(2) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    which provides that a company shall not refuse to register a transfer of shares
                    by virtue of any discretion conferred by the Articles “unless it has
                    served on the applicant, within one month beginning on the day on which the
                    application was made, a notice in writing stating the facts which are considered
                    to justify refusal in the exercise of that discretion.” Judith
                    Prakash J in <em>Xiamen International Bank</em> held
                    that once reasons are given by the company for the manner in which the
                    discretion has been exercised, the court may review the sufficiency of the
                    reasons. Mr Chacko has not suggested otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Mr Pillai submitted that the nature of
                    a pre-emption right is a right of a shareholder to acquire shares in the company
                    in preference to any other person. Thus if the company is wholly owned by a
                    single shareholder, <em>ie</em>, a wholly owned subsidiary,
                    and the holding company wishes to sell part of its shares, the rights of
                    pre-emption do not come into play as there is no other shareholder or member who
                    can exercise the pre-emption rights to purchase the shares. However under
                    Article 28, as Mr Pillai has rightly pointed out, the pre-emption rights
                        <em>do not only</em> contemplate the sale of shares to
                        <em>other</em> members (of which there is none in a
                    wholly owned subsidiary with a single shareholder). Instead it also extends to
                    non-members, as the directors of eSys faced with a potential sale, are accorded
                    the opportunity to put forward a person, deemed desirable, to purchase the
                    shares within the time period stipulated, failing which the sale could proceed
                        <em>vis-a-vis</em> any third party. Thus Article 28
                    effectively confers on the directors of eSys the power to grant a right of
                    first-refusal to a non-member whom they deemed desirable to purchase the shares.
                    SBI SG takes no issue with eSys nominating another “<em>desirable</em>” person to purchase the Pledged Shares. Its
                    interest is to ensure that the sale is at a fair value which now takes me to the
                    last issue of whether I should order a valuation of the Pledged Shares to
                    facilitate a sale in compliance with the eSys Articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Access to books and records of eSys for valuation of the Pledged
                Shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Article 29 provides that any person
                    proposing to transfer shares of eSys is required to serve a notice in writing
                    (“transfer notice”) specifying a fair value of the shares. On
                    receipt of such notice, eSys shall act as agent for the transferor in the sale
                    to “<em>any member of the Company or persons selected as
                        aforesaid, at the price so fixed, or at the option of the purchaser, at the
                        fair value to be fixed by the auditor in accordance with these
                        articles</em>” [emphasis added]. Typically, if the transferor
                    is an existing shareholder, he or she would have access to some information to
                    fix the fair value of the shares. Further, Art 29 also contemplates the
                    appointment of an auditor to fix the fair value at the option of the purchaser.
                    This option is presumably invoked when the intended purchaser disagrees with the
                    fair value stated in the transfer notice. How would such a procedure operate in
                    the context of SBI SG enforcing its security in the Pledged
                Shares?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In its Amended OS, SBI SG has sought an
                    order for access to all books and records of eSys as may be reasonably required
                    to carry out a valuation of the Pledged Shares. SBI SG is essentially seeking
                    ancillary orders to facilitate the <em>eventual</em> sale
                    of the Pledged Shares. SBI SG’s declared intention is to sell the Pledged
                    Shares in accordance with the eSys Articles. Under Art 29, SBI SG is required to
                    state a fair value for the Pledged Shares. SBI SG being the equitable mortgagee
                    has no access to the books and records of eSys to enable it to fix a fair value
                    in the transfer notice. To do so, it is imperative for SBI SG to conduct a
                    proper valuation to arrive at a fair value. As such, any intended sale by SBI SG
                    cannot be properly carried out in accordance with the eSys Articles without a
                    proper valuation first being conducted. From SBI SG’s perspective, the
                    identity of the eventual purchaser is not critical (except that the purchaser
                    must have the means to complete the sale). SBI SG’s principal focus is to
                    sell the Pledged Shares at a fair value. Therefore while it is entirely within
                    the power of eSys’s directors to nominate a “<em>desirable person</em>” to acquire the Pledged Shares, the
                    defendants should not obstruct the necessary process of determining the fair
                    value of the Pledged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The defendants argued that as Arts 29 and 33
                    governed the valuation of the Pledged Shares, SBI SG has no right in law or in
                    fact to inspect eSys’s books and records. The defendants argued that these
                    provisions were actually designed to prevent an intending seller or purchaser
                    from seeking access to the accounts and records of eSys whilst ensuring that
                    “an agreed upon third party expert”, an auditor, would be given
                    the access instead. They argued that this mechanism was intended to maintain the
                    confidentiality of eSys’s documents and records. In the absence of any
                    valuation of the Pledged Shares, SBI SG could face the unfair situation of
                    stating a value which may be lower than the actual value of the Pledged Shares.
                    Given the history of the dispute, I can see real benefits to both parties for an
                    independent valuation to be conducted. This would certainly eliminate another
                    potential area of dispute. In light of the concerns expressed by eSys, I direct
                    the parties to agree on the appointment of a joint independent auditor to
                    determine a fair value of the Pledged Shares, failing which the court will
                    appoint one on behalf of the parties. In this way, SBI SG would not have direct
                    access to the books and records of eSys and consequently the confidentiality of
                    the books and records of eSys can be preserved while at the same time, a proper
                    valuation of the Pledged Shares can be undertaken. By making this order, I am in
                    fact ensuring that the sale of the Pledged Shares, if and when it takes place,
                    would be carried out in conformity with the eSys Articles. Without a proper
                    valuation, SBI SG would not be able to state a fair value of the Pledged Shares
                    in the transfer notice as required under Art 29 of the eSys Articles. SBI SG
                    contemplates the need to seek the court’s assistance to give effect to the
                    sale and transfer of the Pledged Shares pending the outcome of the
                    defendants’ reaction to the prospective transfer notice. Hopefully the
                    saga of <em>Sing Eng (Pte) Ltd</em> and <em>Xiamen International Bank</em> will not repeat itself.</p>
