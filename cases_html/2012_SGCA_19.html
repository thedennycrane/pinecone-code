                    brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Having heard the submissions for the appeal, we
                    reserved judgment and now deliver our judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The arrest of the Appellant, Tamil and Bala was
                    made on 28 April 2007 at the car park in front of Block 108 Yishun
                    Ring Road (“the Yishun car park”). The Appellant, Tamil and Bala
                    were friends. At the time of the arrest, the Appellant was running an operation
                    of collecting carton boxes at Tekka Market for a living, while Bala was
                    operating a shop in the same vicinity. Tamil had been released from a Singapore
                    prison almost a year earlier and had no settled occupation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 27 April 2007, the Appellant, Tamil and
                    Bala, together with three other friends (<em>viz</em>,
                    Sundrammurthy s/o Vellasamy (“Sundrammurthy”),
                    Sundrammurthy’s brother, Kumaran s/o Vellasamy (“Kumaran”),
                    and Kumaranathan s/o Silvasamy (“Kumar”)), met in Johor Bahru for
                    a night of drinks and karaoke. Their means of transport from Singapore to Johor
                    Bahru for the night out were two motor vehicles: a blue Mitsubishi Lancer motor
                    car bearing vehicle registration number SGT 809 X rented by the
                    Appellant one month before his arrest,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and a black Honda
                    Civic motor car bearing vehicle registration number SCQ 143 X owned by
                        Sundrammurthy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> According to the Appellant, all six
                    persons stayed at a karaoke lounge in Johor Bahru until around 6.30am the
                    following morning (<em>ie</em>, the morning of
                    28 April 2007). All six persons returned to Singapore at around 7.25am that
                    same morning<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> in the two said cars without any
                    incident at the Singapore customs checkpoint. At the time, the Appellant was
                    driving SGT 809 X (with Bala and Tamil as passengers), while
                    Sundrammurthy was driving SCQ 143 X (with Kumaran and Kumar as
                    passengers).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Upon returning to Singapore on 28 April
                    2007, the drivers of the two cars drove directly to the Yishun car park. Upon
                    reaching the Yishun car park at around 7.55am, Sundrammurthy handed the keys to
                    SCQ 143 X over to Tamil, who, according to the Appellant, had borrowed
                    SCQ 143 X from Sundrammurthy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Sundrammurthy,
                    Kumaran and Kumar were then given a lift in SGT 809 X by the Appellant
                    and dropped off at a nearby main road. Bala was also present in
                    SGT 809 X during the drop-off. Tamil alone stayed behind at the Yishun
                    car park while the drop-off was taking place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The events that followed were observed by
                    several Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers (“the CNB
                    surveillance officers”), who had secretly been keeping the party under
                    surveillance from the time the two cars entered Singapore on the morning of
                    28 April 2007. The Appellant and Bala returned to the Yishun car park in
                    SGT 809 X after Sundrammurthy, Kumaran and Kumar were dropped off at
                    the nearby main road. Upon their return, both SGT 809 X and
                    SCQ 143 X were shifted such that they were parked next to each other
                    at the Yishun car park. The Appellant, Tamil and Bala then remained in close
                    proximity of the two cars for some time, during which the Appellant was seen
                    revving up the engine of SCQ 143 X several times. The CNB surveillance
                    officers testified that smoke appeared to have been emitted from the exhaust
                    pipe of SCQ 143 X while the Appellant was revving up the engine.
                    Thereafter, the Appellant joined Tamil and Bala at the rear of
                    SCQ 143 X. All three persons were seen meddling with the boot and the
                    rear bumper of SCQ 143 X where the smoke-emitting exhaust pipe was
                    situated. The Appellant was then observed moving over to SGT 809 X,
                    opening its boot, taking out a blue paper bag and bringing the paper bag to the
                    rear of SCQ 143 X. The three men continued meddling with the rear
                    bumper of SCQ 143 X. A while later, Bala was seen retrieving from the
                    underside of the rear bumper of SCQ 143 X what appeared to be a
                    dark-coloured bundle. Shortly thereafter, all three men stood up and the
                    Appellant was observed carrying a blue paper bag similar to the one he had
                    earlier taken out from the boot of SGT 809 X. He brought the bag to
                    SGT 809 X and closed the boots of both cars. The Appellant then hugged
                    Tamil and Bala in turn before entering SGT 809 X alone. At that point,
                    the CNB surveillance officers moved in and arrested all three men.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After the arrest was made, the boot of
                    SGT 809 X was opened and a blue paper bag was found lying inside.
                    Inside the blue paper bag were two bundles – one bigger than the other
                    – covered in black plastic wrapping. The contents of the two bundles were
                    sent for analysis at the Health Sciences Authority (“the HSA”),
                    and the larger bundle was found to contain 1,525.7g of cannabis. The actual
                    contents of the smaller bundle were immaterial to the charge tried in the court
                    below and no finding was made in relation to those contents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Appellant, Tamil and Bala were jointly
                    charged with as well as jointly tried for the offence of drug trafficking under
                        s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) read with s 5(2) of the
                    MDA (2001 Ed). The trial of the three men lasted for a total of 26 days, in
                    the course of which two <em>voir </em><em>dires</em>, each lasting two days, were held. The <em>voir </em><em>dires</em> concerned the
                    admissibility of two self-inculpatory statements given by the Appellant on,
                    respectively, 20 August 2007 and 16 October 2007 to an investigating
                    officer, Assistant Superintendent Adam Tan (“the IO”), while being
                    held in custody at Queenstown Remand Prison. The statement made on
                    20 August 2007 was marked as “P132”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and that made on
                    16 October 2007 was marked as “P97”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> (it should also be noted
                    that P97 was the last in a series of statements made by the Appellant between
                    30 April 2007 and 16 October 2007). The contents of P132 and P97 are
                    reproduced below at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> and <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In the <em>voir
                        </em><em>dires</em>, the Appellant made several
                    serious allegations against the IO, who was the recorder of both P132 and P97.
                    The Appellant claimed that the IO had, in an interview at the Alpha Division
                    lock-up interview room in the Police Cantonment Complex on 9 May 2007,
                    threatened to implicate the Appellant’s wife if the Appellant refused to
                    co-operate with the CNB. In particular, the Appellant claimed that the IO had
                    specifically brought up the subject of an account book seized from the
                    Appellant’s residence during the CNB’s investigations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The
                    account book, which bore the handwriting of the Appellant’s wife, was, by
                    the Appellant’s own admission, used to keep records of a loan shark
                    business which the Appellant was helping his brother-in-law, one Kannan s/o
                    Subramaniam, with at the time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Appellant
                    claimed that the IO had warned him that with that account book, the IO
                    “can pull my [<em>ie</em>, the Appellant’s]
                    wife also”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> When asked by his counsel
                    to explain what he meant by the phrase “pull my wife also”, the
                    Appellant replied saying, “[the IO] claims that the content [of the
                    account book] … can prove to the Court that my wife [was] also involved
                    in the drugs”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This threat was allegedly
                    made again on 20 August 2007, when the IO, together with an interpreter,
                    Sofia binte Sufri (“the Interpreter”), visited the Appellant at
                    Queenstown Remand Prison for the purpose of serving an additional charge of
                    trafficking in ecstasy (“the ecstasy charge”) on him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Appellant further
                    alleged that the IO had also promised him that he would be spared from the death
                    penalty if he co-operated in the IO’s investigations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> That
                    was when the Appellant started responding to questions relating to his arrest
                    which were put to him by the IO on 20 August 2007. The brief contents of
                    the conversation were recorded later on that same day in the IO’s field
                    book outside Queenstown Remand Prison, and were subsequently sought to be
                    admitted in court by the Prosecution as P132. The Appellant further claimed that
                    the IO again mentioned the aforesaid threat and promise on a subsequent visit on
                    16 October 2007, whereupon the Appellant finally caved in and made the
                    self-inculpatory statement which was P97.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     After hearing all the evidence given and the
                    submissions made by the parties in each <em>voir dire</em>,
                    the Trial Judge ruled that P132 and P97 had not been procured by inducement,
                    threat or promise and were thus admissible. The Trial Judge’s reasoning in
                    respect of his decision on the admissibility of P132 is primarily found at
                    [53]–[56] of the Judgment as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    When I reviewed the
                            evidence, it was clear that defence counsel did not elicit any admission
                            from [the IO] or [the Interpreter] that any inducement, threat or
                            promise was issued or made which led [the Appellant] to make the
                            statement which [the IO] recorded in his field book [<em>ie</em>, P132].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54    [The Appellant’s] evidence … was that [the IO] had warned
                            him on 9 May 2007 that his wife may be involved with the drugs
                            because she made entries in the book that was seized, and [the IO]
                            advised him to think about that. When [the IO] saw him again on
                            20 August 2007 with [the Interpreter], [the IO] told him that if he
                            co-operated and gave information against the two co-accused, he may not
                            have to face the death penalty and his wife will not be charged and he
                            co-operated with [the IO] by telling him about his involvement and that
                            of the co-accused and his brother-in-law. He went on to add
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    [the IO] did not ask him to give a written
                                statement;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   he did not believe that the accounts book
                                will link his wife to the drugs and he was not worried over that;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   he believed that if he co-operated, he would
                                not face the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55    His evidence that after he co-operated and gave
                            [the IO] the information, [the IO] did not ask him to give a written
                            statement challenged belief. If [the IO] wanted his co-operation and he
                            co-operated, it would be natural and logical for [the IO] to ask him to
                            make a signed statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56    
              <em>I found that there was no
                                credible evidence that [the Appellant] had made the oral statement
                                to [the IO] as a result of the alleged threat and
                                promise.</em> I therefore ruled that the statement was a
                            voluntary statement and admitted it in evidence. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As for the Trial Judge’s reasons for ruling that P97 was
                    admissible, they are contained in [72]–[76] of the Judgment as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72    The defence did not call [the Appellant’s]
                            wife or his lawyer as witnesses in the second <em>voir
                                dire</em>. Consequently, the evidence that she had informed
                            [the IO] that [the Appellant] wanted to see him, and the evidence that
                            [the Appellant] had told his wife about [the IO’s] promise were
                            hearsay in the first instance and uncorroborated in the
                        second.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    [The Appellant’s] contention that by
                            16 October 2007, he believed that his wife may be implicated with
                            the drugs because [the IO] had requested his wife to see him did not
                            further his claim that [the IO] had threatened to implicate his wife.
                            All [the Appellant] had said was that his wife told him of that request,
                            and he feared that [the IO] was going to take action against her. By
                            [the Appellant’s] own evidence no threat [was] issued by [the IO].
                            With no fresh threat, we are left with the original threat to implicate
                            his wife and the promise not to implicate her, and to reduce the charge
                            against him if he co-operated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74    There were substantial differences in the
                            narrations of the events of 16 October 2007. The
                            prosecution’s case was that [the IO] wanted to inform [the
                            Appellant] of [certain] DNA findings. While [the IO’s] evidence
                            was corroborated by [the Interpreter], [the Appellant’s] evidence
                            was not backed up by his wife or his lawyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75    The prosecution’s evidence was that after the
                            statement [<em>viz</em>, P97] was recorded, it was
                            read back to [the Appellant] in Malay, and he also read it himself. [The
                            Appellant’s] evidence was that it was not only not read back to
                            him, he did not have the opportunity to read it himself, he did not ask
                            to read it, and he was content to sign it without knowing its contents.
                            I find this difficult to understand and accept. If he had signed the
                            statement as his part of the bargain with [the IO], there was no reason
                            for [the IO] not to have the statement read to him or to allow him to
                            read it. In each of the five earlier signed statements he made to [the
                            IO] it was recorded that the statement was read back to him, and [the
                            Appellant] had not denied that.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">76    
              <em>On a review of the evidence, I
                                found the evidence of [the IO] and [the Interpreter] consistent and
                                credible, but not the evidence of [the Appellant].</em>
                            Accordingly, I found that the statement [the Appellant] made was
                            voluntarily [made] without any inducement, threat or promise, and I
                            admitted it in evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Trial Judge ultimately found the Appellant
                    guilty of the offence charged, observing <em>inter
                        alia</em> (at [126] of the Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the final analysis, there was an abundance of evidence against [the
                        Appellant]. They came in the way of direct evidence and [unrebutted]
                        presumptions [under ss 17, 18(1), 18(2) and 21 of the MDA
                        (2001 Ed)]. The direct evidence was in the [CNB] surveillance
                        officers’ evidence that he took the blue paper bag to his car and his
                        admission [in P97] that his job was to sell the drugs in Singapore. This was
                        proof of his possession of the cannabis for the purpose of
                        trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For completeness, we also set out below the Trial Judge’s
                    reasoning on the statutory presumptions which he applied against the Appellant
                    (at [121] and [127] of the Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">121    [The
                            Appellant’s] defence was that he had not brought the blue paper
                            bag from SGT 809 X to SCQ 143 X, and then from
                            SCQ 143 X to SGT 809 X after the bundles were
                            retrieved by Bala, and he denied any knowledge of or dealing with the
                            bag and its contents. However, given that the cannabis was recovered
                            from SGT 809 X and that he was in possession and control of
                            the car, there is a presumption under s 18(1) of the MDA
                            [(2001 Ed)] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or
                            custody or under his control —</p>

                                    controlled drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(c)    the keys of any place or premises or any
                                    part thereof in which a controlled drug is found;
                                or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(d)    a document of title relating to a
                                    controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery
                                    of a controlled drug,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug
                            in his possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and under s 21 where:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If any controlled drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed,
                            until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of the owner of
                            the vehicle and of the person in charge of the vehicle for the time
                            being.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is also a presumption that he knew of the nature of the
                        drugs as s 18(2) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in
                            his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have
                            known the nature of that drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and both presumptions were not rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">127    In addition to that, there is also a presumption
                            under s 17 of the MDA [(2001 Ed)] that [the Appellant] had the
                            cannabis in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, which was not
                            rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Dissatisfied with the Trial Judge’s
                    verdict, the Appellant appealed against his conviction and
                sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The hearing of the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Before us, the Appellant’s counsel,
                    Mr Amolat Singh, mounted, at the outset, a root-and-branch criticism of the
                    Trial Judge’s decision below. His contentions included the following:
                    (a) the Trial Judge erred in accepting entirely the CNB surveillance
                    officers’ account (as set out at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    above) of what happened at the Yishun car park at the material time;
                    (b) the contents of two contemporaneous statements given by the Appellant
                    very shortly after his arrest (referred to hereafter as
                        “P86A”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> and
                        “P86B”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> respectively) were
                    selectively recorded by one Station Inspector Ngo Hing Wong and were therefore
                    inaccurate; and (c) the Trial Judge erred in concluding, pursuant to the
                    statutory presumptions in ss 18(1) and 21 of the MDA (2001 Ed), that
                    as the cannabis was recovered from a motor car rented by the Appellant and
                    driven by him at the material time (<em>viz</em>,
                    SGT 809 X), he was presumed to have had that drug in his possession.
                    However, as the hearing of the appeal progressed in response to our queries, the
                    following began to emerge as the crucial issue that went to the heart of this
                    appeal – whether the two self-inculpatory statements given by the
                    Appellant to the IO while in remand at Queenstown Remand Prison (<em>ie</em>, P97 and P132), for which the <em>voir
                        </em><em>dires</em> were conducted at the trial
                    below, were made voluntarily without any inducement, threat or promise by the
                    IO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     During the hearing of the appeal, we informed
                    the Appellant’s counsel and the Prosecution that we considered this to be
                    the pivotal issue because if the evidence contained in P97 and P132 were
                    excluded, the Appellant’s conviction would then factually rest on shaky
                    grounds, given that there was a palpable lack of direct and concrete evidence
                    against the Appellant apart from P97 and P132. In its response, the Prosecution
                    argued that the Appellant would still fail to discharge his burden of proof in
                    rebutting the presumptions of possession and knowledge under the MDA
                    (2001 Ed) even if P97 and P132 were ultimately ruled to be
                    inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our analysis and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The admissibility of P97 and P132</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The legislative provision that governs the
                    admissibility of P97 and P132 (which are not cautioned statements embraced by
                    s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)) is
                    s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), which was
                    repealed on 2 January 2011 following the enactment of the Criminal
                    Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010). In order to fully appreciate the
                    context of our decision on the admissibility of P97 and P132 under the relevant
                    legislative provision, it is necessary for us to first elaborate in greater
                    detail on the circumstances that gave rise to those statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As mentioned earlier, the Appellant, Tamil and
                    Bala were arrested on 28 April 2007. The IO was appointed shortly
                    thereafter to investigate the matter, and cautioned statements in relation to
                    the arrest were taken from the Appellant, Tamil and Bala (see the Judgment at

                    Remand Prison purportedly to serve on him the ecstasy charge, which stemmed from
                    the same events that led to his arrest on 28 April 2007. The ecstasy charge

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The IO’s visit on 20 August 2007,
                    it should be added, took place in the absence of the Appellant’s counsel,
                    notwithstanding that the Appellant had by then already retained counsel. This
                    was known to the IO. During the visit, the IO was accompanied by the
                    Interpreter, who had been tasked to interpret matters arising from the service
                    of the ecstasy charge. According to the IO, after he served the ecstasy charge
                    on the Appellant and recorded the Appellant’s cautioned statement, the
                    Appellant voluntarily offered in the English language to provide him certain
                    information which, despite the IO’s request, the Appellant steadfastly
                    refused to be reduced into a signed written statement. All this happened in the
                    presence of the Interpreter, who gave evidence in court corroborating the
                    IO’s version of the facts in this particular regard.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The IO subsequently
                    recorded in his field book a summary of the information given by the Appellant
                    shortly after he (the IO) left the interview room that day. As mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, the relevant pages of the
                    IO’s field book were subsequently sought to be admitted by the Prosecution
                    as P132 at the trial. The material parts of P132 read:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The Appellant] stated that he has things to say. [The Appellant] was not
                        willing to commit in a statement. He told me and [the Interpreter] verbally
                        about his arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He said he was willing to plead guilty but he wants lighter sentence. [The
                        Appellant] also indicated that his Malaysian supplier is one
                        “Mamin”. [The Appellant] stated that he was doing this to get
                        his brother-in-law out from prison. His brother-in-law is someone in Johor
                        Bahru prison currently for drug trafficking. [The Appellant] indicated that
                        he was the one who coordinated everything. Mamin informed him that the drugs
                        were in the car while he was driving back. [Bala] then removed the drugs
                        while [the Appellant] carried the … paper bag to put the drugs.
                        [Tamil] and [Bala] are involved in smuggling the drugs. [Sundrammurthy],
                        [Kumar], [Kumaran] are innocent. His [former] car wash helper, Amran is also
                        involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Subsequently, on 16 October 2007, the IO
                    (likewise together with the Interpreter) visited the Appellant again at
                    Queenstown Remand Prison to, according to the IO, seek clarification on a DNA
                    analysis report dated 1 October 2007 obtained from the HSA in connection
                    with the Appellant’s arrest (“the DNA Report”). In the
                    course of that visit, P97 was recorded by the IO and signed by the Appellant.
                    Again, inexplicably, the visit was made without notifying the Appellant’s
                    counsel. We also note that the relevant pages of the IO’s field book
                    recording this visit were not produced at the trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> P97

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70.    My brother-in-law, Kannan S/o Subramaniam
                            [(“Kannan”)], was in Sepang Regum Prison for suspected
                            drugs and guns. His case went to court in Johor. I visit my
                            brother-in-law quite often about once a week. I sometime go alone or
                            with my wife. He got out from CPC [<em>ie</em>,
                            Changi Prison Complex] in 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71.    I knew Rocky [<em>ie</em>,
                            Tamil] through my brother-in-law and I got to know Bala through
                            Rocky.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72.    In early this year, January or February, I was at
                            Kannan’s house in JB celebrating my mother-in-law’s
                            birthday. We left that night. The next morning or afternoon my
                            brother-in-law, sister-in-law (Hairun Be) and Khalid Selvam were
                            arrested. They were arrested for drug and arms offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73.    I wanted to get my brother-in-law and
                            sister-in-law out. I know that it can be done using money to pay the
                            lawyers and the authorities. Mamin, a Malay Singaporean who is wanted in
                            Singapore and who is now currently in JB, and Siva, an Indian Malaysian
                            were the ones who introduced me to drugs. They gave me the connection to
                            buy the drugs and sell it in Singapore. They also give me the clients in
                            Singapore. Mamin introduced me to heroin clients. Rocky got me the
                            cannabis clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74.    I got my heroin from Mamin and I got the cannabis
                            from Siva. I got my Ecstasy tablets from a Chinese man named Richard at
                            Taman Sentosa. Richard is wanted in Singapore. He is a
                            Singaporean.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75.    I do not have to pay upfront for the Ecstasy
                            tablets and heroin. Mamin and Richard gave them to me on credit. I have
                            to pay Siva the money for the cannabis on delivery. I do not know the
                            cost of the heroin as I have not paid Mamin yet. The cannabis cost $2500
                            ringgit for one ‘book’. I was arrested with 2
                            ‘books’. One ‘book’ is about one kilogram. I
                            also do not know the cost of the tablets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">76.    For the controlled drugs I was arrested with,
                            Mamin will plant the drugs. My job is to bring the drugs into Singapore
                            and sell them in Singapore. Mamin will tell me who to pass and sell the
                            heroin to in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77.    Mamin, upon successfully crossing of the causeway,
                            will tell me the names of 2 persons I am suppose to deliver the drugs
                            to. I do not know who these 2 persons are.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78.    I have brought in drugs a few times. The previous
                            occasions were not big deliveries. After I brought the drugs into
                            Singapore, Rocky will distribute the cannabis. Amran [an ex-worker of
                            the Appellant]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>
                            will distribute the heroin for me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79.    Rocky and Bala assist me to distribute the drugs.
                            The(y) also help me bring the drugs across. That is all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As mentioned earlier, the Trial Judge was
                    satisfied, after hearing the <em>voir </em><em>dires</em> conducted in respect of P97 and P132, that there
                    was no inducement, threat or promise made by the IO when the information
                    recorded in these two statements was obtained from the Appellant. In our
                    analysis, however, there are serious doubts about the correctness of the Trial
                    Judge’s finding for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Firstly, P97 and P132 clearly disclose a
                    confession as defined in s 17(2) of the Evidence Act. These
                    self-inculpatory statements of the Appellant were obtained by the IO several
                    months after the Appellant was arrested on 28 April 2007. The timing of
                    these statements invites keen scrutiny, given that the Appellant had
                    unequivocally and consistently denied his guilt right from the date of his
                    arrest. Even more unsettling was the fact that P97 and P132 were obtained at a
                    time when the CNB’s initial investigations in relation to the
                    Appellant’s arrest on 28 April 2007 appeared to have been concluded,
                    as evinced by the fact that the Appellant had already been transferred from the
                    CNB’s premises to Queenstown Remand Prison for some time by then. In this
                    regard, the following exchange between this court and the Prosecution in the
                    course of the hearing of the appeal is highly pertinent:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Secondly, the Prosecution’s explanation
                    that the IO visited the Appellant on 20 August 2007 with the intention only
                    of serving the Appellant with the ecstasy charge (which related to the same
                    incident leading to the Appellant’s arrest on 28 April 2007) is not
                    entirely satisfactory, given that the Prosecution has accepted that other
                    non-cannabis charges similarly stemming from the circumstances leading to the
                    Appellant’s arrest were served on the Appellant prior to his transfer to
                    Queenstown Remand Prison, <em>ie</em>, while the
                    CNB’s investigations were still actively ongoing. It is also significant
                    to note that the particulars of the ecstasy charge were, at the time that charge
                    was served on the Appellant, still crafted in a fairly tentative and ambulatory
                    manner, notwithstanding that many months had already elapsed since the
                    Appellant’s arrest. To recap, the ecstasy charge reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This leaves a real likelihood that the service of the ecstasy charge
                    so late in time could well have been a pretext by which the IO was trying to
                    gain access to the Appellant at Queenstown Remand Prison without the knowledge
                    of the Appellant’s counsel. Why was the IO even attempting to serve a
                    further non-capital charge on the Appellant at such a late stage? Ordinarily,
                    when an accused faces a capital charge, the Prosecution will not proceed with
                    lesser charges at the trial. This is a common-sense practice in view of the
                    irreversible nature of a conviction on a capital charge. So why did the IO visit
                    the Appellant at Queenstown Remand Prison on 20 August 2007? No
                    satisfactory reason was offered by the Prosecution as to why the ecstasy charge
                    was being preferred so late in the day and why it was necessary to do so. As we
                    have just mentioned, it appears to us that the service of the ecstasy charge
                    might not have been the true underlying reason for the IO’s visit to the
                    Appellant on 20 August 2007. If the IO had indeed not been candid in his
                    evidence on this issue, there ought to be grave concerns about the credibility
                    of his (and the Interpreter’s) version of the events which allegedly
                    transpired during the meeting with the Appellant on 20 August 2007 (and
                    also during the meeting on 16 October 2007). Unfortunately, the Trial Judge
                    did not consider this issue at all in coming to his determination that the
                    contents of P132 and P97 had been voluntarily given by the Appellant (see above
                    at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Thirdly, the IO’s explanation during the
                    second <em>voir dire</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> (which concerned
                    P97) that he subsequently visited the Appellant again on 16 October 2007
                    because he needed to clarify certain matters regarding the DNA Report is also
                    questionable. The Appellant denies that there was any discussion on any DNA
                    analysis report on 16 October 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> According to the DNA
                    Report, traces of the Appellant’s DNA were found on the string of the blue
                    paper bag containing the two bundles seized by the CNB surveillance officers
                    after the arrest on 28 April 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> (see
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). This was the matter which the
                    IO apparently wanted to ask the Appellant about on 16 October 2007, as can
                    be seen from the IO’s evidence during the second <em>voir
                        dire</em> as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [In] one of the statements that I recorded from [the Appellant]
                        in the immediate weeks after the arrest[,] … [the Appellant]
                        indicated that he did not transfer anything between the two vehicles.
                        … I wanted to know why in the event that if he has not transferred
                        the drugs, would his DNA be found on the [string of the blue paper
                        bag]?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We are unable to accept the IO’s explanation. As mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, P97 was the last in a series
                    of statements made by the Appellant between 30 April 2007 and
                    16 October 2007. P97 (made on 16 October 2007) consisted of ten
                    paragraphs numbered as paras 70 to 79, while the preceding paragraphs
                    (recorded between 30 April 2007 and 8 May 2007) were numbered as
                    paras 1 to 69 and marked as “P135” to
                        “P139”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> (these preceding
                    paragraphs will hereafter be referred to as
                    “paras 1–69” for short). It can be seen from <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above that nothing in the ten paragraphs
                    constituting P97 captured any information from the Appellant relating to the
                    clarification allegedly sought by the IO. That leaves us with
                    paras 1–69 to test the veracity of the IO’s explanation above.
                    From the records we have perused, paras 1–69 were recorded by the IO
                    on five separate occasions between 30 April 2007 and 8 May 2007
                    –
                    <em>ie</em>, those paragraphs were recorded <em>before</em> the DNA Report (which was dated 1 October
                    2007) was available. This meant that the IO could not have posed any questions
                    to the Appellant on the DNA Report when paras 1–69 were recorded. It
                    follows that since there was no mention at all of the DNA Report in P97 either,
                    there is no evidence in writing of the Appellant’s clarification as
                    regards the IO’s queries on this report, if such queries had indeed been
                    posed to and answered by the Appellant. If seeking clarification from the
                    Appellant on the DNA Report was indeed the real reason for the interview on
                    16 October 2007, it is difficult to understand why the IO did not make any
                    reference whatsoever to this in writing in P97. This gap in the evidence is
                    disturbing, to say the least.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Fourthly, according to what was recorded in
                    para 78 of P97 (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above), one
                    Amran, an ex-worker of the Appellant, was allegedly involved in the drug runs
                    previously conducted by the Appellant. Paragraph 78 of P97
                        states:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have brought in drugs a few times. The previous occasions were not big
                        deliveries. After I brought the drugs into Singapore, Rocky [<em>ie</em>, Tamil] will distribute the cannabis. Amran will
                        distribute the heroin for me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In P132 too, the IO recorded in his field book that the Appellant said
                    that Amran was also involved in the circumstances leading to the
                    Appellant’s arrest on 28 April 2007 (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above). However, despite these references in P97 and P132
                    implicating Amran, we understand from counsel for the Appellant and the
                    Prosecution that neither the police nor the CNB has to date taken any legal
                    action against Amran or summoned him for questioning and/or investigation in
                    relation to the Appellant’s arrest on 28 April 2007. This, again,
                    raises other questions. That no steps have been taken to investigate the damning
                    information against Amran in spite of the glaring references to him in P97 and
                    P132 defies logic and suggests that the Appellant might not have given these two
                    statements in the bland manner recounted by the IO and the Interpreter. Why did
                    the investigators not make further inquiries about Amran (who, according to P97
                    and P132, was a drug trafficker) if those statements were indeed procured
                    voluntarily and therefore likely to be credible?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Fifthly, the Prosecution’s case has
                    always been that the contents of P97 and P132 were given by the Appellant
                    voluntarily in his attempt to persuade the IO to spare him from a capital
                    charge. That is why – so the Prosecution’s case theory goes –
                    the Appellant did not accede to the information which he offered during the
                    IO’s visit on 20 August 2007 being reduced into a signed written
                    statement despite the IO’s request for that to be done (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> In
                    our judgment, if it were indeed true that the Appellant voluntarily offered his
                    confession (as set out in P132) to the IO on 20 August 2007 in a bid to
                    bargain for a lighter sentence (to which bargain, the IO responded (so he
                    testified at the trial), “it’s not within my position to make a
                    call on this”),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> there would be no
                    conceivable reason whatsoever for the Appellant to subsequently have agreed to
                    the explicit details of his confession being reduced into writing (in the form
                    of P97) when the IO visited him again on 16 October 2007. From the
                    Appellant’s perspective, having his confession reduced into writing would
                    simply have left him without any more bargaining chips if he harboured the hope
                    of successfully striking a bargain with the authorities on a lighter
                    sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We also note that the Trial Judge found that
                    “[u]nfortunately [the Interpreter’s] evidence was unclear in parts
                    as she had not kept notes of the events and was relying on her memory”
                    (see the Judgment at [46]). We find it highly unsatisfactory that the
                    Interpreter apparently kept no notes of what transpired on both 20 August
                    2007 and 16 October 2007 at Queenstown Remand Prison. All interpreters
                    should independently keep meticulous notes of what transpires in the course of
                    their duties. This is a common-sense practice that ought to be observed by all
                    interpreters. In the present case, what can be said is that the
                    Interpreter’s evidence does not unequivocally support the IO’s
                    version of events. <em>Finally, we note that in rejecting the
                        Appellant’s assertions that he had not given P97 and P132 voluntarily,
                        the Trial Judge did not give any plausible reasons for his
                        determination</em>. He merely made the following cryptic observations
                    (which we reproduced earlier at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above)
                    after summarising the evidence: in relation to P132, he found that “there
                    was no credible evidence that [the Appellant] had made the oral statement to
                    [the IO] as a result of the alleged threat and promise” (see the Judgment
                    at [56]), and in relation to P97, he found “the evidence of [the IO] and
                    [the Interpreter] consistent and credible, but not the evidence of [the
                    Appellant]” (see the Judgment at [76]). He did not consider the issues
                    which we analysed above at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>–<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Having regard to the factors set out above, we
                    are not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that P97 and P132 were obtained
                    without any inducement, threat or promise from a person in authority. There are
                    just too many gaps in the Prosecution’s evidence on this aspect of the
                    case. Accordingly, we rule that P97 and P132 should not have been admitted in
                    evidence against the Appellant at the trial below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We should also mention, for the sake of
                    completeness, that it came to our attention from our perusal of the record of
                    proceedings (in particular, the notes of evidence of the <em>voir
                        dire</em> conducted in respect of P97) that there was a series of
                    e-mail communications between the Appellant’s wife and the IO between
                    October 2007 and April 2008. Among those e-mails, there was one particular
                    e-mail which the IO acknowledged having sight of, <em>viz</em>, the e-mail in which the Appellant’s wife alleged that
                    the IO had “made a promise to [the Appellant]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> None of the aforesaid e-mails were
                    considered by either the Appellant’s counsel or the Trial Judge to be
                    relevant to the Appellant’s claim of inducement, threat or promise in the
                    making of P97 and P132. In our view, this is another serious defect in this
                    case. The aforesaid e-mails could have been helpful in either rebutting or
                    substantiating the Appellant’s allegations of inducement, threat or
                    promise in the making of P97 and P132. In view of this serious defect, added to
                    the troubling concerns that we highlighted at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above, we
                    find that it would be unsafe to admit in evidence P97 and P132 against the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence without P97 and P132</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     With P97 and P132 excluded, the question now
                    turns to whether the Appellant’s conviction can still stand on the basis
                    of the evidence that remains on record. In this regard, for the reasons stated
                    at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>–<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> below, the statutory presumptions of possession and
                    knowledge under the MDA (2001 Ed) which the Trial Judge applied against the
                    Appellant (referred to hereafter as “the statutory presumptions of
                    possession and knowledge” for short) cannot be invoked to fill up the
                    gaps in the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above), the Trial Judge was of the view that
                    there was “an abundance of evidence against [the Appellant] … in
                    the way of direct evidence and presumptions” (see the Judgment at [126]).
                    The “direct evidence” was, in the Trial Judge’s view,
                    “the [CNB] surveillance officers’ evidence that [the Appellant]
                    took the blue paper bag to his car and his admission [in P97] that his job was
                    to sell the drugs in Singapore” (see the Judgment at [126]). Putting
                    aside the statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge for the moment and
                    having regard to our decision to exclude P97 and P132 from the evidence, we do
                    not accept that the CNB surveillance officers’ testimonies (as set out at
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) <em>alone</em> could have secured the Appellant’s conviction in the
                    court below. In our analysis, the CNB surveillance officers’ evidence is
                    by no means “direct evidence” of such a degree of conclusiveness
                    as to establish the Appellant’s guilt on the criminal standard of proof,
                    that is, beyond reasonable doubt. Suffice it for us to state that the CNB
                    surveillance officers’ evidence only goes so far as to show that the
                    Appellant, with the help of Tamil and Bala, transferred the bundles containing
                    the drugs from the rear bumper of SCQ 143 X to the boot of
                    SGT 809 X; nothing in this evidence goes further to show or indicate
                    the existence of the requisite <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> on the Appellant’s part for the alleged crime
                    of drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In our view, the contemporaneous statements
                    P86A and P86B (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above), which were
                    considered by the Trial Judge in the Judgment at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> and <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> respectively,
                    are not sufficient either to support the Appellant’s conviction. P86A
                        reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We find that the evidence contained in P86A
                    and P86B, far from being sufficient to support the Appellant’s conviction,
                    is inconclusive in establishing the ingredients of the
                    crime allegedly committed by the Appellant. Indeed, as can be seen from the
                    above extracts from those two statements, the Appellant adamantly maintained
                    that he did not know that the two bundles recovered from the blue paper bag in
                    the boot of SGT 809 X contained drugs. We should add that another gap
                    in the Prosecution’s evidence here is the absence of the relevant
                    handphone records of the Appellant, Tamil and Bala. These records might have
                    shed some light on the communications between them prior to their arrest and,
                    hence, their actual knowledge, if any, of the contents of the aforesaid paper
                    bag. Unfortunately, these records, although addressed in the submissions made at
                    the trial, were not produced in evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above, the Prosecution raised the alternative argument that
                    in any event, the Appellant would still fail to discharge his burden of proof in
                    rebutting the statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We do not think that these statutory
                    presumptions can be applied against the Appellant in view of our ruling that P97
                    and P132 are inadmissible. The reason is that without the evidence contained in
                    P97 and P132, the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant is now no
                    different from that against Tamil and, in particular, Bala, both of whom were
                    acquitted by the Trial Judge with no appeals by the Prosecution therefrom.
                    Admittedly, the Appellant was, in the words of s 21 of the MDA
                    (2001 Ed), “in charge of” SGT 809 X –
                    <em>viz</em>, the vehicle in which the cannabis was found
                    when the Appellant, Tamil and Bala were arrested – at the material time.
                    However, this was fortuitous in that the evidence at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>–<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above shows
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     the cannabis was initially in
                        SCQ 143 X, which was <em>not</em> under the
                        charge of the Appellant at the material time (as mentioned at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above, Tamil borrowed SCQ 143 X
                        from Sundrammurthy upon reaching the Yishun car park on the morning of
                        28 April 2007);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     the cannabis was then moved to SGT 809 X;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     shortly
                        thereafter, the Appellant, Tamil and Bala were arrested by the CNB
                        surveillance officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If the three men had been arrested
                        <em>before</em> the cannabis was moved to
                    SGT 809 X, the presumption of possession under s 21 of the MDA
                    (2001 Ed) could have been invoked only against Tamil (as the cannabis would
                    then have been found in SCQ 143 X, which Tamil had borrowed from
                    Sundrammurthy), but not against the Appellant. Given these circumstances, we do
                    not think it justifiable to apply that presumption against the Appellant merely
                    because it so happened that the CNB surveillance officers arrested him (along
                    with Tamil and Bala) only after the cannabis had been moved to
                    SGT 809 X. It follows that since the Appellant has neither been proved
                    nor presumed to have had the cannabis in his possession at the material time,
                    the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA (2001 Ed) cannot
                    be invoked against him. In our view (and with respect), the Trial Judge failed
                    to adequately consider the above facts in assessing whether, in the first place,
                    the statutory presumptions of possession and knowledge could be applied in the
                    present case. He merely proceeded on the basis that these presumptions were
                    applicable and summarily concluded that they had not been rebutted by the
                    Appellant (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). No factual
                    examination was done (apart from making the bald statement that “the
                    cannabis was recovered from SGT 809 X and … [the Appellant] was
                    in possession and control of the car” (see [121] of the Judgment)) and no
                    reasons were given. In these circumstances, we are unable to endorse the
                    conviction of the Appellant for the capital offence charged against
                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In this regard, we would also draw attention
                    to the reason given by the Trial Judge for acquitting Bala. At [145]–[148]
                    of the Judgment, it was stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">145    … [T]here is evidence which I accept that
                            Bala had taken the bundles of cannabis from the bumper and placed them
                            in the blue paper bag … and had possession of them during that
                            short period of time. This brings on the presumption in s 18(1),
                            and the question whether the presumption was rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">146    There was no evidence that he had actual knowledge
                            that the bundles contained drugs, or cannabis in particular. Was there
                            wilful blindness and equated knowledge? One can say that he should have
                            suspected that there were illicit contents in the bundles, but can it be
                            said that he should have suspected that the contents were drugs or
                            cannabis? Did he have the opportunity to allay his suspicions? <em>The events from the retrieval of the bundles in [the] bag
                                to the arrest took place too quickly for him to make enquiries or to
                                examine the bundles.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">147    
              <em>A finding of wilful blindness
                                is portentous in that a person with no actual knowledge is equated
                                with having knowledge. Such a finding should be made only when it is
                                clear that the person had intentionally and deliberately maintained
                                his ignorance, in circumstances when a reasonable person would have
                                suspicions and would have made enquires or take other steps to allay
                                his suspicions. There must be suspicion and intention; carelessness
                                or thoughtlessness will not suffice. Against this backdrop, I do not
                                find wilful blindness against Bala because it cannot be said that he
                                had suspected that the bundles contained cannabis and had
                                deliberately suppressed his suspicions</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">148    The prosecution has not shown that Bala had actual
                            or equated knowledge that there was cannabis in the bundles, or that he
                            was in possession of the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking, and
                            therefore he is also not guilty of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Given that the Trial Judge found that there
                    was insufficient basis for him to apply the statutory presumptions of possession
                    and knowledge against Bala, the Appellant should not be in any worse position
                    than Bala – absent the evidence in P97 and P132 – merely because the
                    Appellant, Tamil and Bala were arrested only after the cannabis had been moved
                    from SCQ 143 X to SGT 809 X. We <em>might</em> have been more prepared to apply the relevant statutory
                    presumptions against the Appellant had the cannabis been placed directly in
                    SGT 809 X from the outset, but that was not the case here. Further,
                    just as Bala had possession of the cannabis for only a “short period of
                    time” (see the Judgment at [145]), the position was the same <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Appellant as he (along with Tamil and
                    Bala) was arrested shortly after the cannabis was moved to SGT 809 X.
                    It can thus equally be said of the Appellant that, just as in Bala’s case,
                    “[t]he events from the retrieval of the bundles in [the] bag [<em>ie</em>, the blue paper bag recovered from the boot of
                    SGT 809 X (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above)] to the
                    arrest took place too quickly for him to make enquiries or to examine the
                    bundles” (see the Judgment at [146]). In the circumstances, we see no
                    reason why the law should find against the Appellant when Tamil and Bala were
                    acquitted by the Trial Judge. Whatever its reasons might be, the Prosecution has
                    not appealed against Tamil’s and Bala’s acquittals. We are thus
                    placed in the difficult position of having to treat those acquittals as correct
                    in law, and to assess the Appellant’s culpability on precisely the same
                    evidential scales as those employed by the Trial Judge to acquit Tamil and Bala.
                    After careful consideration, we cannot say that the evidence on record reveals
                    that the Appellant is any more culpable than Tamil and Bala (who were both
                    acquitted), especially given that traces of cannabis were found in Bala’s
                    urine whereas no trace was found in the Appellant’s urine. We also note
                    that unlike the Appellant, Tamil has an antecedent. Having said that, we are, as
                    just mentioned, constrained by the Prosecution’s stance (in not pursuing
                    appeals in respect of the Trial Judge’s decision to acquit Tamil and Bala)
                    to deem Tamil’s and Bala’s acquittals correct in law, and,
                    accordingly, we shall make no further comment in that regard. We would only
                    mention that the evidence suggests that as between the Appellant, Tamil and
                    Bala, one or more (or possibly all) of them knew that the blue paper bag
                    recovered from the boot of SGT 809 X contained cannabis or, at the
                    very least, some form of controlled drug. However, the evidence against
                        <em>the Appellant specifically</em> is flawed, and we
                    find it unsafe, based on such evidence, to convict him of the capital charge
                    brought against him.</p>
