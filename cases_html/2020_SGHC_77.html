</div> but was refused registration on the basis that the new society’s name was too similar to the existing registration of the Club. A group of the University’s alumni, with the full authorisation of the HAA, proceeded to register the Singapore branch of the new official Harvard Club under the name “HARVARD UNIVERSITY ASSOCIATION OF ALUMNI IN SINGAPORE” on 7 December 2015. I will refer to the new club as “HUAAS”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision of the PAR </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In his GD, the PAR dealt with a larger list of issues (both procedural and substantive) than is relevant for the purposes of this judgment. I will thus summarise his decisions only on the relevant grounds, namely the substantive grounds of opposition laid out at [13] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The PAR’s findings in relation to s 8(7)(a) of the TMA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The PAR dismissed the opposition under s 8(7)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the TMA as he found that the goodwill generated by the Club in connection with its use of  the Application Marks belongs to the University by virtue of an implied licence. In this regard, the Club was a “mere licensee” of the University, thereby allowing it to use the University’s trade marks including, <span class="font-italic">inter alia, </span>“HARVARD” and “HARVARD CLUB” (GD at [79] - [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The PAR reasoned that the default position in law is that ownership of the goodwill remains with the University unless there was an agreement otherwise (GD at [83]). As there was no agreement for the goodwill to accrue to the Club, the Club did not enjoy the goodwill connected with the Application Marks. The first element of the tort of passing off was not made out and he thus rejected the Club’s opposition under s 8(7)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the TMA (GD at [88] – [89]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 While the PAR’s remarks in relation to the tort of passing off were primarily addressed at “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE”, they should be read as pertaining also to “HARVARD UNIVERSITY CLUB OF SINGAPORE”, by virtue of the similarity in the names. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The PAR’s findings in relation to bad faith under s 7(6) of the TMA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The PAR rejected all the following three lines of argument that the Club raised as evidence of the University’s bad faith in registering the Application Marks under s 7(6) of the TMA: (1) that the Application Marks were filed by the HAA in the University’s name but without the University’s authority; (2) that there was dishonest, improper or some form of unacceptable conduct falling within the scope of bad faith; and (3) that the Applicant had filed for two trade marks at the same time without a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>intention to use them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 After reviewing the evidence, the PAR rejected the first argument “without any hesitation whatsoever” as there was no evidence of this (GD at [96]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Given his earlier finding that the University owns the goodwill attached to the Application Marks, the PAR decided that the Club’s rights to use the name “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE” were contingent on the University’s continued recognition of affiliation. The University has the right to file for the Application Marks, and it could exercise this at any time, including prior to the termination letter (GD at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The third argument was rejected on the basis that trade marks and society names are different. Even though the University would not be able to register both names as societies in the Registry of Societies, this does not mean that the University does not intend to use the Application Marks. Further, there is no rule to say that a registered trade mark proprietor must use its marks immediately (GD at [100]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The PAR’s findings in relation to s 7(5) of the TMA read with s 4(3)(c) of the Societies Act </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 This ground pertained solely to the first Application Mark, “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE”. The PAR rejected it on the basis that the Club’s case could not fulfil the two constituent elements under s 7(5) of the TMA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Section 7(5) of the TMA reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Absolute grounds for refusal of registration</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">7.</span>—(5) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that its use is prohibited in Singapore by any written law or rule of law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The PAR opined that the word “use” under s 7(5) of the TMA must be targeted at the “actual use” of a trade mark and would not cover the mere registration of a society under the Societies Act. Further, the discretion of the Registrar of Societies under s 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Societies Act to refuse to register a specified society does not amount to a prohibition under “written law or rule of law” prohibiting the use of a name or mark in Singapore under s 7(5) of the TMA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Club’s opposition thus failed on all grounds before the PAR. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues – Grounds of Opposition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The broad issues before me are whether the PAR erred in dismissing the Club’s opposition based on passing off under s 8(7)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the TMA, bad faith under s 7(6) of the TMA, and use prohibited in Singapore by written law or rule of law under s 7(5) of the TMA read with s 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Societies Act (see [13] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Within these broad issues, various sub-issues arise for consideration.

</div> This gives the impression that they are concerned not specifically with the goodwill in the Club’s business as a whole but with whether the Club had acquired goodwill in the names “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE” and “HARVARD UNIVERSITY CLUB OF SINGAPORE”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The use of such terms as part of the goodwill ownership analysis runs dangerously close to importing the concept of distinctiveness back into the goodwill inquiry. This is because distinctiveness, as part of the misrepresentation inquiry, specifically looks at whether the relevant public associates the mark, get-up or any other claimed badge of origin (<span class="font-italic">eg, </span>the Club’s name “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE”) with the goodwill (see <span class="font-italic">Singsung</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39] citing SPGA ([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [20]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This should be avoided as it is contrary to the express guidance of the CA that the distinctiveness inquiry should be dealt with solely at the misrepresentation stage (see <span class="font-italic">Singsung </span>([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [38] – [39] and <span class="font-italic">The Audience Motivation Company Asia Pte Ltd v AMC Live Group China (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 3 SLR 517 (“<span class="font-italic">AMC</span>”) at [82] - [83]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Bearing this caution in mind, I now consider the issue of goodwill.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) My decision on goodwill </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In a large majority of cases, it is unnecessary to undertake a separate inquiry on goodwill ownership once goodwill has been found to exist on the facts. This is because the entity whose business as a whole generates the goodwill will often be the undisputed owner. The question of ownership arises when there are rival claims to goodwill, for example as between a licensor and a licensee or a manufacturer and its distributor (see Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Ng-Loy Wee Loon”</span>) at paras 17.6.1 to 17.6.3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the present case, parties are in agreement that the Club’s activities and services have generated goodwill. The dispute centres around who owns it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I agree with the University that the Club has no goodwill with which to sustain an opposition based on the tort of passing off. In arriving at my decision, I am aided by the PAR’s meticulous and detailed analysis of the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Taking each of the University’s arguments in turn, my reasons will be structured as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether an implied licence exists on the facts of this case. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, whether the presence of an implied licence <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>means that the ownership of the goodwill vests in the licensor. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, who owns the relevant goodwill on the facts?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Whether an implied licence exists as between the Club and the University</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I agree with the PAR that the Club and the University were in a trade mark licensor-licensee relationship in relation to the Harvard Marks including “HARVARD” and “HARVARD CLUB”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Unlike most other commercial arrangements, the present case is unique in that there was no formal signed trade mark licence agreement.

</div> The University thus resorted to the implied licence argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 By way of background, a trade mark licence is often said to be the grant of permission by the proprietor for the use of the trade mark by a third party. It is often, but not necessarily, in the form of an agreement that is subject to the laws of contract. In other words, it is the licence that prevents the third party (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the licensee) from infringing on the trade mark or being liable in passing off while the contract (if any) spells out how parties are to carry out the agreement (see Neil J Wilkof &amp; Daniel Burkitt, <span class="font-italic">Trade Mark Licensing </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2005) (“<span class="font-italic">Wilkof &amp; Burkitt”</span><span class="font-italic">-</span>) at paras 1-10 and 10-02). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 An implied licence is an unwritten licence often thought to arise from the conduct and actions of parties (<span class="font-italic">Wilkof &amp; Burkitt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 11-02). In the UK, implied licences have been found to exist even in cases of unregistered marks (see <span class="font-italic">eg, Harrods Ltd v Harrods (Buenos Aires) Ltd </span>[1999] F.S.R 187).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It is important to note that strictly speaking, an unregistered trade mark is not in itself a species of property. What is licensed is the right to use the mark in a manner which the tort of passing off would otherwise prevent (Christopher Wadlow, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Passing Off: Unfair Competition by Misrepresentation </span>(5th Ed) (“<span class="font-italic">Wadlow</span>”) at para 7-93). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Some of the University’s Harvard Marks <span class="font-italic">eg, </span>“HARVARD”, were only registered in Singapore starting from 1991, more than 20 years after the Club’s registration as a society in 1969.

Mr Paisner reported that the leadership of the clubs “is uniformly good” and that they hold frequent club meetings. He also said that “[t]he Singapore Club also appears to have good material waiting to take over”. It is quite unlikely that Mr Paisner would praise the Club if it had been wilfully flouting the University’s rules and policies.

Amongst other things, the survey was designed to test their presidents’ understanding of HAA guidelines and procedures. As astutely observed by the PAR, the Club stated correctly that the presidential term limit is three years when such information is not found in the Club’s constitution and bylaws but is present in the Guidelines and Handbook.

The clearest example of this occurred when a Harvard alumnus, Mr Oscar Tan, created a Facebook group and LinkedIn page that made use of some of the Harvard Marks without being authorised by the University (for detailed facts see [69] – [72] of the GD). For present purposes, it suffices for me to say that when the Club realised that an interloper was attracting members away from it, its response was to swiftly call upon the University to enforce its rights in the Harvard Marks against Oscar Tan and not to enforce any trade mark rights on its own behalf.

This implied licence arose when the Associated Harvard Alumni wrote to the Club’s founders to acknowledge the Club’s existence on 29 May 1969.

This is because, in formulating the said test, V K Rajah JA expressly cited and approved the US case of <span class="font-italic">Villanova University v Villanova Alumni Educational Foundation, Inc </span>123 F Supp 2d 293 (E.D. PA. 2000) (“<span class="font-italic">Villanova”</span>), a case involving similar facts. There, a group of alumni sought Villanova University’s permission to use its trade mark to form a club that conducted fundraising activities in support of the university’s sports programs. The alumni group was given verbal permission to do so by the president of the university in 1972. This was followed by a formal affiliation agreement only much later in 1992 and finally a revised agreement in 1995. The court however found, based on the objective conduct of the parties, that the university exercised a sufficient degree of control over the club’s operations such that an implied licence existed between 1972 and 1992, which encompassed the club’s use of the university’s trade mark. This was because the club generally followed the guidelines imposed on it by the university. The university would also take steps to update the guidelines and enforce them (albeit with a gentle hand) in the event of violations. The court also found that the 1992 and 1995 affiliation agreements made express the previously implied licence agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 An implied licence between the University and the Club can therefore arise out of the objective conduct of the parties for the use of the Harvard Marks even where the parties had not entered into a written and signed licence agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(II) <span class="font-italic">If so, what kind of implied licence is this? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The above paragraphs make it clear that the implied licence was in relation to the use of the Harvard Marks including “HARVARD” and “HARVARD CLUB”. This was by virtue of the Club’s old status as a Harvard Club. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Moreover, this licence is a limited and exclusive one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It is limited in that the licence only covered the sphere of activities and operations of a Harvard Club. It is conceivable that an authorised distributor of the University could set up shop in Singapore to sell authentic “HARVARD” sports jerseys. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 It is exclusive as the Club appears to have been the only entity in Singapore authorised to use the Harvard Marks (in particular “HARVARD CLUB”) as a Harvard Club. It acted as if this licence was to the exclusion of all others, including the University itself (see s 43(1) of the TMA). I say so for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 First, both parties agree that the Club was the first and only Harvard Club in Singapore for close to 50 years. While there are now two new societies on the Registry of Societies that incorporate Harvard Marks into their names (Harvard Business School Club of Singapore and HUAAS), the earlier one was only registered on 28 January 2015. While the Club’s implied licence was only revoked on 29 May 2015 (see above at [78]), the relevant date for the purposes of assessing a claim of passing off is the date on which the complained of conduct of the University commences (<span class="font-italic">CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 975 at [34]). In the present case, the complained of conduct would have commenced, at the latest, when the University sought to register the Application Marks on 24 December 2014.  The Club was thus the sole entity authorised to use the University’s Harvard Marks in Singapore during the relevant period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, as mentioned above, the Club took swift action to call upon the University to enforce its trade mark rights the moment it felt that its position as the sole Harvard alumni organisation in Singapore was threatened by Mr Oscar Tan in late 2011. Emails from a HAA director, Mr Peter Weldon, show that University sided with the Club and offered solutions to safeguard the Club’s position. This is notwithstanding the fact that Mr Oscar Tan is also a Harvard alumnus.

</div> The conduct of the parties is thus consistent with that of an exclusive licensor-licensee relationship. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Whether the existence of an implied licence <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>means that the licensor owns the goodwill </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I now turn to the follow up question of whether the existence of an implied exclusive licence <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>means that the licensor owns all the relevant goodwill. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As mentioned above at [17], the PAR answered this question in the affirmative at [83] of the GD: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law on ownership of goodwill in licensor-licensee situations <span class="font-italic">appears to be well settled</span>.

I reproduce the former passage as it is more relevant to the present licensing fact scenario: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[3-150]  If the commercial purpose of an agreement is to license the use of a distinctive name or mark in respect of which the licensor has (or is agreed to have) goodwill, to a licensee with no such goodwill, and in circumstances where the licensee’s use would otherwise be actionable as passing-off, then in the <span class="font-italic">absence of agreement to the contrary or other supervening factors</span>, the goodwill in the business so carried on by the licensee under the licensed name or mark will accrue to the licensor rather than the licensee. The licence may be express or implied…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The cited paragraph alludes to the fact-based nature of the ownership inquiry as it includes a consideration of “other supervening factors” alongside the agreement or contract. In my view, in a case where there is no express contract or agreement as to the ownership of the goodwill, it is especially important that one does not end the enquiry by employing a “default position” analysis. Rather, one must have regard to the full factual matrix of a case to determine ownership in an implied licence situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In this regard, I agree with Lai Siu Chiu J in <span class="font-italic">QB Net Co Ltd v Earnson Management (S) Pte Ltd and others </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">QB Net</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35] that “it would be unwise to rigidly adhere to the general rule that a licensee does not acquire goodwill in respect of the licensor’s business. Instead, regard must be had to the evidence adduced by the parties on the facts.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In <span class="font-italic">QB Net, </span>Lai J observed in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that goodwill could be jointly owned by the foreign licensor and domestic licensee even though there were two licence agreements between them which gave the licensee the right to operate 10-minute hair cut salons under the under the trade names “QB House” and “QB Shell” and to adopt the QB house system, get up and house marks. Her Honour found that the licensee had contributed significantly to publicity efforts in Singapore and substantially modified the licensor’s instructions manuals to make them suitable for use here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Having reviewed the facts of this case, I have no difficulty in concluding that ownership of the goodwill resides in the University for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 First, the success and continued operation of the Club would not be possible without the help and support of the University.

At that time, there was only a single officer in the Club, Mr Joseph Zuber, who became uncontactable.

</div>  In support of this, it cites the English case of <span class="font-italic">Harrods</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([39(b)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic">. </span>There, the famed department store, Harrods of Knightsbridge, failed in its action of passing off against a private school called “The Harrodian School” as the business with which Harrods was associated with did not include schools. I agree with the PAR (GD at [85]) that <span class="font-italic">Harrods </span>can be distinguished on the facts as it involved two parties in wholly disparate fields of commercial activities whereas the present case involves a school and its alumni club. The fields of activity are both rooted in education and deal with the same select group of individuals. The University is thus entitled to claim the Application Marks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 To conclude this section on goodwill, I reject the Club’s arguments and find that the relevant goodwill belongs solely to the University. In the words of the CA in <span class="font-italic">SPGA </span>([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [20], the Club has failed to establish that it has an interest that the law of passing off will protect. I thus reject the first ground of opposition under s 8(7)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the TMA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Misrepresentation </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Strictly speaking, there is no need for me to deal with the elements of misrepresentation and damage. However, as parts of the parties’ cases are built on the use of the Harvard marks and the Application Marks, I will touch briefly on the distinctiveness of the Application Marks as part of misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The test of distinctiveness is best understood as a threshold inquiry in the context of determining whether the University, in attempting to register the Application Marks and presumably using it in the future, has committed an actionable misrepresentation. Simply put, if the Application Marks (and more particularly “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE”) are not distinctive of the Club’s services and activities, the mere fact that the University wishes to use very name of the Club (or something very similar) will not amount to a misrepresentation (<span class="font-italic">Singsung </span>([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [38]). In other words, the question is whether the goodwill of the Club is sufficiently associated with the Application Marks, the registration of which is being challenged by the Club (<span class="font-italic">AMC </span>([47] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [87]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In my view, even on the assumption that the relevant goodwill belongs to the Club, the Club will still fail to prove an actionable misrepresentation as it cannot fulfil the threshold test of distinctiveness. For the avoidance of doubt, my comments here pertain also to “HARVARD UNIVERSITY CLUB OF SINGAPORE” even though the Club does not use it as its name. This is by virtue of the close similarity of the Application Marks (see [18] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 First, the goodwill generated by the Club is associated with the word “HARVARD” rather than the names of the Application Marks. The word “HARVARD” in the Application Marks is evocative of the University and designates it as its trade source and origin. This is the result of the University’s substantial investment in advertising, promoting and protecting the Harvard Marks in Singapore and around the world.

</div> I agree with the PAR that while every single term in “The Singapore Professional Golfers’ Association” is essentially descriptive, the same cannot be said for the Application Marks which include the distinctive word “HARVARD”. The analogy is thus misconceived.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In addition, the Club submits that it is possible to draw a distinction between “HARVARD” and the Application Marks. In other words, the individual words in Application Marks must be taken as a whole – “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE” and “HARVARD UNIVERSITY CLUB OF SINGAPORE” – and not broken into its constituent elements. The obvious flaw in this argument is that it is impossible to read the Application Marks without immediately focusing on the word “HARVARD”, the only distinctive element in the Application Marks. Without it, “CLUB OF SINGAPORE” and “UNIVERSITY CLUB OF SINGAPORE” would mean nothing to actual and potential Harvard alumni. It would be unable to attract new members and may also lose existing members. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Second, the overwhelming majority of Harvard Clubs worldwide are named “HARVARD CLUB OF [location]”. This is a clear suggestion that there is at least <span class="font-italic">some</span> nexus between any entity named “HARVARD CLUB OF [location]” and the University.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the University repeatedly interfered with the activities of the Club (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by asking Dr Lee to step down from her role as president and threatening to terminate the Club’s status as a Harvard Club). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the University did not enter into negotiations with the Club in good faith as it filed the two trade mark applications while negotiations were ongoing, six months before the termination letter. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the University sought to usurp the Club’s role as an alumni club in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the University deliberately chose Application Marks that are identical or very similar to the Club’s name. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I agree with the PAR’s decision to reject these arguments. The University is the sole owner of the goodwill generated by the Club in connection with the use of the Application Marks and is thus entitled to file for their registration at any point. The PAR rightly observed that the Club is a mere licensee who did not pay any licence fees to use the Harvard Marks. The permission granted to it was “contingent on the [University’s] continued recognition of affiliation and thus revocable by the University at any point” (GD at [98]). On the facts, the Club was clearly in breach of the University and HAA’s policies (<span class="font-italic">eg, </span>by failing to adhere to the 3-year presidential term limit) and the University was more than justified in terminating the affiliation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I also add that while the two Application Marks are identical and similar (respectively) to the Club’s name, this does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>mean that there is bad faith because one must still have regard to the factual circumstances of the case. As the learned author in <span class="font-italic">Tan Tee Jim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>states at para 7.170: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Bad faith does not invariably arise if all that is present is knowledge of a rival’s use of an identical or similar mark for identical or similar goods or services. <span class="font-italic">The applicant may well honestly believe that he has a superior right to registration and/or use of mark</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Furthermore, per V K Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Weir Warman </span>([59] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [49]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It appears to me to be an incontrovertible proposition that if a registrant of a trade mark has proprietorship of that trade mark, or at the very least, the <span class="font-italic">right to register</span> that trade mark, then such registration of the trade mark should fall well within the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced persons in the particular trade.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The University is the registered owner of the Harvard Marks both in Singapore and around the world. All the goodwill generated by the Club in connection with the use of the Application Marks resides in the University. I thus find that its behaviour in registering the Application Marks (even though negotiations were ongoing) falls well within the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Argument 3: No intention to use </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The Club’s final argument is that the University filed for two, almost identical marks within class 41 for club services with no intention to use them. This is because it would not be possible for the University to register both Application Marks as societies – the Registrar of Societies would block this under s 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Societies Act as the names would be too similar. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 As the PAR correctly pointed out, there is a difference between a trade mark and a society name. A registered society may be registered in one name and yet use different marks to denote its services. Furthermore, a registered trade mark proprietor does not have to put its marks into use immediately. Under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the TMA, a registered mark only becomes liable to be revoked on the basis of non-use for five years after the completion of registration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The University also makes it clear that it fully intends to use those marks. It previously attempted to register a society under the name “HARVARD UNIVERSITY CLUB OF SINGAPORE” and even provided an official authorisation letter to the Registry of Societies.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Club’s Submissions at paras 37, 38.2 – 38.6</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Registrar of Societies has a discretion to refuse to register a society if its name falls into the Deceptive Resemblance or Identical Name grounds. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Registrar of Societies has already refused the University’s application to register a society on the basis that its name “HARVARD UNIVERSITY CLUB OF SINGAPORE” was caught by the Deceptive Resemblance ground. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Assuming that the University remains true to its word and indeed takes steps to use the name “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE”, the University would likely use one of the Application Marks as the name of a new Harvard Club.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the attempt is indeed made, the Registrar would refuse to register the new society on the basis of the Identical Name ground because the Club is already registered under the same name and is a separate legal entity. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Registrar’s decision would amount to a prohibition against the use of “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE” under “any written law or rule of law” within s 7(5) of the TMA such that the registration of the same name as a trade mark must be refused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 As this appears to be the first case that directly addresses the interplay between s 4(3) of the Societies Act and s 7(5) of the TMA and one of the rare local cases dealing with s 7(5) of the TMA, it is necessary for me to have regard to first principles in analysing the Club’s argument. In my view, the Club’s argument is wrong in principle and must be rejected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Dealing first with the requirement of prohibition according to “written law or rule of law”, I agree with the PAR that s 7(5) of the TMA is not meant to cover the present situation. I say this for a few reasons.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Despite the lack of judicial authority, the meaning of the term “written law” is clear; it refers to an express prohibition in statute. Per <span class="font-italic">Ng-Loy Wee Loon </span>at para 21.5.3: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The real targets of s 7(5) are trade marks the use of which is prohibited by, for example, other legislation such as the Singapore Tourism Board Act (on the use of the Merlion symbol) and the Geneva Conventions Act (on the use of the symbol associated with the Red Cross). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">A similar view was also taken in <span class="font-italic">Tan Tee Jim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 7.148. Plainly, the decision of the Registrar of Societies to disallow registration cannot count as a “written law”. To read it otherwise would mean that a mere registered society name has the same status as <span class="font-italic">eg, </span>the Merlion symbol, which is expressly protected against misuse on pain of criminal sanction under s 24 of the Singapore Tourism Board Act (Cap 305B, 1997 Rev Ed). This clearly cannot be the position at law. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Unfortunately, the same clarity does not exist in respect of the expression “rule of law” (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Tee Jim </span>at para 7.148) which appears to be wider in scope than “written law”. Nonetheless, it is clear to me that s 7(5) of the TMA was not meant to be read with s 4(3)(c) of the Societies Act. The wording of ss 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) and 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the Act makes it clear that Parliament intended for the Registrar’s power to be discretionary. This is because s 4(3) of the Act uses the word “may” while the preceding subsections ss 4(1) and 4(2) of the Act employ the mandatory word “shall”. This means that it is within the Registrar’s statute-given powers to register a society even if it falls afoul of the Deceptive Resemblance or Identical Name grounds. A discretion, which by its very definition, may or may not be exercised, cannot fall within the definition of “rule of law”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Even taking the Club’s argument at its highest and assuming that the Registrar’s discretion to refuse registration amounts to prohibition by “rule of law”, I agree with the PAR that the Club cannot succeed under s 7(5) of the TMA because the word “use” relates to “actual use” in the trade mark sense and does not cover the mere registration of a society for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sections 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) and 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the Societies Act do not provide the Registrar of Societies with authority over the use of any trade mark but merely a limited authority over the registration of society names. The Registrar cannot grant or prohibit the use of trade marks even if it is identical to the name of a registered society. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The “actual use” approach is in line with <span class="font-italic">Scotch Whisky Association v Isetan Mitsukoshi </span>[2019] SGHC 200 (<span class="font-italic">“Scotch Whisky Association”)</span>, the latest local pronouncement on s 7(5) of the TMA. There, the “written law or rule of law” refers to ss 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Geographical Indications Act (Cap 117B, 1999 Rev Ed) (“GIA”). In order for s 7(5) of the TMA to come into play, there had to be “use of a geographical indication” under the abovementioned sections of the GIA. The court thus had to decide what “use” in the context of GIA meant. It held that the “plain and ordinary meaning of the word ‘use’” should be employed and not the wider forms of “use” such as “indirect commercial use” and “evocation”. While the High Court’s decision appears to be primarily concerned with the word “use” as found in the abovementioned sections of the GIA (as opposed to “use” under s 7(5) of the TMA), I agree with the PAR’s observation that the relevant provisions of the GIA all deal with instances of actual use. The dicta in <span class="font-italic">Scotch Whisky Association </span>in relation to “use” can thus be extended by analogy to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 For completeness, I add one further observation as to why the Club’s opposition on this ground must fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 It would be against public policy to permit a registration in the Register of Societies to block a trade mark application in the trade marks register. The Societies Act and the TMA govern distinct regimes that deal with wholly disparate subject matters. The latter governs the trade mark regime in Singapore while the former </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… plays a gate-keeping role in ensuring that groups which may be used for unlawful purposes or pose a threat to public order, welfare or good order in Singapore, or which will be contrary to our national interests are not allowed to establish themselves in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(19 May 2005) vol 77 Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The logical corollary to allowing the opposition based on the Club’s argument is that trade mark rights (which count as legal property) can effectively be subordinated to the registration of a society name which does not create legal rights. This would have far reaching practical consequences. For one, a trade mark owner might be precluded from using its own Singapore registered trade mark if an entity manages to register a society under an identical or similar name. This is plainly unjust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Such a result would also be at odds with practical realities because the Registrar of Trade Marks does not conduct prior mark searches on the societies register before registering a trade mark. The same can be said about the Registrar of Societies; under s 4 of the Societies Act, the Registrar does not have to consider the laws and principles of trade marks when registering a society (or when refusing to do so).  Thus, it would be against public policy to allow an opposition under s 7(5) of the TMA on the basis of the Identical Name ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 To conclude, I find that the Club cannot rely on s 7(5) of the TMA read with s 4(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Societies Act to mount an opposition against the application of the first Application Mark, “HARVARD CLUB OF SINGAPORE”. The last ground of opposition is accordingly rejected. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 For the reasons set out above, I find that none of the grounds of opposition are made out. I dismiss the appeal and affirm the PAR’s decision to allow the registration of the Application Marks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I will hear parties on costs if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wun Rizwi (RHTLaw Asia LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chew Lixian Ashley (Ella Cheong LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
