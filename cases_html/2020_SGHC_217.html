The terms of the Settlement were set out in a letter from the Collector dated 22 March 2018 (the “Settlement Letter”) that was addressed to the appealing SPs, including the plaintiff SP.

Further, there is an obligation imposed on the Defendant not to cause or allow anyone to breach the terms of the Settlement Letter.”

Section 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(vii) BMSMA covers notices or awards for any non-lot acquisition, and “non-lot acquisition” is defined in s 2(1) BMSMA to mean “any acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act (Cap. 152) of any common property (and no other land) comprised in a strata title plan”. The phrase “application made to it in writing in respect of a lot which is the subject of the subdivided building concerned” in s 47(1) BMSMA does not mean that s 47(1) BMSMA has nothing to do with common property; it simply means, in relation to those who apply under s 47(1) BMSMA as SPs of lots in a building, that they must be SPs of lots in <span class="font-italic">that</span> building, and not <span class="font-italic">another </span>building.

To the contrary, s 29(3) BMSMA, which concerns situations involving limited common property, uses the phrase “perform the duties and exercise the powers referred to in subsections (1) and (2)”. What an MC does pursuant to s 29(2) BMSMA is described in s 29(3) BMSMA as its “powers” and “duties”, in the same breath as what it does pursuant to s 29(1) BMSMA; furthermore, s 29(1) BMSMA encompasses not only powers and duties arising from the BMSMA itself but also what may arise from a resolution (ss 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) and 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) BMSMA as discussed at [31]–[33] above). There is no good reason to limit s 47(1) BMSMA to powers and duties arising out of the BMSMA itself, to the exclusion of powers and duties arising out of by-laws, resolutions, or agreements under the BMSMA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 47(1) BMSMA is not limited to documents relating to the MC’s regulation and management of the strata development</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The MC argued that s 47(1) BMSMA is limited to documents obtained in the course of the MC’s regulation and management of the strata development, and not anything undertaken <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> such as representing SPs in seeking compensation for compulsory acquisition of common property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The MC specifically cited s 24(3) BMSMA, which I have referred to above (at [23] and [26]), and also s 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) BMSMA – that it shall be the duty of a management corporation, amongst other things,  “to control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation”. Sections 24(3) and 29(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) BMSMA refer to the control, management and administration of the common property, but an MC’s powers, duties and functions are more extensive than that. For instance, they include (under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(vii) BMSMA) making available notices under ss 3, 8 or 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, or any copy of an award under s 10 of the Land Acquisition Act, received by an MC for any non-lot acquisition. The MC’s argument that such documents should not fall within s 47(1) BMSMA, either because they are not “in respect of a lot”, or because they do not relate to the regulation and management of the strata development (on the basis that what has been compulsorily acquired is no longer part of the development), cannot stand in light of the express language of s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(vii) BMSMA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">The provision of the Settlement Documents to an SP that the MC represented, does not open the door to outsiders obtaining the documents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The MC argued that if the court were to find that the SP was entitled to the Settlement Documents, that would open the floodgates to other SPs (who were not appealing SPs), or even outsiders such as prospective purchasers, obtaining the Settlement Documents; that would in turn result in the MC breaching its confidentiality obligations under the Settlement Letter <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Collector.

If there is a breach after the plaintiff SP obtains the documents, the only SPs who could have been responsible for that breach are the plaintiff SP, and the SPs on the council who already have the Settlement Documents. In that event, presumably the MC would identify the plaintiff SP as the one responsible for the breach. I did not consider the MC to be justified in withholding the Settlement Documents from any of the 84 appealing SPs, but now it should certainly provide those documents to the plaintiff SP.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Withholding the Settlement Documents would deny the SP information that it ought to have</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The following example provided by counsel for the SP resonated with me. Consider the case of a lawyer who has been authorised by his client to pursue or settle a claim; the lawyer concludes a settlement and then tells the client that he will only make payment to the client (after deducting his legal fees) if the client agrees:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) that he will not know the amount of the settlement; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) that he will not know the amount of the legal fees.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 If the client agreed to those terms, he would never know if he had been paid the correct amount; nor would he know what the lawyer’s fees were (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, were they too high, or might the client at least have grounds to seek taxation of those fees?). I do not think a client in that position would be obliged to agree to those terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 This example is of course not a perfect analogy; the MC here did not provide professional services itself – it engaged lawyers and other professionals to do so. Also (and for the avoidance of doubt), I cast no aspersions on the MC here or the professionals involved: I do not know what the Settlement Sum is, what the terms are, or what the fees are. But this is precisely the point: the SP is similarly kept in the dark, and it is entitled to know.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The resolution relied upon by the MC did not allow it to withhold the Settlement Documents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I did not consider that the resolution relied upon by the MC allowed it to withhold the Settlement Documents from the plaintiff SP (or the other appealing SPs). The MC was authorised to claim compensation, conduct the appeal, and accept an offer from the Collector; but this did not allow it, when an agreement had been reached for additional compensation, to deprive the appealing SPs that it had represented in arriving at the Settlement of the Settlement Documents (without which the SPs would not really know what had happened).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The DJ reached the same conclusion (at [25]–[31], especially [29] of his oral grounds of decision). I noted that although the DJ considered the obligation of disclosure under s 47(1) BMSMA to be mandatory, the DJ also held that the facts of the case did not justify the MC withholding the documents (see the paragraphs of the DJ’s oral grounds cited above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I also noted that the MC’s chairman, Mr Parry Yeo, had in an e-mail of 30 January 2019 stated that he believed “… it is technically incorrect to withhold the figures from the sps involved in the compensation package”.

I accepted the SP’s submission that all the necessary facts were already before the court; indeed, the MC did not point to any other facts that might only later emerge, or which required a trial. The MC did argue that a factual evaluation was necessary as to whether its decision to withhold the documents was justified, and particularly whether it could consider the interests of the MC (or of all the SPs), or of all the appealing SPs, in withholding the Settlement Documents from the plaintiff SP. I made that evaluation in reaching my conclusion that s 47(1) BMSMA applied, and that the MC was not justified on the alleged grounds of confidentiality to withhold the Settlement Documents from the plaintiff SP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The MC also argued that I had no jurisdiction or power to uphold the DJ’s decision on an alternative ground, namely, agency. The MC accepted that if this were an appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal could uphold a decision on grounds other than those relied upon by the judge at first instance. However, the MC argued that the position in this regard was different for appeals from the State Courts to the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Section 22 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (the “SCJA”) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Powers of rehearing</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span>—(1)  All appeals to the High Court in the exercise of its appellate civil jurisdiction shall be by way of rehearing.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The High Court shall have the like powers and jurisdiction on the hearing of such appeals as the Court of Appeal has on the hearing of appeals from the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Section 22(2) SCJA is not subject to any restriction like that contended for by the MC. Indeed, such a restriction would not make sense: it would mean that the High Court would be obliged to overturn a decision if the grounds relied upon by the first instance court did not justify the decision, even though the High Court regarded the decision as a correct one that could be justified on other grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The MC also contended that, in any event, I should not deal with the agency issue because the DJ had only granted leave to appeal in relation to the s 47(1) BMSMA issue; as for the agency issue, the DJ had decided that against the SP, and the SP had neither appealed nor sought leave to appeal on that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I did not think it was open to the SP to appeal against the DJ’s order in so far as the order was in the SP’s favour: an appeal lies against the order made, not against the reasons given – see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</span>, vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th ed, 2020) at para 57/1/7. The issue of the SP seeking leave to appeal on the agency issue thus did not arise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(51,51,51,1) ">81 </span>Having found for the SP on both the issues of s 47(1) BMSMA and agency, I dismissed the MC’s appeal with costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Hewage Ushan Saminda Premaratne and Yvonne Mak Hui-Lin (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chen Chongguang Daniel and Loh Kah Yunn</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Lee &amp; Lee) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
