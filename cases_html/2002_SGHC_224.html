<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1

        This is an appeal by the Defendants against the

decision of District Judge Tan Peck Cheng of 5 November 2001 upholding the order of the

Deputy Registrar giving interlocutory judgment against the Defendants with costs. I upheld

the decision of the District Judge on 4 April 2002. The Defendants have, with leave,

appealed to the Court of Appeal on 13 September 2002 and I now give the grounds for my

decision.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The brief facts of the matter are as follows.

The Defendants, a law firm, had acted for the Third Party, Mohamed Arif

("Arif"), who is the Plaintiff’s husband, in Suit No. 321 of 1989 and Suit

No. 758 of 1991. Arif did not pay their professional fees in full and the Defendants took

up D.C. Suit No. 489 of 1994 to recover the balance. Arif did not defend the action and

default judgment was entered. When Arif did not satisfy the judgment sum of $33,922.80 the

Defendants took out a Writ of Seizure and Sale on 11 April 1994.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        Execution of the writ was levied on certain

property at Bhadhar Point, a kiosk at the Toa Payoh Bus Interchange selling a variety of

goods such as newspapers, periodicals, soft drinks, sweets and tit-bits, cigarettes and

other minor items. The Plaintiff, who claimed the goods seized belonged to her, through

her solicitors gave notice to the Defendants to release those goods. The Defendants

refused and the Plaintiff took out interpleader proceedings, at the end of which the

Defendants were ordered to release the goods to the Plaintiff. The Defendants’ appeal

against that order was heard by District Judge Khoo Oon Soo who dismissed it with costs on

22 August 1994.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        The Plaintiff then filed the present action to

claim for damages in respect of, <i>inter alia</i>, losses she had incurred as a result of

the seizure of the goods. On the Plaintiff’s application, the Deputy Registrar

entered interlocutory judgment against the Defendants in respect of the claim for damages.

District Judge Tan Peck Cheng dismissed the Defendants’ appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        In the present proceedings the Defendants

alleged that the order made in the interpleader proceedings to release the goods to the

Plaintiff was procured by fraud on the part of the Plaintiff and her husband, Arif.

Therefore there is a triable issue and interlocutory judgment ought not to be given. I

should add that this is not pleaded in the Defence filed by the Defendants in this action.

It is only alleged in the affidavits filed by the Defendants in opposition to the

application for summary judgment. Be that as it may, I shall assume that the

Defendants’ allegation is <i>bona fide</i> and that they would have been permitted to

take that position on affidavit in opposing summary judgment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        The allegation of fraud is as follows. In the

course of giving instructions to the Defendants when they were acting for him, Arif had

confirmed that Bhadhar Point belonged to him. The Defendant showed how it was previously

known as Arif Jamal Kiosk. The Plaintiff had produced a deed of assignment dated 20

September 1991 which showed that Arif had assigned the business, along with the kiosk, to

her. This transfer was effected some three years before the seizure. Since that time the

business had been registered in the Plaintiff's name in the Registry of Businesses.

However the Defendants gave a number of reasons why this was a sham. I do not propose to

set these out as they are not relevant for my present purposes. Suffice it to say that it

necessarily involves the Plaintiff and Arif committing perjury in the hearing of the

interpleader summons.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        The main problem with the Defendants’ case

is that they ought to have raised the question of fraud at the hearing on the interpleader

summons. O 17 r 5, which sets out the powers of the Court in such a hearing, states as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5. —(1)    

    Where on the hearing of a summons under this Order all the persons by whom adverse claims

    to the subject-matter in dispute (referred to in this Order as the claimants) appear, the

    Court may order —</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)    that any

    claimant be made a defendant in any action pending with respect to the subject-matter in

    dispute in substitution for or in addition to the applicant for relief under this Order;

    or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b)    that an

    issue between the claimants be stated and tried and may direct which of the claimants is

    to be plaintiff and which defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2)    Where

    —</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)    the

    applicant on a summons under this Order is the Sheriff;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b)    all the

    claimants consent or any of them so requests; or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c)    the

    question at issue between the claimants is a question of law and the facts are not in

    dispute,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">the Court may summarily determine

    the question at issue between the claimants and make an order accordingly on such terms as

    may be just. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3)    Where a

    claimant, having been duly served with a summons for relief under this Order, does not

    appear on the hearing of the summons or, having appeared, fails or refuses to comply with

    an order made in the proceedings, the Court may make an order declaring the claimant, and

    all persons claiming under him, for ever barred from prosecuting his claim against the

    applicant for such relief and all persons claiming under him, but such an order shall not

    affect the rights of the claimants as between themselves.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        If the allegation of fraud had been made at

that stage, the Court would ordinarily have ordered the matter to determined in a trial

pursuant to r 5(1)(b). The purpose of the interpleader procedure is to make a finding of

the rights of the parties in respect of any goods in the possession of a third party.

Those are the proceedings in which the Defendants ought to have raised the issue of fraud

of which they had knowledge at the time. Counsel for the Defendants alleged before me that

this issue was indeed raised before the District Judge at the hearing of the interpleader

summons. He made certain allegations as to the directions of the judge which I do not need

to go into for the reason that it was open to the Defendants to appeal against his

decision if they were not satisfied with it. They did not and there is an issue estoppel

against the Defendants in respect of the ownership of the goods in the present

proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        The Defendants submit that, because the order

in the interpleader summons was procured by the fraud of the Plaintiff and Arif, it may be

reopened. They rely on s 46 of the Evidence Act which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46.    Any party

    to a suit or other proceeding may show that any judgment, order or decree which is

    relevant under section 42, 43 or 44, and which has been proved by the adverse party, was

    delivered by a court not competent to deliver it or was obtained by fraud or collusion.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Defendants say that because

the order made under the interpleader summons was procured by fraud, it is relevant and

may be proved in the present proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        First of all, I should state that I am

extremely surprised at the proposition that a party can avoid issue estoppel or <i>res

judicata</i> by alleging that an order obtained in a court in Singapore was procured by

fraud where he was aware of the fraud but did not raise it in the earlier action, or if he

did, did not appeal against it. If that were correct, then no judgment would be final in

that a party can raise fraud in a subsequent action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        I do not think that s 46 is as wide as the

Defendants contend. Unfortunately counsel for both parties have not been able to unearth

any authority in Singapore or in Malaysia that could assist in its interpretation. However

there is a commentary in <i>Sarkar’s Law of Evidence</i>, 13<sup>th</sup> Ed that is

helpful. I do not propose to discuss that in any detail, save to say that the editors

opine that the fraud contemplated in this provision must be an extrinsic act unconnected

with the matter adjudicated upon, e.g. fraud by which a litigant is prevented from

appearing and placing his case before the court at trial. They are of the view that it

does not apply to an allegation that a party had committed perjury in the earlier action.

The editors cite the following passage from the judgment of Petheram CJ in <i>Md Gulab v

Md Sulliman</i> 21 C 612 @ p 619:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The principle upon which these

    decisions rest is that where a decree has been obtained by a fraud practised upon the

    other side, by which he was prevented from placing his case before the tribunal, which was

    called upon to adjudicate upon it in the way most to his advantage, the decree is not

    binding upon him, and may be set aside …, but I am not aware that it has ever been

    suggested in any decided case; and in my opinion it is not the law that because a person

    against whom a decree had been passed alleges that it was wrong and that it was obtained

    by perjury committed by, or at the instance of, the other party, which is of course fraud

    of the worst kind, that he can obtain a re-hearing of the questions in dispute in a fresh

    action by merely changing the form in which he places it before the Court, and alleging in

    his plaint that the first decree was obtained by the perjury of the person in whose favour

    it was given. To so hold would be to allow defeated litigants to avoid the operation not

    only of the law which regulates appeals, but of that which relates to <i>res judicata</i>

    as well.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I respectfully agree with this

reasoning and on that basis, I held that the Defendants could not rely on s 46 of the

Evidence Act to raise the allegation of fraud in the present case in order to avoid being

estopped from asserting that the goods in question do not belong to the Plaintiff.</font></p>
