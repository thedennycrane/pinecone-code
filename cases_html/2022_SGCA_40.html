Under the statutory scheme, appeals from decisions of the General Division of the High Court are to be made to the Appellate Division, unless they come within the Sixth Schedule to the SCJA (see ss 29C(1)-(2) of the SCJA). The present application, Originating Summons No 5 of 2022 (“OS 5”), presents us with an opportunity to provide guidance on how counsel should navigate this statutory scheme and how the categories in the Sixth Schedule ought to be interpreted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 OS 5 is an application by Mr Seow Fook Sen Aloysius (“Mr Seow”) for leave to appeal against the decision of a judge in the General Division (“the Judge”) in <span class="font-italic">Seow</span><span class="font-italic"> Fook Sen Aloysius v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP</span> HC/OS 1185/2021 (8 February 2022) (“OS 1185”). OS 1185 was an application by Mr Seow for an order for taxation of a bill of costs under s 120 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The background to OS 1185 was as follows. Sometime in April 2020, Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP (“R&amp;T”) was engaged by Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd (“HLT”) to carry out some corporate restructuring work. R&amp;T required HLT to provide funds of S$2m as a deposit for the engagement. HLT duly provided a cheque for the deposit. At the request of his wife (a director of HLT), Mr Seow also provided a cheque to R&amp;T. The parties had intended for Mr Seow’s cheque to be deposited in place of HLT’s own cheque if the latter could not be cleared. In the event, HLT’s own cheque did not clear and Mr Seow’s cheque was deposited into HLT’s client account with R&amp;T. R&amp;T then proceeded to carry out the restructuring work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In November 2020, R&amp;T issued an invoice to HLT (which by then had come under the care of judicial managers) for the sum of S$908,955.68 in respect of HLT’s restructuring work done between 8 April 2020 and 27 April 2020. R&amp;T then informed HLT’s judicial managers that it proposed to set off those fees against the sum of S$2m in HLT’s client account (representing the funds from Mr Seow’s cheque) and return the balance to Mr Seow. It does not appear that HLT’s judicial managers objected to the same. R&amp;T then proceeded to debit S$908,955.68 from HLT’s client account and returned the balance to Mr Seow. Mr Seow was however dissatisfied with the quantum of the fees that had been debited and so he sought an order under s 120 of the LPA for R&amp;T’s bill of costs to HLT to be taxed. HLT has since been wound up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 A preliminary issue stands in the way of this court considering the leave application proper. Sections 29C(1) and (2) of the SCJA provide that an appeal against a decision of the General Division in the exercise of its original or appellate civil jurisdiction is to be made to the Appellate Division and <span class="font-italic">not </span>to the Court of Appeal, unless provided for by the Sixth Schedule to the SCJA or any other written law. Mr Seow considers the Court of Appeal as the appellate court to which an appeal from the Judge’s decision is to be made, and accordingly with which OS 5 should be filed, on the basis that his intended appeal comes within para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Sixth Schedule, which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. For the purposes of section 29C(2), an appeal against a decision of the General Division in the exercise of its original or appellate civil jurisdiction is to be made to the Court of Appeal in the following cases: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)  the appeal arises from a case relating to the insolvency, restructuring or dissolution of a corporation … (even if the appeal does not raise any issue relating to the law concerning the insolvency, restructuring or dissolution of a corporation …); </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 It appears that Mr Seow has taken this position for two reasons. First, it is because R&amp;T’s engagement (which gave rise to the disputed bill for which Mr Seow seeks an order for taxation) had arisen in the <span class="font-italic">factual</span> context of HLT’s judicial management and subsequent winding-up. Second, he found it significant that the words in parentheses in para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Sixth Schedule provide for an appeal which did not <span class="font-italic">itself </span>raise any issue relating to the law of insolvency as nevertheless coming within the scope of para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). Presumably, Mr Seow thought that buttressed the first reason because it meant that it did not matter that his intended appeal <span class="font-italic">itself </span>raised no issue relating to HLT’s insolvency and the legal principles or rules which it engaged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Sixth Schedule to the SCJA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 To determine if Mr Seow’s position is justified, we need to consider the proper scope of the Sixth Schedule to the SCJA. The appeals which the Sixth Schedule provides are to be made to the Court of Appeal by default can be classified into three categories: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, where the appeal “arises from a case relating to” specified subject matter, such as constitutional or administrative law, contempt of court, the law of arbitration, insolvency or the law of patents. This is provided for in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Sixth Schedule. Importantly, as the words in parentheses in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) make clear, even if the appeal <span class="font-italic">itself </span>does not raise issues relating to specified subject matter, so long as it “arises from a case relating to” that subject matter, it will nevertheless come within the Sixth Schedule. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, where the appeal is against particular decisions of the General Division, such as a decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) (see para 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)), a decision made under the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 (see para 1(<span class="font-italic">g</span>)), a judgment or order made in an action brought under s 47(8) of the Presidential Elections Act 1991 (see para 1(<span class="font-italic">h</span>)), or a decision made under the Mediation Act 2017 or the Singapore Convention on Mediation Act 2020 (see paras 1(<span class="font-italic">k</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">l</span>)). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, where the appeal is to be made to the Court of Appeal under written laws (see paras 1(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">j</span>)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The establishment of the Appellate Division and the statutory scheme for the allocation of appeals in the SCJA was meant to relieve the Court of Appeal’s growing caseload from a quantitative perspective, while simultaneously permitting it to focus its resources on matters which would benefit from its expertise as the apex court of the land from a qualitative perspective (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Noor </span><span class="font-italic">Azlin bte Abdul Rahman and another v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 2 SLR 440<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [5]). At the second reading of the SCJA(A), the Senior Minister of State for Law, Mr Edwin Tong, explained the general considerations which underlie the identification of appeals that came within the Sixth Schedule (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(5 November 2019) vol 94 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)). The Minister explained that these appeals are generally those that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) are likely to have substantial consequences for individuals or society; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  may involve questions of law of public interest which would benefit from guidance of the apex court in Singapore; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  concern the general administration of justice; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) may involve novel questions of law, or new areas of law which would benefit from guidance from the Court of Appeal; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) may involve issues that are likely to be important and require earlier clarification from the Court of Appeal; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f)  relate to strategic areas that would benefit from the stature of the apex court, such as the areas of laws which seek to bolster Singapore’s status as a dispute resolution hub or debt restructuring hub. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Returning to the Sixth Schedule itself, it may be observed that the criteria relating to the second and third category of appeals are relatively more straightforward in that they involve a purely factual<span class="font-italic"> </span>inquiry. For instance, whether the decision appealed from is a decision of the SICC or whether any written law provides for the appeal to be made to the Court of Appeal, are questions which permit of only a yes or no answer that can be given immediately by reference to the facts relating to the subject appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Turning to the criteria relating to the first category of appeals, namely, whether an appeal “arises from a case relating to” subject matter specified in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Sixth Schedule, it can obviously be read as involving a purely factual inquiry. In that case, a <span class="font-italic">factual</span> relationship between a case and any of the specified subject matters, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">however tangential</span>, would suffice. This appears to be the interpretation adopted by Mr Seow, as he considers the fact that HLT’s insolvency featured in the factual background of OS 1185 sufficed to render it “a case relating to” insolvency and bring his intended appeal within para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 That analysis cannot be correct. Let us explain. By specifying that appeals which “[arise] from a case relating to” particular subject matter in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) are to be made to the Court of Appeal, notwithstanding that the Appellate Division is to be the final appellate court for the vast majority of civil appeals (see s 29C(1) of the SCJA), Parliament has recognised the subject matter specified in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) as that which will either involve <span class="font-italic">issues</span> of importance and so will require and benefit from consideration by the Court of Appeal, or which represent <span class="font-italic">areas of law </span>that concern questions of public interest or which serve other strategic purposes so that the appeal benefits from the guidance or the stature of the apex court (see [8] above). In other words, for an appeal to come within paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), there must be something in the appeal which makes it necessary for the apex court of the land to hear it. In this regard, it must also be borne in mind that although decisions of the Appellate Division are binding on the General Division, unlike the Court of Appeal, the Appellate Division does not have the powers to <span class="font-italic">overturn</span> or <span class="font-italic">overrule</span> its previous decisions or depart from decisions of the Court of Appeal, although it can <span class="font-italic">depart </span>from the Appellate Division’s own precedents (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">UJM v UJL </span>[2021] SGCA 117<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [115]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 What is clear is that Parliament could not have intended for the criteria in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) to be satisfied so long as the specified subject matter features somewhat by way of factual background to the “case”, even if this is by way of the most tenuous or tangential manner (it follows, of course, that the said criteria would clearly not be satisfied if the specified subject matter does not even feature in the factual background to the “case” itself). In our view, there must be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">something more</span>. Otherwise, the criteria in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) would have an exceedingly low threshold that can be satisfied in almost every instance, and which may, as a result, no longer operate to draw a distinction between those appeals which necessarily must be heard by the Court of Appeal and those which fall outside of that category. Unlike the other subparagraphs within the Sixth Schedule, the criteria in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) cannot be read as involving a purely factual inquiry because doing so would undermine the role of paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) in carving out specific categories or types of proceedings to be heard by the Court of Appeal (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Wei </span><span class="font-italic">Fengpin v Raymond Low Tuck Loong and others </span>[2021] SGCA 115<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32] <span class="font-italic">and</span> the statutory scheme for the allocation of appeals in the SCJA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 With these considerations in mind, we consider that “a case relating to” a specified subject matter in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is one where the latter is legally relevant to and/or has some bearing on<span class="font-italic"> </span>the reliefs or orders which were sought at first instance. In hearing an appeal from a decision by the court of first instance to either grant or deny the reliefs or orders sought (as the case may be), an appellate court will very likely have to consider issues relating to the specified subject matter which, by their nature, are deemed by Parliament to be of importance and so will require and benefit from consideration by the apex court of the land (see [11] above). That in turn renders it necessary for the appeal to be heard by the Court of Appeal. Put simply, at the very<span class="font-italic"> least</span>, some reasonable relationship must be established between the specified subject matter and the “case” from which the appeal arises, whether with regard to the <span class="font-italic">legal issues </span>therein or the <span class="font-italic">application</span> of the law to its facts, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the court below</span>,<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>so that either or both of which may arise for consideration <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the appeal</span>. For example, in the context of para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), with which we are presently concerned, the “case” from which the appeal arises must concern a fact situation which involved <span class="font-italic">the rules and principles relating to the law of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">insolvency</span>, so that in the appeal, the Court of Appeal is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">also</span> either called upon to <span class="font-italic">decide a principle or rule</span> relating to the law of insolvency (thereafter applying it to the facts concerned), or at the very least, <span class="font-italic">apply</span> an established principle or rule relating to the law of insolvency to the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 We recognise that there can be situations in which the appeal, notwithstanding having arisen from a “case” bearing the requisite relation to a specified subject matter, turns on issues entirely unrelated to the specified subject matter. In the context of para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Sixth Schedule, an example will be an appeal involving the question of whether a winding-up order should be set aside on grounds entirely unrelated to the law of insolvency, such as non-disclosure of material facts or abuse of process. Notwithstanding that, the appeal will ultimately still entail the appellate court <span class="font-italic">applying</span> the established principles or rules of winding-up to the facts in determining if the winding-up order sought at first instance had been correctly made. Hence, in these situations, despite the complexion of the precise issues arising in the appeal, the appellate court will still be required to <span class="font-italic">apply to the facts</span> established principles or rules relating to the specified subject matter, in the same way that the court below had to when it granted or denied (as the case may be) the reliefs or orders sought in the “case” at first instance. Put simply, issues of importance will nonetheless arise in the appeal, and it is not any less necessary for such an appeal to be heard by the apex court of the land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 However, as the Minister explained during the second reading of the SCJA(A), appeals have also been prescribed as coming within the Sixth Schedule by virtue of their relationship to particular areas of law so that the appeal benefits from the guidance or stature of the apex court because of the importance associated with these areas of law, namely, because they are likely to involve questions of public interest, or because they relate to strategic purposes (see [11] above). Indeed, this finds expression in the specified subject matter identified in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>): matters of constitutional and administrative law or the law of contempt necessarily raise questions of public interest, while arbitration and insolvency law are crucial to bolstering Singapore’s status as a dispute resolution or debt restructuring hub. In our view, this backdrop provides the explanation for the words in parentheses in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), which provide that an appeal arising from “a case relating to” specified subject matter will nevertheless fall within the ambit of the relevant paragraph “even if the appeal does not raise any issue relating to [the specified subject matter]”. It is only consistent with the importance associated with these areas of law identified by the specified subject matter in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) for any appeal satisfying the criteria therein to be made to the Court of Appeal by <span class="font-italic">default</span>, irrespective of the issues raised in the appeal. By the words in parentheses, Parliament meant to clarify that the satisfaction of the criteria in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Sixth Schedule should not be contingent on the identity of the issues raised in the appeal. This ensures that the parties will be certain from the time when a notice of appeal is to be filed as to the court in which the appeal would lie, and that this determination does not turn on a matter as fortuitous as the identity of the specific issues that will be contested in the appeal. Such an interpretation is also consistent with the overall purpose of paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) in identifying a <span class="font-italic">distinct</span> category of proceedings to be heard by the Court of Appeal (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Wei </span><span class="font-italic">Fengpin </span>at [32]). That having been said, it would probably be an extremely rare case where the appeal does not raise any issue relating to the specified subject matter in paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) if the proceedings in the court below did indeed engage the specified subject matter in the manner that we have referred to earlier (see [13] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Finally, it should also be emphasised that the words in parentheses do not broaden the scope of paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>). The effect of those words is to make it clear that the <span class="font-italic">only </span>criteria determinative of whether an appeal comes within paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is whether it arises from “a case relating to” specified subject matter, and <span class="font-italic">not</span> the identity of the issues raised in the appeal itself (see [15] above). If, in the first place (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the court of first instance), the fact situation in the “case” does <span class="font-italic">not </span>involve (in the manner set out at [13] above) any application of the rules and principles relating to the specified subject matter at all, then the “case” does not relate to specified subject matter in the manner envisioned by paras 1(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), and the criteria therein necessarily cannot be satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Accordingly, for Mr Seow’s intended appeal to come within para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Sixth Schedule, it must be shown that the insolvency, restructuring or dissolution of HLT (being the “corporation” for the purposes of para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)) is relevant to or has some bearing on the reliefs or orders which were sought in OS 1185. Quite clearly, that must be answered in the negative. Although the insolvency of HLT provides the factual background to R&amp;T’s engagement and was also the context in which Mr Seow provided his personal cheque (from which R&amp;T’s fees for HLT’s restructuring were debited), HLT’s insolvency had no bearing whatsoever on the reliefs sought by Mr Seow in OS 1185. As the parties’ arguments and the Judge’s brief grounds of decision in OS 1185 suggest, whether an order for taxation under s 120 of the LPA was to be granted in that case turned solely on matters which exist as between Mr Seow and R&amp;T, namely, whether he had agreed with R&amp;T to undertake liability for HLT’s fees to the extent of S$2m. The fact of HLT’s insolvency and the principles and rules of the law of insolvency which it potentially engaged had <span class="font-italic">no</span> bearing on what <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Seow sought</span> <span class="font-italic">as against R&amp;T</span>. No reasonable relationship can be established between OS 1185 on the one hand and the rules and principles relating to the law of insolvency or their application to the facts on the other. The “case” from which Mr Seow’s intended appeal arises is therefore not one “relating to the insolvency, restructuring or dissolution of a corporation” and that necessarily leads us to conclude that his intended appeal does not come within para 1(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Sixth Schedule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In the circumstances, Mr Seow’s intended appeal ought to have been made to the Appellate Division and so OS 5 ought also to have been filed with the Appellate Division, and not the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal in respect of an appeal which is to be made to the Appellate Division under the SCJA. The Appellate Division has exclusive jurisdiction over that appeal, including the questions of whether leave to appeal ought to be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss OS 5 on the basis that this court has no jurisdiction to consider Mr Seow’s leave application, which ought to have been filed with the Appellate Division. In the circumstances, we also make no order as to costs. Given the relative infancy of the statutory scheme for the allocation of appeals under the SCJA and the consequential relative absence of guidance from the courts on the circumstances in which an appeal can come within the Sixth Schedule, we accept that it is understandable that Mr Seow filed OS 5 in the Court of Appeal, and for R&amp;T not to<span class="font-italic"> </span>have opposed the application on jurisdictional grounds. Thus, notwithstanding the dismissal of OS 5, we also grant Mr Seow leave to file the necessary papers with the Appellate Division within two weeks of the date of this judgment, if he wishes to pursue his intended appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 However, we emphasise that, given the guidance which we have set out in this judgment, moving forward, counsel should scrutinise any leave to appeal applications which they seek to bring and carefully consider whether it is to be made to the Court of Appeal or the Appellate Division. If an application is pursued to the Court of Appeal in spite of it unambiguously and unarguably failing to come within any of the categories in the Sixth Schedule, the application will be visited with adverse cost consequences unless the applicant is otherwise justified in doing so. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Judith Prakash<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Christopher Anand s/o Daniel, Harjean Kaur, Yeo Yi Ling Eileen, Keith Valentine Lee Jia Jin and Shalini Rajasegar <br/>(Advocatus Law LLP) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liew Wey-Ren Colin (Colin Liew LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"> </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
