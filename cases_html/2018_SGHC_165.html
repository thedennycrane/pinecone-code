The Vessel was built by the second defendant (“UWM”). The second plaintiff (“TBM”) subsequently acquired TBS’s 60% interest in the Vessel. The plaintiffs claimed that Woon breached his JV duties and that UWM assisted Woon in his breach, and claimed that there is no seaworthy Vessel despite TBS having expended more than US$5 million in the JV. They also claimed that the third defendant (“Thia”) had breached his duties as TBS’s director in failing to safeguard TBS’s interest in the JV.

Thia and Low sold their shares in TBS around 21 October 2009 and resigned as directors around 6 November 2009, and Yu continues to be the majority shareholder of TBS. Yang Feng (“Yang”) was appointed and remains a director from 1 November 2010. TBM was incorporated on 1 October 2009 with Yu, Thia and Low as its directors and shareholders.  It was formed to transfer the value of the Vessel over to it when Yu bought over Thia and Low’s shares in TBS as the share buy-out did not include the value of the Vessel.

</div> The Vessel would be constructed at Woon’s shipyard in Batam and TBS would procure the bank loan to fund the construction costs. The construction costs would be shared between TBS and Woon on a 60-40 basis and would be made through TBS; Woon would pay his 40% contribution to TBS and TBS would pay for the Vessel construction costs. Any profit or loss would be shared between TBS and Woon on a 60-40 basis. Finally, the construction would take about two years, at an estimated cost of US$5 million. As Yu did not know Woon, he asked Thia if Woon was trustworthy, and Thia vouched for Woon’s trustworthiness. Hence, Yu agreed for TBS to enter the JV.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In July 2007, Yu, Thia and Low visited Woon’s shipyard in Batam (“the Batam trip”) and Woon informed Yu that the Vessel would be constructed at his shipyard. The JV between TBS and Woon was then proceeded with on the terms that Thia had conveyed to Yu (see [5] above), and Yu left Thia to liaise with Woon. Low (for TBS) and Woon (for UWM) subsequently signed a Shipbuilding Contract dated 9 November 2007 for UWM (the builder) to build the Vessel for TBS (the owner). On 7 December 2007, TBS obtained a term loan facility from DBS Bank (“DBS”) of US$4 million for the Vessel construction (“the Loan Facility”). As Yu was based overseas, he left the daily operations and financial matters to Thia, who was assisted by Alan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Around mid-2009, Yu became increasingly concerned about the completion of the Vessel and he sent Yang to Singapore to find out the status of the Vessel construction. In early 2010, Yu discovered from Yang that Thia and Woon were directors and shareholders of UWM. Yu also discovered that the Vessel was not constructed at Woon’s shipyard at PT TKBI (“TKBI”), but at a shipyard at PT CFB (“CFB”), and that the Vessel was moved to TKBI in late 2009. Yu’s testimony in this regard is confirmed by Yang.

TBS claimed that Woon had breached his duties under the JV to be responsible for construction of the Vessel and had breached his duties as a fiduciary: (a) to properly account to TBS for all costs incurred in the Vessel construction; (b) to exercise due care and skill in the construction and in management and control of the construction costs; (c) to keep clear and separate accounts for the Vessel construction costs and not to commingle this account with accounts of other vessels built by Woon or UWM; (d) by placing himself in a position of conflict; and (e) to act honestly and in good faith. By interposing UWM as a vehicle for the funds flow for payments made for the Vessel construction, Woon, through UWM, derived benefits without TBS’s consent. Hence, UWM was liable for such benefits it received pursuant to Woon’s breach of duties. Further and alternatively, UWM acted dishonestly in assisting Woon in his breach of duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 TBS’s claimed against Thia for breach of fiduciary duties as TBS’s director. Thia had represented to Yu that Woon was trustworthy and had failed to inform TBS’s board of directors that Woon had breached his duties and did not safeguard TBS’s interest. Yang was called as a witness for the plaintiffs, and I will refer to his evidence, where relevant, in my findings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">First defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Woon’s evidence is as follows. Around May to July 2007, Thia approached Woon to partner TBS to build the Vessel for sale. Throughout the negotiations of the JV terms, Woon communicated only with Thia, who represented TBS. Under the JV, TBS was responsible for all finance and accounting matters, and procurement for the Vessel construction. However, the construction cost was never agreed on and the Shipbuilding Contract was prepared for the purposes of obtaining financing for the Vessel. It was also agreed that the Vessel would be constructed at CFB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Also in 2007, Woon suggested to Thia that they incorporate a company (UWM) to construct and sell vessels

Woon’s 40% stake in the JV was contributed by Comfort Shipping Pte Ltd (“Comfort Shipping”) and Sea Glory Shipping Pte Ltd (“Sea Glory”) in equal shares.

Alan assisted Thia with the daily decisions relating to administrative matters, procurement, finance and approval of payments for UWM. Thia and Alan also managed the accounts and finances of TBS. Ivan claimed that Thia delayed the procurement of various items for the Vessel after it was launched in December 2009, and from late 2009, Thia abandoned his responsibilities in TBS and UWM. UWM then continued to engage TKBI and Lian Yi to complete the Vessel.  However, as TBS failed to pay UWM for the construction costs from 30 October 2009, this contributed to the delay in the Vessel completion. As for Simon, he was never a director or employee of UWM, but he assisted Woon in UWM and in relation to the Vessel construction and accounts from June 2011.

</div> and which reflected the price as US$5m, the Vessel Design Contract had been prepared. Mr Kwek also submits that Thia’s claim that Woon had informed him of the cost of about US$5m could not be believed, because the estimate was subsequently proven to be wrong as the amount was closer to Woon’s US$7.5m or US$8m. This misses the point. The issue is whether the JV parties had agreed on a price. If so, that the actual cost was subsequently higher did not change the original agreement.

</div> Indeed, I find that Yu was given the impression that the Vessel would be, and was all along being, constructed at TKBI, when Woon, Thia and Andrew knew that was not the case. First, Andrew’s company, ALC Consulting Services Pte Ltd (“ALC Consulting”), had issued two reports on 6 March and 22 August 2008 respectively for TBS’s purpose of drawing on the Loan Facility. The reports stated that ALC Consulting had carried out an inspection of the Vessel at <span class="font-italic">TKBI</span>. Andrew was very evasive when asked which shipyard he visited to inspect the Vessel to prepare the reports. He reluctantly admitted that it was CFB and that he had <span class="font-italic">deliberately</span> inserted “TKBI” into the reports.

Apart from Woon’s assertion, it was not Thia’s evidence that this was a JV term. UWM’s case is that it had agreed to construct the Vessel for TBS for consideration. It is undisputed that, under the JV, the entire construction costs would be funded first by TBS, by advancing 100% of the funds (mainly by the Loan Facility) to the builder for it to utilise for the Vessel construction including paying for equipment and parts. Hence, UWM, the builder and seller of the Vessel, was responsible for procurement. There was no reason for TBS to agree to be responsible as such when it would disburse all the moneys to UWM to pay for supplies and equipment. Indeed, UWM eventually did so for most items, and reimbursed TBS for items that TBS had assisted in ordering.

Further, the inclining test report was submitted to ABS in February 2013, long after the Vessel should have been completed, and in any event, ABS’s approval was obtained not long after, in July 2013.

The subjective element lies in the court’s consideration as to whether the fiduciary had exercised his discretion <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in what he considered to be in the interests of the principal. The court would be slow to interfere with commercial decisions made honestly but which, on hindsight, were financially detrimental to the principal (at [35]). The objective element relates to the court’s supervision over fiduciaries who claim to have been genuinely acting to promote the principal’s interests even though the acts done were not in the principal’s interest. In such a case, the subjective belief of the fiduciaries cannot determine the issue – the court has to assess whether an intelligent and honest man in the position of the fiduciary could, in the whole of the existing circumstances have reasonably believed that the transactions are for the benefit of the principal (at [36]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 As some of the plaintiffs’ allegations relate to a “failure to disclose”, I should add that there is no standalone positive duty of disclosure; instead, this forms part of the fundamental duty to act in what the fiduciary considers in good faith to be in the best interests of the principal: <span class="font-italic">GHLM Trading Limited v Anil Kumar Maroo and others </span>[2012] EWHC 61 (Ch) at [192].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Putting aside first the duty to act honestly and in good faith, and not to put one in a position of conflict or possible conflict, I find that Woon was the JV partner who owed the duties mentioned at [92(a)] to [92(c)]. I reiterate my earlier findings. Under the JV, TBS would advance 100% of the Vessel construction costs to UWM (of which Woon would subsequently reimburse TBS 40%) and based on Clause 2.2 of the Shipbuilding Contract. As the appointed builder, UWM was responsible for procurement, as well as finance and accounts relating to the Vessel’s construction. Woon, as UWM’s managing director, was the key decision maker. Hence, within the structure of the JV, it was Woon who was responsible for and exercised control over these matters. Indeed, Woon admitted that he was responsible for supervising the Vessel construction, such construction being done by UWM. UWM was Woon’s vehicle under the JV for the Vessel construction and Woon was thus the JV party who had to account for the costs and expenses incurred in the Vessel construction, keep proper accounts, as well as manage and control the construction costs. Woon, as the person supervising the Vessel construction, also owed the duty to exercise due care and skill in this respect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 However, Woon claimed that he did not know how TBS’s moneys were used, he did not care about the Vessel construction costs or managing such costs, and he did not know how the construction expenses were allocated amongst the four 80-metre barges and five 25-metre tugboats (“the nine vessels”) and the Vessel that UWM constructed.

</div> In other words, Woon had completely disregarded his duty to manage and control the Vessel construction costs and to properly account for the costs incurred. Woon and Simon were unaware that UWM retained a net surplus after expenses for the Vessel construction were deducted from the JV parties’ contributions (see [79] above) until this fact was revealed at trial.

He had placed himself in a position where his personal interests conflicted with his duties as a JV partner and had breached his duty to act honestly and in good faith for the best interest of the JV. That UWM was constructing more than one vessel or Woon was supervising the construction of numerous vessels simultaneously did not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> amount to a breach of Woon’s duties under the JV. However, Woon went beyond that. He used the moneys from TBS (including the DBS loan) to finance the construction of other vessels for the benefit of himself and his related companies. Through UWM, he constructed the nine vessels in preference to the Vessel and in so doing, UWM utilised TBS’s moneys meant for the Vessel construction to fund the construction of those vessels. This led to a shortage of funds for and delay in the Vessel construction and completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 To elaborate, I find that Woon had at the outset intended to finance the construction of the nine vessels at CFB with the moneys advanced by TBS for the Vessel. In 2007, the vessel-building market was booming and Woon wanted to make money by building vessels for himself or his companies and then sell them at a good price.

</div> UWM decided to complete the nine vessels before the Vessel. Unlike the nine vessels constructed by UWM which had no written contracts, UWM and TBS entered into the Shipbuilding Contract whereby TBS would pay UWM periodically based on milestones of the Vessel construction. In fact, by April 2009, TBS had advanced about US$4.5m (more than 80% of the Vessel construction cost) to UWM and paid Cummins directly another US$1m.  As for the nine vessels, UWM was only paid a deposit and it would receive full payment only after the vessels were completed and sold.

</div> Woon and UWM could not show any independent evidence of how the construction costs for the nine vessels would be funded, and I find that this came from TBS’s moneys to UWM. It is not disputed that TBS’s moneys advanced to UWM for the Vessel were commingled with UWM’s funds and used to conduct its operations, fund its business and construct other vessels. This is supported by both Leow (UWM’s expert) and Yin (TBS’s expert).

For instance, Woon wanted the barges, which could be completed within two to three months, to be completed quickly as the market was booming; these barges were built for sale to Lian Yi (Woon’s company) and Lian Yi would “flip” them.

But despite the ongoing construction of the Vessel at CFB after the nine vessels were completed, UWM’s directors chose to close down CFB and remove all the assets and equipment. Woon even informed Lie (on 2 November 2009) that the assets should be divided equally among UWM’s shareholders; and when the equipment and assets at CFB were sold off in February 2010 for $1.6m, each of UWM’s shareholders received $400,000.

</div> Although the $1.6m were sale proceeds from the sale of UWM’s assets, the sum was not returned to UWM to continue funding its operations (namely to complete the Vessel) but distributed to its shareholders. And despite Woon’s claim that the Vessel was 85% to 90% completed when it was launched in December 2009 and that he only required 10 months to outfit the Vessel, the Vessel was not completed until January 2015. All the reasons given by Woon for the delay were, as I had earlier found, without merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The real cause of the delay in the Vessel completion was the result of Woon preferring his own interest (either directly or indirectly through entities in which he had a share) over the interest of the JV. He had intended to complete the nine vessels at the expense of the Vessel and used the moneys obtained from TBS for the Vessel to construct the nine vessels. This led to a shortage of funds for and delay in the Vessel construction and completion. By the time the nine vessels were completed and sold, TBS had already disbursed more than US$5.6m (including payments to Cummins) but the Vessel was far from complete. When the Vessel was finally completed in January 2015, the market had declined considerably. As a result, the commercial purpose of the JV had been completely undermined.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiffs’ claim against UWM</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 TBS claimed that UWM had dishonestly assisted Woon in his breach of duties. For dishonest assistance, four elements must be made out: (a) the existence of a trust or fiduciary duty; (b) the breach of it; (c) assistance rendered in respect of that breach; and (d) a finding that the assistance rendered is dishonest (see <span class="font-italic">George Raymond Zage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 589 at [20] and [22]). Assistance rendered is dishonest when the assistor has knowledge of the irregular circumstances that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them. Moreover, where a defendant (against whom a claim for dishonest assistance was made) was the controlling director or mind of the company, his knowledge can also be imputed on the company (see <span class="font-italic">Von Roll Asia Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Goh Boon Gay and others</span> [2017] SGHC 82 (“<span class="font-italic">Von Roll</span>”) at [109]; and <span class="font-italic">Beyonics Technology Ltd and another v Goh Chan Peng and others</span> [2016] SGHC 120 (“<span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”) at [159]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Having found that Woon has breached the fiduciary duties under the JV, I find that dishonest assistance on UWM is made out. UWM was used as Woon’s vehicle to carry out his breaches of duties (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the receipt of moneys from TBS which were then used for the construction of the nine vessels in preference to the Vessel), and the assistance rendered was dishonest. Being the controlling mind and will of UWM, Woon’s knowledge can be imputed on UWM, and UWM is therefore imputed with the knowledge of the terms of the JV and that the moneys advanced by TBS for the Vessel was used to finance the construction of the nine vessels in preference to the Vessel. This is knowledge out of the pale that is “dishonest”.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiffs’ claim against Thia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Even if Yu or TBS knew that Thia was a director and shareholder of UWM, Thia nevertheless owed fiduciary duties to TBS as its director until he resigned on 6 November 2009.

In <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing </span><span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2013] 3 SLR 631 (“<span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management</span>”), Vinodh Coomaraswamy JC (as he then was) set out a number of key principles: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Equitable compensation, like common law damages, is assessed by reference to the amount of money necessary to restore the victim of a breach of fiduciary duty to the position the victim would have been in if not for the breach (at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The deterrent function of equitable compensation means that the common law rules of causation, foreseeability and remoteness do not readily apply to equitable wrongdoers (at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) None of the common law limiting principles, including mitigation and comparative fault, ought to apply in a claim to recover equitable compensation as equity “deems by a fiction that it is decreeing performance of a primary obligation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defaulting fiduciary’s obligation to pay an equitable debt” (at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In the usual case, the legal burden of proving but-for causation would remain on the plaintiff throughout. The plaintiff has to show that the loss would not have occurred but for the breach, or that there was an adequate or sufficient connection between the equitable compensation claimed and the breach of fiduciary duty. This amount was to be assessed with the full benefit of hindsight and is quantified as at the date of recoupment, not as at the date of the breach of duty (at [60]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) But when a case concerns (a) a fiduciary who is in one of the well-established categories of fiduciary relationships; (b) who commits a culpable breach; (c) who breaches an obligation which stands at the very core of the fiduciary relationship, several plaintiff-friendly consequences follow. Once the plaintiff adduces <span class="font-italic">some</span> evidence to connect the breach to the loss, equity will readily shift the evidential burden on causation to the breaching fiduciary (at [56] and [61]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">Then Khek </span><span class="font-italic">Koon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other suits </span>[2014] 1 SLR 245 (“<span class="font-italic">Then Khek </span><span class="font-italic">Koon</span>”), Coomaraswamy J elaborated on his holdings in <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management</span>. He stated that an award of equitable compensation to restore the trust property to its original state or as compensation for a breach of the core fiduciary obligations of honesty and fidelity stands on a different footing from an award of equitable compensation for breach of a fiduciary’s equitable duties of skill and care (at [104]). He also noted that there is a class of cases in which equity holds a breaching fiduciary liable to pay equitable compensation only if the “but for” test of causation is satisfied (at [106(c)]. Based on his analysis, Coomaraswamy J held (at [108]) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Any fiduciary’s liability for breaches of his duties of skill and care and of prudence and diligence are subject to the doctrines of foreseeability, causation and remoteness. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A fiduciary who is in one of the well-established categories of fiduciaries and who commits a culpable breach of his core duties of honesty and fidelity is liable to pay equitable compensation even if the object of those duties is unable to prove but-for causation. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A fiduciary who is not in one of the well-established categories of fiduciaries and who causes loss to the trust property as a result of an innocent breach of his fiduciary duties is not liable to reconstitute the trust property unless the object of those duties is able to prove at least a but-for causal connection between the breach of fiduciary duty and the loss to the trust fund. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although the case went on appeal, Coomaraswamy J’s holding above was not disturbed as the Court of Appeal determined the case on a different point and found it unnecessary to wade into the morass of complex and thorny issues relating to causation test for equitable compensation (<span class="font-italic">Maryani Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other appeal</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> [2015] 1 SLR 496 at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">Beyonics (HC</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>, Hoo JC (as she then was) explained that the law in relation to a fiduciary in category (b) (at [120(b)] above) should not be read to mean that “but-for” causation was not required as a substantive rule, but as an evidentiary principle that is favourable to the innocent principal. Indeed, this was the position that Coomaraswamy J had earlier adopted in <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management </span>at [61]. Hoo JC held (at [136]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In relation to the less strict approach to causation in <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span>, <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance</span> makes clear that, contrary to a literal reading of the former (as stated at [134]), the fiduciary is not immediately liable for all losses once the principal successfully proves that the breach is “in some way connected” to the loss. Instead, there is thereafter a shift of the evidential burden to the fiduciary to prove that “but for” his breach of fiduciary duties, the loss would still have occurred. Once the principal adduces <span class="font-italic">some</span> evidence to connect the breach to the loss, the evidential burden on causation shifts to the breaching fiduciary. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In the present case, the “but-for” causation did not pose any difficulty for the plaintiffs as my findings on the real cause of the delay in vessel construction (see [100] above) meant that the causal link between Woon’s breach of his duty of loyalty and the loss suffered by the plaintiffs was established. Instead, the question is whether there is a principled way to choose between the two methods put forth by the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In my view, the measure that is based on the value that the Vessel would have been sold at if the Vessel was completed sooner and in accordance with the agreed timeline (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the second method suggested at [117(b)]) should be adopted. This is because the duties Woon breached were non-custodial in nature and the more appropriate remedy is therefore not to restore the parties to their original positions, but to award reparative compensation, a secondary form of liability intended to remedy a breach of a primary duty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In order to unpack what “reparative compensation” entails, it would be necessary to delve into the historical underpinnings of the award of equitable compensation (see generally <span class="font-italic">Agricultural Land Management v Jackson No (2) </span>[2014] WASC 102 (“<span class="font-italic">Agricultural Land Management</span>”) at [334]–[349]; Yip Man and Goh Yihan, “Navigating the Maze: Making Sense of Equitable Compensation and Account of Profits for Breach of Fiduciary Duty” (2016) 28 SAcLJ 884 (“Yip and Goh, “Navigating the Maze””) at paras 39–41).

In terms of equitable compensation, there were two different forms of account: first, a common account; and second, an account on the basis of wilful default. The two correspond to different types of breaches. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 An account of common form is typically ordered when there is a misapplication of trust property in breach of the trustee’s duty to act only in accordance with the terms of the trust: Charles Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty” (2013) 66 Current Legal Problems 307 (“Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty””) at pp 320–321. When a common account is done and the evidence discloses any such unauthorised disbursement, this entry is falsified and the falsification would have the effect of creating a deficit between the account and the fund that the fiduciary must replenish (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by procuring the identical property or paying a sum of money that corresponds to the current market value of the missing property): <span class="font-italic">Agricultural Land Management </span>at [335]; Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty” at p 322; Lusina Ho, “An Account of Accounts” (2016) 28 SAcLJ 849 (“Ho, “An Account of Accounts””) at para 18. Where the trustee makes up for the deficit using the latter method, the trustee is “compensating”, but in truth, such payment is restitutionary or restorative: <span class="font-italic">Libertarian </span>at [168]. It is more analogous to specific performance or a common law action in debt, and is made pursuant to one’s <span class="font-italic">primary</span> obligation to account for one’s stewardship: <span class="font-italic">Agricultural Land Management </span>at [336]; Yip and Goh, “Navigating the Maze”<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 45. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Substitutive compensation has been described as such because the trustee is said to be “substitutively performing” his obligation to produce the original property that had been misapplied: Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty”<span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 322; Steven Elliott,<span class="font-italic"> Snell’s Equity </span>(John McGhee QC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at para 20–034. As this duty to replenish the fund is regarded as a primary duty, considerations of causation, foreseeability and remoteness are irrelevant: Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty”<span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 323. Finally, although I have referred only to the context of a breach of a trustee’s duty, these rules are applicable to custodial fiduciaries, including company directors; the trustee being more commonly referred to as it is the archetypal custodial fiduciary: <span class="font-italic">Agricultural Land Management </span>at [363]; Yip and Goh, “Navigating the Maze”<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 45.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 On the other hand, an account on the basis of wilful default is dependent upon proof of a loss. Such an account would then require the plaintiff to show that the custodial fiduciary, in breach of duty, failed to obtain a benefit for the fund, and on the taking of such an account, the plaintiff can then “surcharge”<span class="font-italic"> </span>the account by the value of the rights that the custodial fiduciary would have obtained if the duty had not been breached: <span class="font-italic">Agricultural Land Management </span>at [347]. Reparative compensation is different from substitutive compensation because it presupposes the existence of a primary duty, the breach of which triggers a secondary obligation to compensate for loss. The award is therefore calculated by asking what loss was <span class="font-italic">caused</span> by the breach: Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty”<span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 323. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Hence, when the breach concerned does not involve a custodial duty, the accounting rules are inapplicable (Ho, “An Account of Accounts”<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 46) and the rules governing claims to reconstitute trust funds do not apply (Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty” at p 326). The purpose of any remedy awarded in such a circumstance, therefore, cannot be restorative (in the sense of restoring a fund), and is compensatory and damage-based instead: Mitchell, “Equitable Compensation for Breach of Fiduciary Duty”<span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 327. This was also the position taken by Ribeiro PJ in <span class="font-italic">Libertarian </span>at [82], where he endorsed the judgment of Tipping J in <span class="font-italic">Bank of New Zealand v New Zealand Guardian Trust Co Ltd </span>[1999] 1 NZLR 664 at 687, especially the holdings pertaining to the principles relevant to breaches involving an element of infidelity or disloyalty: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… in such a case once the plaintiff has shown a loss arising out of a transaction to which the breach was material, the plaintiff is entitled to recover unless the defendant fiduciary, upon whom is the onus, <span class="font-italic">shows that the loss or damage would have occurred in any event</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> without any breach on the fiduciary’s part. Questions of foreseeability and remoteness do not arise in this kind of case either. Policy dictates that fiduciaries be allowed only a narrow escape route from liability based on proof that the loss or damage would have occurred even if there had been no breach. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As the second method proposed by the plaintiffs (at [117(b)] above) is premised on loss and damage suffered by them, I thus find it to be the applicable method. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Woon’s and Andrew’s evidence was that the Vessel could have been sold for a price between US$9m and US$10m in 2008. It was undisputed that the market deteriorated after 2008, and taking Andrew’s e-mail on 22 November 2011 (see [117(b)] above) into consideration, I find that the Vessel could have been sold at a price of $8m in 2010. The plaintiffs claim a 60% share of the proceeds from the sale of the Vessel, and this would amount to US$4.8m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I reach this finding by considering the remedial consequences of the breach of the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the good faith of the JV. Although I have found that Woon owed a number of other duties – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to account for costs incurred in the Vessel construction, to manage and control the construction, and to exercise due care and skill in doing so – TBS was not seeking a remedial response over and above the two methods outlined above at [117].  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">TBS’s claim against UWM for equitable compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 UWM, being the party dishonestly assisting the primary fiduciary (Woon) in breach in respect of the losses suffered by the plaintiffs, would also be liable to pay equitable compensation for the plaintiffs’ losses caused by the breach of Woon’s duty: <span class="font-italic">Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Liu Cheng Chan and others </span>[2017] SGHC 15 at [189]; <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity </span>at para 20-033).

</div>
</div>
</div><span class="font-italic"> </span>This liability would be joint and several with Woon’s liability: <span class="font-italic">Von Roll </span>at [117]. I note also that there is no need to show a precise causal link between the assistance and the loss; so long as the loss is caused by the breach of fiduciary duty, it will be recoverable from the accessory: <span class="font-italic">Novoship (UK) Limited &amp; Ors v Yuri Nikitin &amp; Ors </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 908 at [103]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">TBS’s claim against Thia for equitable compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Of the various arguments made against Thia, only the plaintiffs’ argument in relation to Thia’s complicity in the diversion of moneys intended for the Vessel has succeeded. Given the similarity between Thia’s and Woon’s breaches – both of which pertained to the breach of their respective duties of loyalty and fidelity – I find that Thia should be made jointly and severally liable for the $4.8m in equitable compensation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In reaching this finding, I reject Thia’s assertion that the operative end date for allocating responsibility for loss or damage is the date on which Thia resigned from TBS (6 November 2009). As a general rule, once a director resigns from office, he is no longer subject to the fiduciary duties that constrained his conduct during the course of his directorship as such duties exist only because of the special relationship that underpins them: Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law </span>(Academy Publishing, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span>”) at para 09.074. But in circumstances where the breach of duty subsisted during the course of the errant director’s directorship, liability accrued after resignation can nonetheless be counted against the errant director: <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law </span>at para 09.076. In <span class="font-italic">Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley </span>[1972] 1 WLR 443 (“<span class="font-italic">Cooley</span>”), the defendant was the managing director of the plaintiff company but intended to divert business opportunities to himself. He lied about his ill health, resigned and secured the contract for himself. Roskill LJ found that the defendant had come to know of opportunities relevant for the plaintiff but withheld such information when he had a duty to pass it on to the plaintiff. By retaining this information for his own benefit and interest, the defendant had placed himself in a position where his duty and his interests conflicted, and he could not thereafter evade liability for his transgression by merely resigning. Professor Pearlie Koh clarifies in “Once a Director, Always a Fiduciary?” (2003) 62(2) Cambridge Law Journal 403 at p 417 that <span class="font-italic">Cooley </span>stands for the proposition that resignation will not terminate the fiduciary obligations if, but for the resignation, the acts of the director taken in totality would amount to a breach of his obligations of loyalty. Professor Koh also emphasises that the rationale of the rule in this context is to prevent the use of resignation as a device to evade the strict fiduciary obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In the present case, Thia’s breach fell under category (b) (at [120(b)] above). For the purpose of causation, the plaintiffs would have to show that the breach was “in some way connected” to the loss; thereafter, there is a shift of the evidential burden to the fiduciary to prove that “but for” his breach, the loss would still have occurred. It was clear that Thia’s breach was “connected” to the loss, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the loss of the sale proceeds that the plaintiffs would have obtained if the Vessel was sold in 2010 (even on Thia’s case, he was a director of TBS up until 6 November 2009). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Here, the burden is on Thia to show that even if he had not breached his duty to TBS, the losses would still have been suffered. This shift in burden furthers the deterrent function of equitable compensation, and vindicates the high duty owed by a fiduciary to the wrong (<span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance Management </span>at [41]). I find that Thia has not discharged his burden. Mr Yeo’s argument was excessively narrow, as it was limited to disclosure only in relation to where the Vessel was constructed; Mr Yeo therefore argued that even if full disclosure was made in relation to this, the construction of the Vessel would nevertheless have been delayed.

</div>
</div> But as I have found above, Thia’s breach extends beyond that as he had knowledge of and participated in the diversion of moneys intended for the Vessel to the nine other vessels. Thia has not established that the loss would nevertheless be suffered by TBS even if Thia did not participate in these breaches, or if Thia had notified the other shareholders of TBS that the diversion of moneys was taking place. It bears mention that Thia was the party who brought the parties to the Shipbuilding Contract together (at [5] above) and he had agreed with Woon to incorporate UWM to build vessels (including the Vessel) on CFB which would have to be newly set up. He also knew that UWM was facing cash flow issues in 2009 and had agreed to TBS advancing $1.5m to UWM. He was involved in UWM’s finances and he knew that UWM was using the moneys advanced by TBS for the Vessel to construct the nine vessels and to fund the setting up and operations of the CFB shipyard. Thia had such knowledge even while he was a director of TBS. Absent any argument to the contrary, I find that Thia has not shown that TBS would have suffered the losses it did regardless of whether he had breached his duties or not. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Woon’s and UWM’s counterclaims against TBS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Given the overlap between the Woon and UMW’s counterclaims, I will deal with them collectively.

But this was unjustified given that TBS had already advanced more than US$5.6m for the Vessel construction and under the JV the construction costs were agreed at about US$5m. Hence, UWM had no reason to ask for any further construction costs and to withhold delivery of the Vessel on that score. Moreover, TBS was entitled to ask UWM to substantiate the Additional Construction Costs with supporting documents, which UWM had refused to do. It is not disputed that the Statement of Accounts listed a series of invoices which were not exhibited therein. Mr Goh admits that on his best case, UWM would have given invoices to TBS only up to 31 March 2011.

</div> Nevertheless, even taking Mr Goh’s case at its highest, at the time when UWM wrote to TBS in January 2015, invoices from April 2011 had not been given to TBS for it to verify the genuineness of the Additional Construction Costs, and TBS was justified in requesting for further substantiation. In any case, I had earlier remarked that UWM’s own record-keeping of the Vessel construction cost was unreliable (see [40] and [79] above) and would cast doubt on the final figure that made up the Additional Construction Costs. Since UWM’s withholding of the Vessel was wrongful, the plaintiffs should not bear the maintenance costs incurred during this period.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 But when UWM wrote on 29 April 2016 to inform the plaintiffs that it was in the process of selling the Vessel and subsequently informed them on 10 May 2016 that MPA had requested a meeting to effect the change in Vessel registration, the plaintiffs did not provide the necessary assistance. It was not apparent why TBS insisted on knowing about the identity of the potential buyer of the Vessel and why it wanted to have a say in the management of the sales proceeds when its claim at the material point in time centred on getting an account of the unauthorised benefits derived from the breach of fiduciary duties.

Hence, in my view, the plaintiffs have to bear the cost of maintaining and preserving the Vessel from May 2016.  If the plaintiffs had co-operated and the Vessel could have been sold, any further maintenance costs would have been unnecessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The Shipbuilding Contract had come to an end after the Suit was commenced (this being a renunciation that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the plaintiffs no longer intend to be bound by the Shipbuilding Contract: <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng</span> <span class="font-italic">v Lim Jit Ming Bryan and another and another appeal</span> [2015] 3 SLR 92 at [66]) or at the very latest, when UWM wrote to the plaintiffs to inform them that the Shipbuilding Contract was “rescinded” on 16 July 2015. Even if it could be said that the partnership between the JV parties had dissolved prior to May 2016, they nevertheless owed each other fiduciary duties (for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in the final sale and distribution of assets) up until the point when all matters relating to the JV have been settled.

Winding up commences thereafter and all partnership affairs will naturally have to be settled (including the conclusion of uncompleted transactions, payments to creditors, liquidation of assets and distribution of proceeds, if any, to the various partners). Only when all partnership matters have been fully wound up, is the partnership terminated altogether. This distinction between dissolution and final termination has to be underlined. <span class="font-italic">During the interim period before final termination, partners still owe to each other fiduciary duties (eg in the final sale and distribution of assets</span>) and they are therefore obliged to make disclosure.
