<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">1.    This is an application filed

on 2 June 2000 by Manjit Kaur Monica (‘the Applicant’) seeking to set aside a

Statutory Demand dated 17 February 2000 issued by the solicitors of the Respondents,

Standard Chartered Bank (‘the Bank’) and to dismiss the Bank’s

Creditor’s Petition No 1020/2000 dated 19 April 2000 filed against her.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.    On 19 June 2000, an Assistant

Registrar ordered that the Statutory Demand be set aside with costs against the Bank. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    The Bank appealed against that

decision. On 18 August 2000, I allowed the appeal with costs (on an indemnity basis). The

Applicant is appealing against my decision.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    In 1994, the Applicant and her

husband bought a property known as No 197 Yio Chu Kang Road, Singapore 545644 (‘the

Property’) for $1,080,000. They took a loan of $875,000 from the Bank which was

secured by a mortgage on the Property.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    The Applicant refers to her

occupation as that of an estate agent. She said that during the recent recession her sales

nosedived and she and her husband were not able to continue servicing the loan.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    The Bank exercised its rights as

mortgagee and commenced an action in Originating Summons No 18 of 1998 against the

Applicant. On 27 April 1998, the Bank obtained an order for possession. A Writ of

Possession was executed on the Property on 31 July 1998.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    At that time, the front and rear

walls of the terrace house on the Property had been torn down and there were abandoned

articles dumped on the Property.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    The Applicant requested until October

1998 to renovate the premises and find a buyer.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.    On 30 September 1998, a nuisance

order was apparently issued against the Property.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    On 29 October 1998, Knight Frank

valued the fair market value of the Property at $450,000 to $480,000, after an inspection

of the Property.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    Apparently the Applicant and her

husband did not give up possession by end October 1998 as the Sheriff of the Supreme Court

had to issue a notice dated 8 December 1998 threatening eviction.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.    In any event, the Bank managed to

put up the Property for auction on 16 December 1998. The auction was handled by Jones Lang

Wootton (i.e. instead of Knight Frank). The opening price sought was $700,000 but no bids

were received.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    Between 27 December 1998 and 20

January 1999 offers from $585,000 to $610,000 were received through an estate agent Gates

P. Properties and through Jones Lang Wootton.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    Significantly, the Applicant herself

had written to the Bank by a letter dated 5 January 1999 informing the Bank that she had a

buyer for the Property at $550,000. The letter states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘<b>RE: <u>Buyer for No. 197, Yio Chu

  Kang Road</u></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Sir/Madam,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This is to (<i>sic</i>) request that we

  have a buyer for the above property at $550,000. For the short fall of approximately

  $427,000 we are willing to sign a term loan of 10 years. We are able to afford the

  instalments of $5000 per month.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I can pay $5000 on the 28th January 99. I

  will also be able to get one or two (<i>sic</i>) guarantor to support the loan.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Looking forward to an early reply via fax

  No. 2241814.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    On 3 February 1999, one Noorimah Bte

Mohd Akber from the Bank contacted the Applicant to inform her that the Bank had sold the

Property for $650,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    With this sale, a shortfall

resulted. After the sale was completed, the balance due to the Bank as at 5 May 1999 was

$343,970.64 (‘the Shortfall’).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    The Bank’s solicitors sent a

letter of demand dated 14 May 1999 to the Applicant and her husband for this sum. Neither

the Applicant nor her husband queried the Shortfall.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    On the contrary, the Applicant was

negotiating with the Bank to pay the Shortfall and did this on a number of occasions i.e.

on 26 July 1999 (when she attended at the Bank’s office), on 27 August 1999, on 24

September 1999 and on 30 September 1999.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.    This was followed by a letter dated

26 October 1999 from the Bank’s solicitors to the Applicant and her husband stating

that the Bank was prepared to allow them to pay the Shortfall (on which interest would be

running) in instalments.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    It is not clear from the affidavits

whether there was a written response to this letter from the Applicant and her husband.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.    In any event, the Bank apparently

followed up by sending a letter to the Applicant and her husband dated 13 November 1999.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.    To this the Applicant replied on 24

November 1999 stating that her husband was requesting a grace period of fourteen days to

respond. Her letter states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘<u>CLAIM BY STANDARD CHARTERED BANK</u></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Housing Loan No. 00382833 Current No.

  02-028-65738</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We (<i>sic</i>) receive your letter on the

  13th November 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">My husband Jeswindar Singh is requesting a

  grace period of 14 days (<i>sic</i>) in respond to your letter of 10th November 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Sorry for any (<i>sic</i>) inconveniences

  caused.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Yours faithfully<br/>

  Sg. Manjit Kaur</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">P/S Please forward all correspondence to

  our office address as above.<br/>

  Thank You.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.    Apparently, sometime before 8

February 2000, the Bank’s solicitors wrote to the Applicant and her husband about

their collecting Statutory Demands issued or to be issued against each of them.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.    On 8 February 2000, the Applicant

replied to the Bank’s solicitors to make an appointment to collect the Statutory

Demands but sought to fix the appointment about one month later i.e. for 6 March 2000. Her

letter states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘Dear Cheryl Lee,</font></p>
<u><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">RE: Your Ref: WL/SCBG/045/06/97 (CH/SS)</font></p>
</u><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I (<i>sic</i>) have rung your office

  last week, and they say you were on leave. However this is to request if I and my husband

  Jeswindar Singh could come and see you personally to receive the Statutory Demand. (<i>sic</i>)

  As my Bankruptcy Proceedings will be withdrawn in about 2 to 3 weeks and I am waiting for

  the Court Order. So could I come and see you together with my husband after it is

  withdrawn. It would be easier if you could serve it on us together as it is the same case.

  Please let me know if this is alright. You could reply this letter to fax number 2950049.

  I could fix an appointment with you for 6<sup>th</sup> March 2000 at 2 p.m. as by then the

  Bankruptcy Proceedings will be withdrawn by then.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Thank you for your co-operation. Sorry for

  any inconvenience caused.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The bankruptcy proceedings referred to in

the letter were probably proceedings by another creditor.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.    Subsequently the Bank’s

solicitors issued a Statutory Demand dated 17 February 2000 against the Applicant

(presumably another Statutory Demand was issued against her husband at around the same

time).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.    The solicitors then wrote on 18

February 2000 to the Applicant and her husband to reject their request to collect the

Statutory Demands on 6 March 2000 in view of earlier unfulfilled promises and threatened

to advertise the same if they were not collected within three days.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.    Eventually the Applicant (and

presumably her husband too) collected the Statutory Demand(s). The date of collection was

not specified in the affidavits before me but it must have been sometime between 18

February 2000 and the end of March 2000 as the Creditor’s Petition against the

Applicant is dated 19 April 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.    The Creditor’s Petition was

served by substituted service by way of posting on the door of the Applicant’s last

known place of residence at Block 5 Normanton Park #03-107 Singapore 119002 on 25 May

2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.    On 30 May 2000, the Bank’s

solicitors sent a cover letter and a copy of the Creditor’s Petition to the Applicant

at Blk 39 Upper Boon Keng Road #15-2408, Singapore 380039. The cover letter informed her

that the hearing of the petition was on 2 June 2000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30.    On 31 May 2000, M/s A. Alagappan

&amp; Co, acting for the Applicant, wrote to the Bank’s solicitors to say that the

petition had not been served on the Applicant and sought information about the exact

address and date when the petition was served.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31.    This was followed by another

fax/letter also dated 31 May 2000 from them stating that the Applicant’s current

address was the address at Upper Boon Keng Road and not the address at Normanton Park. In

this fax/letter they raised the point that the Bank had sold the Property at ‘well

below the Open Market Price’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.    On 2 June 2000, this Originating

Summons was filed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.    As a number of affidavits have been

filed, I will first summarise the main contentions of the parties.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Applicant’s main contentions</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.    Although the Applicant had raised an

issue about invalid service of the petition in her affidavits, her Counsel confirmed that

this was not an issue before me.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.    According to the Applicant and to

one Koh Puay Boon, who had executed two affidavits for the Applicant, Koh had tried to

market the Property in 1998. It was alleged that there was a purchaser who was prepared to

offer $1.2 million through Koh but the Applicant and her husband were willing to sell for

only $1.25 million. That deal fell through.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.    Then, in January 1999, another

agent, one Ms Jazz Ti Ai Lian contacted Koh. After Ms Jazz’s purchasers, Ms Jazz and

Koh had viewed the property, the purchaser allegedly offered $800,000 but the Applicant

and her husband were then asking for at least $880,000. Ms Jazz allegedly said that her

purchaser was still interested but nothing else appears to have developed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.    According to the Applicant and Koh,

Koh was then, in January or February 1999, negotiating with one David Chan who was

prepared to buy the Property at $900,000. However the Applicant wanted $950,000 although

she was prepared to accept $920,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.    The Applicant said that in February

1999, Noorimah from the Bank had called her to inform her that the Bank was going to sell

the Property for $650,000. The Applicant alleged that she told Noorimah that she had a

purchaser (David Chan) who was willing to pay $900,000 and she was trying to get $920,000.

The Applicant also alleged that Noorimah had said she would wait one week for her to

finalise the sale whereupon the Applicant immediately contacted Koh and asked him to

expedite the deal with David Chan. However two days later, Noorimah contacted her and

informed her that the Bank had sold the Property for $650,000. The Applicant said she was

devastated and broke down and cried. Another two days later, Koh called the Applicant to

inform her that David Chan had agreed to buy the Property at $920,000. According to the

Applicant and Koh, it was then that the Applicant told Koh that the Bank had sold the

Property for $650,000. Koh was shocked. The Applicant was crying.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39.    I will refer to the two figures of

$900,000 and $920,000 as ‘Chan’s offers’ for convenience although, even on

the Applicant’s own stand, the $920,000 was not yet offered at the time of the

conversation with Noorimah.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40.    The Applicant also exhibited various

valuation reports of the Property:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) A valuation report by Henry Butcher Appraisal Group

  Pte Ltd (‘Henry Butcher’) dated 26 August 1994. This valued the Open Market

  Value of the Property as of that date to be $1.2 million and the Forced Sale Value to be

  $1.02 million.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) A revised valuation from Henry Butcher via a letter

  dated 10 December 1999 valued the Open Market Value of the Property as at 1 February 1999

  to be $934,000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) The second valuation was repeated in another letter

  dated 11 August 2000 from Henry Butcher reiterating the Open Market Value of the Property

  as at 1 February 1999 to be $934,000 but this time including a Forced Sale Value of

  $793,000 as at 1 February 1999.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Another letter also dated 11 August 2000 from Henry

  Butcher valuing the Open Market Value of the Property as at 1 September 1999 at $1.068

  million and the Forced Sale Value as at the same date as $907,800.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) A valuation report by Newman &amp; Goh dated 10

  January 2000 valuing the Open Market Value of the Property as at February 1999 to be

  $930,000 and as at September 1999 to be $1.1 million.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.    The Applicant also exhibited what

she referred to as Actual Transacted Prices of similar properties i.e. freehold 2-storey

terrace houses in District 19 in February 1999. I should mention that the Property is

actually a 999 leasehold property.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42.    The Applicant did not dispute that

she had sent the letter dated 5 January 1999 to the Bank stating that she had a buyer for

the Property at $550,000. Her explanation was that Noorimah had telephoned her in January

1999 and informed her that the Property was worth less than $500,000. The Applicant felt

indignant and, as a result, she said she would rather ask her sister to buy the Property

for $550,000. It was in this context that she wrote her letter.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.    The Applicant admitted that after

she was informed of the sale by the Bank and the sale price, she had negotiated with the

Bank to allow her to pay the Shortfall in instalments. She said she did this because she

had no choice and alleged that while negotiating, she did repeatedly complain to the

Bank’s officers that the Bank had sold the Property at an undervalue but they had

replied that nothing could be done as the Property had been sold.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44.    As for the Bank’s computer

records of telephone discussions between the Applicant and various officers of the Bank

between February 1999 to November 1999 which showed that there was no allegation by her

then that the Bank had sold the Property at too low a price, she did not accept the

authenticity and accuracy of such records.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.    Also, her Counsel raised the

question of admissibility of such records in view of s 35(1)(c) of the Evidence Act, which

he argued had not been complied with.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46.    I set out below s 35(1)(a) to (c):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘<b>Evidence of computer output</b></font></p>

<blockquote xmlns="">

      not affected by such circumstances.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.    There are other provisions in s 35

which deal with ‘an approved process’ but it is not necessary for me to set them

out.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48.    Although the Applicant was

represented earlier by a firm of solicitors (‘the first firm of solicitors’) in

the Bank’s earlier application for judgment and possession, the Applicant sought to

play down this fact by initially suggesting, in paragraph 9 of her second affidavit signed

on 17 June 2000, that they represented her in that application only and she was not aware

of her legal rights about challenging the undervalue.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49.    In paragraphs 42 and 43 of her third

affidavit filed on 15 August 2000, she said that her husband had a lawyer-friend in the

any fee. However he also informed them that his firm could not afford to do prolonged

litigation for free. It was because she could not afford litigation that she negotiated

with the Bank about instalment payments to pay the Shortfall.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.    The Applicant submitted that she had

established that the Bank had failed in its duty to act in good faith and to take

reasonable care to obtain the best possible price.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.    Alternatively, the Applicant

submitted that there were triable issues which were sufficient for the court to set aside

the Statutory Demand against her.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.    On the alternative submission, the

Applicant relied on Rule 98(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Rules which states:</font></p>

    raises much the same sort of consideration as the "serious question to be tried"

    criterion which arises on an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the

    extension or removal of a caveat. This does not mean that the court must accept

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The Bank’s contentions</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57.    The Bank did not agree that the

Applicant had established that the Bank was in breach of any duty or that there was a

genuine dispute or triable issue.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58.    The Bank had a practice of keeping

records of conversations with their customers. These were kept in a computer and would

identify the officer whose conversation it was. The computer record was not a tape

recording of the actual conversation, but functioned like an attendance note with the

difference, highlighted by the Bank, that the information, once entered into the computer,

could not be amended or deleted.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59.    Noorimah, an Assistant Officer of

the Bank, said that the Applicant did not speak to her on 5 January 2000 but to Sho Eng

Hock, a Customer Assistant Manager of the Bank.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60.    The computer record of this

conversation identified the officer that the Applicant spoke to that day as Sho, and not

Noorimah (although the Applicant said she never spoke to Sho). It also showed that the

Applicant wanted the Bank to agree to a sale at $550,000 to a buyer secured by her. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61.    The computer record also showed that

the Bank was not agreeable to this price as there would still be a balance due of around

$400,000. However, if the Applicant still wanted to proceed with the sale at $550,000, she

could forward her request in writing and indicate the re-payment plan for the balance.

There was no mention in the record about the Applicant’s sister or the indignation of

the Applicant underlying the offer to buy at $550,000. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62.    As regards the Applicant’s

allegation that she had told Noorimah in early February 1999 about Chan’s offers,

Noorimah denied being told this. Noorimah said that on 3 February 1999 she had told the

Applicant that the Bank was selling the Property for $650,000. There was no protest from

the Applicant to the price.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63.    The computer record of this

conversation shows no evidence of any protest by the Applicant. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64.    In response to the Applicant’s

allegation that she had complained not only to Noorimah, but subsequently to other

officers as well, the computer records of the conversations with the officers that the

Applicant had named were also produced (in so far as such conversations in fact took

place). None of these records alluded to any complaint by the Applicant about an

undervalue.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65.    As for the admissibility of such

records, the Bank’s Counsel relied on s 32(b) of the Evidence Act. Section 32(b)

states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘32. Statements, written or verbal,

  of relevant facts made by a person who is dead or who cannot be found, or who has become

  incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of

  delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court

  unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) when the statement was made by such person in the

    ordinary course of business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum

    professional duty, or of an acknowledgment written or signed by him of the receipt of

    money, goods, securities or property of any kind, or of a document used in commerce,

    written or signed by him or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated,

    written or signed by him;’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">66.    However, the Bank did not rely

solely on the computer records.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67.    The Bank relied also on:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    Knight Frank’s valuation of 29

  October 1998 valuing the Property at between $450,000 to $480,000,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    the fact that the auction on 16

  December 1998 with an opening price of $700,000 received no bids,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c)    the offers through Gates B.

  Properties and Jones Lang Wootton between 27 December 1998 and 20 January 1999 were

  between $585,000 to $610,000,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(d)    the Applicant’s own letter

  dated 5 January 1999, one month before the Bank’s sale, in which she requested the

  Bank to allow her to sell the Property at $550,000,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(e)    the fact that after the Applicant

  had been notified of the Bank’s sale and the price, she was seeking the Bank’s

  indulgence to pay the Shortfall by instalments,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(f)    the fact that the Applicant had been

  represented by solicitors in the earlier application by the Bank for judgment of the

  outstanding sum (before the sale) and possession,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(g)    the fact that the Applicant had all

  along, and even when she received the Statutory Demand (in February or March 2000) failed

  to lodge any protest with the Bank until the letter/fax from her new solicitors dated 31

  May 2000 alleging for the very first time, sixteen months after the Bank’s sale, that

  the Property was sold at an undervalue.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68.    The Bank also stressed that the

walls of the house at the Property had been torn down and there were abandoned items

dumped at the Property.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">69.    As for the valuations obtained by

the Applicant, the Bank argued that:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    the subsequent valuations of Henry

  Butcher i.e. after their first valuation dated 26 August 1994, were made without

  inspecting the Property again and were based on the Property’s condition in 1994 i.e.

  <u>before </u>the walls were torn down and the dumping of abandoned items,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    the valuation report by Newman &amp;

  Goh was irrelevant as it was based on an inspection of the external structure nine months <u>after</u>

  the Bank had sold the Property to the new owners who must have rebuilt the Property. In

  fact, that report mentioned that the Property was undergoing refurbishment.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">70.    In short, none of the valuation

reports relied on by the Applicant were based on the actual condition of the house at the

Property in February 1999.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">71.    The Bank also pointed out that it

was strange that Koh’s advertisements in 1998 were to sell the Property at $1.1

million and yet he purportedly received an offer of $1.2 million. Worse still, the

Applicant allegedly refused even to accept the offer at $1.2 million.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">My views on the main contentions</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">72.    Even if Koh had received an offer of

$1.2 million and then $800,000 in 1998, this would be immaterial because neither of the

alleged offers was accepted by the Applicant. However I find it telling that Koh

purportedly received an offer of $1.2 million and that the Applicant had rejected this

offer when Koh’s advertisements (if indeed they were put up by Koh) were seeking $1.1

million only. No one would have offered $1.2 million in response to such advertisements

and it would be equally strange, to put it mildly, for the Applicant to reject such an

offer, if made, which was more than what Koh’s advertisements had sought.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">73.    I am also of the view that the

allegation about Chan’s offers is a false one.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">74.    On 5 January 1999, just one month

earlier, the Applicant had written to persuade the Bank to let her sell the Property at

$550,000. I have set out its contents above. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">75.    The tone and substance of this

letter belies the Applicant’s allegation that it was sent because the Bank had said

the Property was worth $500,000 only. There was no reason for the Applicant to want to

sell the Property to her sister at $550,000, if the Applicant did not believe that this

was a genuine price, as the Applicant would still be liable for the balance. Indeed, the

letter shows that she was aware that she still had to deal with the balance and she even

proposed to get some guarantors for the balance. The Applicant’s allegation about her

indignation was a fabrication to try and avoid the consequences of her own letter. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">76.    Secondly, after the Applicant was

told on 3 February 1999 about the Bank’s sale at the price of $650,000, the Applicant

went on to negotiate over a number of months to pay the Shortfall in instalments. As a

result, the Bank even responded to allow her to pay in instalments via the Bank’s

solicitors’ letter dated 26 October 1999, referred to above.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">77.    The Applicant’s conduct

contradicts her belated allegation about Chan’s offers. I am also of the view that

the principles of waiver, acquiescence and/or estoppel would preclude her from raising

that allegation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">78.    I do not believe for one moment the

Applicant’s excuse that she was unaware of her legal rights or that she had no money

to engage a lawyer for expensive litigation at the time. The Applicant was not a simpleton

and was an experienced estate agent. She did not have to engage a lawyer to know that if

there was indeed an offer of $920,000, she must protest formally <u>and</u> must refuse to

pay the difference between $650,000 and $920,000. She also did not have to engage a lawyer

just to send a letter to record her protest.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">79.    Furthermore, since her husband had a

lawyer-friend who was prepared to represent them in the earlier application for free, it

would have been a simple matter for that same lawyer-friend to have advised them and send

a letter for them without charging them or charging at minimal cost.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">80.    Thirdly, I also note that while the

Applicant claimed not to know her legal rights and to have no money to engage lawyers, she

was in the meantime gathering evidence in the form of valuation reports to use against the

Bank. Hence the second valuation report from Henry Butcher is dated 10 December 1999 and

the valuation report from Newman &amp; Goh is dated 10 January 2000. Both these reports

had stated the Open Market Value of the Property as at February 1999 to be $934,000 and

$930,000 respectively.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">81.    Fourthly, I note that even with the

valuation reports in hand, the Applicant still did not send any letter then to the Bank to

protest about the selling price. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">82.    I am of the view that the Applicant

did not do so even then because she was still trying to find someone to

‘corroborate’ her story about Chan’s offers and/or she was waiting until

the last possible moment to make the protest in writing so as to delay any step being

taken by the Bank against her.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">83.    Fifthly, I am of the view that the

Applicant had used the Henry Butcher and Newman &amp; Goh valuations to come out with the

figures of $900,000 and $920,000 which had hitherto still not been mentioned by her.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">84.    Sixthly, I refer to the

Applicant’s letter dated 24 November 1999, the contents of which have been set out

above. There is no suggestion in that letter of any unhappiness with the Bank about the

selling price and indeed her husband was asking for a grace period to revert to the Bank.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">85.    Seventhly, I refer to the

Applicant’s letter dated 8 February 2000, the contents of which have also been set

out above. Again there is not the slightest suggestion therein of any unhappiness about

the selling price, even though she knew that the Bank’s solicitors were issuing

Statutory Demands against her and her husband.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">86.    Lastly, the computer records of the

telephone conversations also belie her belated allegation about informing Noorimah about

Chan’s offers and informing other bank officers about her unhappiness over the

selling price.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">87.    As for the admissibility of the

computer records, it is not necessary for me to decide whether s 32(b) of the Evidence Act

should prevail over s 35(1)(c) of the Evidence Act or vice versa because:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    when two of such computer records

  were first adduced by the Bank, the Applicant did not challenge their admissibility, and</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    on the contrary, the Applicant later

  challenged the Bank to produce the computer records of the other conversations that she

  supposedly had with other officers (see paragraph 37 of her third affidavit filed on 15

  August 2000).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">88.    In the circumstances, it was not

open to the Applicant to challenge their admissibility.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">89.    In any event, the computer records

simply reinforce the already overwhelming case against the Applicant and I would have

reached the same conclusion even if I should disregard such records.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">90.    Aside from the Applicant’s

allegation about Chan’s offers, the Applicant also appears to be relying on the

valuations of Henry Butcher and Newman &amp; Goh to argue that the Bank’s selling

price was at an undervalue.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">91.    While valuation reports may,

generally speaking, be useful, they are not always the best evidence available. Thus, in <i>Malayan

Banking Bhd v Lim Poh Ho &amp; anor</i> (1997) 1 MLJ 662, the Court of Appeal (in Kuala

Lumpur) said (at p 670):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘The true commercial value of a

  property is not what any valuer thinks it should but, but the actual price that property

  will fetch when it is put up for sale in the open market.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">92.    In the particular circumstances of

this case:</font> </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a)    there was an auction of the Property

  on 16 December 1999 which did not attract a single bid at $700,000,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b)    the subsequent offers through Gates

  B. Properties and Jones Lang Wootton were below $650,000,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c)    the Applicant’s letter dated 5

  January 2000 showed that she herself was trying to persuade the Bank to sell to a buyer

  she had secured at $550,000.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">93.    In these circumstances, the

Bank’s sale price of $650,000 in early February 1999 was clearly the best price

obtainable then.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">94.    Besides, the retrospective valuation

reports of Henry Butcher and Newman &amp; Goh were not reliable for the reasons submitted

by the Bank which I do not need to repeat.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">95.    The Applicant argued that the torn

walls were not material and the house was in as good a condition as when it was bought.

She, and Koh, said that that was why they described the house as being in an

‘original’ condition in their advertisements. Koh even said that this

‘original’ condition was a selling point to those who wanted to renovate the

house.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">96.    On the other hand, the Bank obtained

an opinion from Jones Lang LaSalle dated 14 August 2000 stating that a property cannot be

referred to as ‘original condition’ if there is any work done to it eg.

demolition of a wall.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">97.    I am of the view that the torn walls

were clearly an adverse feature of the house at the Property and the house was clearly not

in its ‘original’ condition. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">98.    As the valuation reports of Henry

Butcher and Newman &amp; Goh were not based on inspections of the Property at the material

time i.e. with the walls torn down, they had no probative value.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">99.    Likewise, the Applicant’s

Actual Transacted Prices of sales of purportedly similar houses in District 19 at the

material time had no probative value as there was no evidence that those similar houses

also had walls torn down. In any event, they are also not the best evidence available in

view of the factors mentioned in paragraph 92 above.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Other allegations of the Applicant</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">100.    For completeness, I will also deal

with other allegations of the Applicant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">101.    The Applicant mentioned that if the

Bank had sold the Property in April 1998, it would have fetched more than $1 million and

if the Bank had sold it in September 1999, it would have fetched $1.068 million. I note

that the Applicant had not even given possession of the Property to the Bank after a Writ

of Possession was executed on 31 July 1998. She was still asking for time to sell the

Property. The Bank was in no position to sell the Property in April 1998.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">102.    In any event, it is for the Bank to

decide when to sell the Property (see, for example, <i>Teo Siew Har v Oversea-Chinese

Banking Corporation Ltd</i> (1999) 3 SLR 129). </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">103.    The Applicant also alleged that the

Bank did not obtain a valuation report from Knight Frank showing the valuation of the

Property as at 9 February 1999. I am of the view that the valuation dated 29 October 1998

was good enough in that the Bank does not have to keep on getting revised valuation

reports before the sale especially in the light of the factors I have mentioned in

paragraph 92 above. Also, in the light of such factors, the Bank is not required to get a

valuation after the sale just to value the Property as at February 1999 to justify the

selling price.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">104.    As I have said, such factors are

better evidence than valuation reports.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">105.    The Applicant raised the argument

that the Bank had attempted to sell the Property at only one auction whereas even the

auctioneers had said there would be three auctions. I would point out that Knight Frank

had in its letter of 29 October 1998 mentioned three of its forthcoming auction dates. It

did not say that there should be three auctions. I would add that there is no obligation

on a bank to attempt to sell at an auction, let alone, at more than one auction. It all

depends on the particular circumstances and, here, there was no reason for the Bank to

attempt to sell at another auction.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">106.    The Applicant argued that by

seeking an opening bid of $700,000 at the auction, the Bank did not believe the valuation

of $450,000 to $480,000 by Knight Frank. I am of the view that this argument is neither

here nor there. There is nothing wrong with the Bank trying to get more for the Property

since it will be the one that bears the Shortfall if the Applicant and her husband cannot

pay the Shortfall.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">107.    The Applicant also argued that the

Knight Frank valuation could not be relied on since the Bank eventually managed to sell

the Property for $650,000. Again this argument is neither here nor there. It is not open

to the Applicant to complain if the Bank got more than the valuation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">108.    The Applicant also argued that she

had not been kept informed of the subsequent offers received by the Bank. I note that the

computer records of conversations show that she was informed of at least one of the

offers. In any event, this argument is also neither here nor there. The Bank is not

obliged in law to keep her informed of the offers it receives.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">109.    The Applicant also raised the point

that the Bank did not show examples of the advertisements by it or on its behalf to sell

the Property.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">110.    The Applicant relied on <i>Standard

Chartered Bank Ltd v Walker </i>(1982) WLR 1410 in which it was alleged that a receiver

had sold the charged stock too quickly without giving enough time for overseas buyers to

attend the auction and enough notice generally and the auction was held at the wrong time

of the year when it was too cold. In those circumstances, the court thought that thee were

triable issues of fact.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">111.    The Applicant also relied on <i>Lee

Nyet Khiong v Lee Nyet Yun Janet</i> (1997) 2 SLR 713 in which the court held that the

advertisement to sell the property was woefully inadequate as, for example, it did not

mention that the house thereon had been extensively renovated. The advertisement appeared

only once and the period of two weeks for tenders to be submitted was considered too short

in the circumstances.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">112.    The Applicant further relied on <i>Cuckmere

Brick v Mutual Finance </i>(1971) Ch 949 in which the court held that the mortgagee had

failed in its duty in selling the mortgaged property without adequately publicising

planning permission had been obtained to build flats.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">113.    The suggestion to me was that the

advertisements on behalf of the Bank should have mentioned that the Applicant was seeking

approval to enlarge the house.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">114.    In my view even if, for the sake of

argument, the Applicant was seeking approval to enlarge the house, the Applicant had not

yet obtained such approval. This distinguishes the case before me from <i>Cuckmere Brick</i>.

Furthermore, approval to enlarge a house is quite different from approval to build flats.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">115.    In any event, the advertisements by

the Applicant herself, and those purportedly by Koh as well, also did not mention that

approval was being sought to enlarge the house.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">116.    Whatever the excuses, the fact is

that the Property remained unsold by the Applicant (and Koh) until February 1999

notwithstanding that they ‘aggressively marketed the Property’ and had

‘also informed a network of agents about the Property’ and had purportedly

showed these agents plans to enlarge the Property. It will be recalled that the Applicant

herself could find a buyer at $550,000 only, in January 1999. In addition, there was an

auction on behalf of the Bank which was not successful and thereafter efforts were

continued by other estate agents to find buyers for the Property</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">117.    The facts before me are very

different from the cases relied on by the Applicant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">118.    In my view, the Applicant’s

complaint about there being no evidence of the Bank’s advertisements of the Property

was really an attempt by the Applicant to fish for evidence to use against the Bank.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">119.    The Applicant also complained that

when Noorimah had told her about the Bank’s sale, Noorimah had promised that she

would arrange a 15-year interest-free loan. Again this is not a valid point. In the first

place, Noorimah (who is an assistant officer) obviously had no authority on her own to

grant such a loan. In any event, the point is irrelevant to the case before me. It is open

to the Applicant to sue the Bank on this promise if it is valid and binding and this point

was not pursued by her Counsel.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">120.    I should also mention one other

point. The Applicant tried to make much about the Bank’s initial omission to exhibit

the computer records or to file an affidavit by Noorimah to deny the alleged conversation

about Chan’s offers.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">121.    In my view that omission was

clearly due to the over-confidence or lack of experience of the Bank’s solicitors and

did not give rise to an inference that the Bank’s or Noorimah’s denial was

untrue.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">122.    Besides, as I have said, even

without the computer records, I would have reached a similar conclusion.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Summary</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">123.    It is in the Bank’s own

interest to get as high a price as possible for the Property. There is no reason for

Noorimah or the Bank to shut out an offer of $900,000 or $920,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">124.    The Applicant’s own letter

trying to persuade the Bank to allow her to sell at $550,000, and her conduct over a few

months, subsequent to the Bank’s sale, in seeking an instalment scheme to pay the

Shortfall, and her subsequent letters asking for a grace period to respond to the Bank and

for time to collect the Statutory Demands demonstrate that her belated allegations are not

genuine and are but a sham in order to play for some more time.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">125.    I also note that even at $920,000,

the difference is $270,000. The Shortfall (as at 5 May 1999) was $343,970.64. The

Applicant had still not paid the Bank the ‘balance’ of about $73,000 at the time

of the Statutory Demand.</font></p>
