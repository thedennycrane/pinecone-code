<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This registrar’s appeal is another chapter
                    in this epic piece of litigation which has occupied the courts in Singapore
                    since 2004. The plaintiff, Beckkett Pte Ltd (“Beckkett”), wishes
                    to be free of the Singapore proceedings in order to pursue remedies against the
                    first defendant, Deutsche Bank AG (the “Bank”), in the courts in
                    Indonesia. This might seem a rather odd course for Beckkett to take since it has
                    been awarded judgment against the Bank by the Singapore courts but has yet to be
                    equally successful in Indonesia. Yet when asked to elect between continuing the
                    Singapore litigation (essentially by proceeding with the assessment of the
                    damages payable by the Bank) and pursuing its Indonesian action, Beckkett chose
                    the latter course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The underlying application, Summons No 5313 of
                    2009, was filed by the Bank on 9 October 2009. By it, the Bank applied for
                    the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     That Beckkett be ordered to withdraw
                        forthwith, and be restrained from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute,
                        the appeal which it had filed in Indonesia against the decision of the
                        District Court of South Jakarta (the “District Court”) in Suit
                        No 649/Pdt.G/2008/PN.JKT.SEL (the “Indonesian action”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
                        Beckkett be restrained from commencing or continuing any further or other
                        proceedings of any nature in Indonesia or anywhere else in the world against
                        the Bank, its agent and/or employees, in relation to the Bank’s sale
                        in Indonesia of the Pledged Shares (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> below) on 21 November 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The application was heard before Assistant
                    Registrar David Lee (the “AR”) over several days. On
                    12 February 2010, the AR released a long and carefully considered judgment
                    ([2010] SGHC 55) giving his reasons for the following findings (at [122]
                    – [126]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the legal proceedings in
                        Singapore and Indonesia were duplicative.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     That in making the application, the Bank had come
                        to the court with clean hands and was entitled to equitable
                    relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     The parties
                        were amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts and that Singapore
                        is the natural forum of the litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     The conduct of Beckkett in maintaining suits in
                        both Indonesia and Singapore after the Singapore Court of Appeal rendered
                        its judgment was vexatious and oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_e"></a>(e)     The circumstances, however, were such that it
                        would be unjust for an anti-suit injunction to be granted against
                        Beckkett.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_f"></a>(f)     It
                        would not be tenable either to maintain the status quo by dismissing the
                        Bank’s application and therefore Beckkett had to be ordered to make an
                        election between proceeding in Singapore for an assessment of damages and
                        pursuing its claim through further appeals in Indonesia. This election would
                        be final and irrevocable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Beckkett did not appeal from this decision.
                    Subsequently it elected to pursue the Indonesian action. The Bank, however,
                    lodged an appeal and maintained before me that the AR’s order giving
                    Beckkett the option of an election should be set aside and, instead, the
                    anti-suit injunction it had applied for should be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Course of the litigation in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The facts giving rise to the original law suit
                    are a matter of public record. They are set out at length in the judgment of the
                    court of first instance, <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG
                        and another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 189 and that of the Court
                    of Appeal, <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another
                        and another appeal</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 452. I will
                    summarise them as briefly as possible (relying a great deal on the AR’s
                    account).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Beckkett is a Singapore company. It and its
                    subsidiary, PT Swabara Mining and Energy (“SME”), owned shares in
                    PT Asminco Bara Utama (“Asminco”) which in turn owned shares in PT
                    Adaro Indonesia (“Adaro”) which owned a coal mine in Kalimantan.
                    SME, Asminco and Adaro are Indonesian companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Bank is incorporated in Germany and has a
                    registered branch in Singapore. In 1997, the Bank extended a loan to Asminco.
                    This loan was supported by a guarantee from Beckkett and pledges by Beckkett and
                    Asminco of their respective shares in SME, Asminco and Adaro (collectively, the
                    “Pledged Shares”). Asminco did not repay the loan and the Bank
                    sold the Pledged Shares to an Indonesian company named PT Dianlia Setyamukti
                    (“DSM”). The sale was completed on 15 February
                2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In April 2004, Beckkett started this action
                    against the Bank. DSM was joined as the second defendant in February 2005.
                    Beckkett claimed the following reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     A declaration that the sale of the
                        Pledged Shares was invalid, null and void and for an order to set it
                        aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
                        declaration that the equity of redemption over the Pledged Shares had
                        thereby been restored to Beckkett, SME and Asminco.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     An order that the Bank and DSM return
                        the Pledged Shares to Beckkett, SME and Asminco
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     Alternatively, damages to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Bank defended
                    the claim and lodged a counterclaim for some US$98m against Beckkett as
                    guarantor of the loan to Asminco.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The trial of the action occupied some 50 days in
                    the High Court before Kan Ting Chiu J (“the Judge”). Judgment
                    was reserved and delivered on 21 September 2007. The Judge dismissed
                    Beckkett’s claim against DSM and the Bank’s counterclaim against
                    Beckkett. He found (at [152]) that Beckkett had made out a claim that the Bank
                    had failed to discharge its duties as pledgee when it sold the Pledged Shares
                    but had failed to show that the Bank had sold those shares at an undervalue. The
                    Judge therefore awarded Beckkett nominal damages of $1,000. Both Beckkett and
                    the Bank appealed against this decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The appeals were heard on 23 April 2008
                    and judgment was reserved. On 27 April 2009, the Court of Appeal delivered
                    judgment and allowed the Bank’s appeal in full and Beckkett’s appeal
                    in part. The relevant findings of the Court of Appeal at [143] of its judgment
                    are that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Bank, in exercising its power of
                        sale, did not take proper steps to sell the Pledged Shares at the best price
                        and was therefore in breach of its duty as pledgee and Beckkett had proved
                        that some of the Pledged Shares had been sold at an
                    undervalue.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was
                        not possible to determine whether the sale of the SME Shares had been at an
                        undervalue until the values of other shares had been
                    determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Beckkett was entitled to have its loss, if any, determined at an inquiry
                        for damages and it was further entitled, as guarantor of the loan, to prove
                        any undervalue with respect to the Pledged Shares and to set the same off
                        against the Bank’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Having regard to the subsequent developments relating to
                        some of the Pledged Shares and the conduct of Beckkett, it would be wholly
                        inequitable for the court to set aside the sale of the Pledged
                        Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Court of Appeal made orders to the
                    following effect:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     It dismissed Beckkett’s appeal
                        against the Judge’s decision to dismiss its claims to set aside the
                        sale of the Pledged Shares against the Bank and/or DSM.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     It allowed Beckkett’s appeal
                        against the decision of the Judge dismissing Beckkett’s claim for
                        damages against the Bank and ordered that such damages be assessed before
                        the Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     It ordered that judgment on the Bank’s counterclaim against Beckkett
                        be stayed pending the completion of the assessment of
                damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Course of litigation in Indonesia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 2 May 2008, shortly after it had
                    presented its appeal to the Court of Appeal, Beckkett filed the Indonesian
                    action. Essentially its claim was that the sale of the SME shares by the Bank
                    was unlawful under Indonesian law because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The sale of the SME shares was based
                        on <em>penetapans</em> issued by the District Court
                        pursuant to an <em>ex parte</em> application by the
                        Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                            <em>penetapans</em> were successfully challenged by
                        Beckkett and subsequently set aside and revoked on 9 March
                    2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Therefore,
                        the sale of the SME shares was contrary to Indonesian law, being a violation
                        of Articles 1155 and 1156 of the Indonesian Commercial
                    Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that in his judgment at first
                    instance, the Judge had found (at [125] to [127] of his judgment) that the sale
                    of the Pledged Shares was carried out after the <em>penetapans</em> were obtained from the District Court but that the
                        <em>penetapans</em> had been set aside by the Jakarta
                    High Court and had not been reinstated. He further held that under Indonesian
                    law, the position was that there were no valid approvals for the sale and that
                    the sale was not carried out by lawful means. The issues of the legality of the
                    sale and the status of the <em>penetapans</em> were
                    integral parts of the case presented by Beckkett before
                Kan J.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The reliefs claimed by Beckkett in the
                    Indonesian action concerned the return of the SME shares and a declaration that
                    it was the owner of these shares that it had pledged to the Bank. Beckkett also
                    wanted declarations that the sale of the SME shares effected by the Bank was
                    illegal and legally defective and that two documents, the Deed of Sale and
                    Purchase and the Deed of Minutes, were null and void and any other documents
                    based on the same were similarly null and void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Bank responded to the Indonesian action on
                    30 October 2008 by filing an application known as an “Absolute
                    Competency Exception” in the District Court. Basically, it sought a stay
                    of the Indonesian proceedings on the ground that Singapore was the proper forum
                    under the relevant loan documentation and that Beckkett had acted in bad faith
                    by filing its claim in Indonesia. This application was rejected on
                    8 January 2009. The Bank did not appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Indonesian action then proceeded on its
                    merits. On or about 8 April 2009, the District Court dismissed the suit. On
                    13 April 2009, Beckkett filed an appeal against that decision (the
                    “First Indonesian Appeal”). This was some two weeks prior to the
                    issue of judgment by the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsequent developments in Singapore and Indonesia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 25 May 2009, Beckkett filed a summons
                    for directions for the assessment of damages in the Singapore High Court. Some
                    three months later, on 24 August 2009, the Bank’s solicitors in
                    Singapore wrote to Beckkett’s solicitors to ask Beckkett to withdraw the
                    First Indonesian Appeal. The substantive response, only given on
                    17 September 2009, was that Beckkett did not intend to withdraw the First
                    Indonesian Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 28 September 2009, the Bank’s
                    Indonesian counsel received a notice from the High Court of Jakarta (the
                    “JHC”) informing him that the JHC had received the documents in
                    the First Indonesian Appeal from the District Court. The parties accepted that
                    as the appeal was against the whole of the District Court’s judgment, the
                    JHC was able to decide the First Indonesian Appeal on the basis only of the
                    court record and the documents tendered by the parties before the District
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Bank filed its application for an
                    anti-suit injunction in Singapore on 9 October 2009, having informed the
                    court two days earlier that it intended to do so. The hearing of the application
                    took place on 18 November 2009 and the parties subsequently filed several
                    sets of supplementary written submissions. The final set of submissions was put
                    in by Beckkett on 4 December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The JHC released its decision on the First
                    Indonesian Appeal on 12 January 2010. The appeal was unsuccessful. On or
                    about 26 January 2010, however, Beckkett lodged an appeal (the
                    “Second Indonesian Appeal”) against this decision to the Supreme
                    Court of Indonesia. As at the date of writing, no decision has been rendered on
                    the Second Indonesian Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For completeness, I reiterate what happened
                    thereafter. On 12 February 2010, the AR ordered Beckkett to elect between
                    the legal proceedings in Singapore and Indonesia. On 26 February 2010,
                    Beckkett elected to pursue its claims and remedies in Indonesia. It did not file
                    an appeal against the AR’s decision. On 4 March 2010, the Bank lodged
                    the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Since Beckkett has not appealed against the
                    decision of the AR, it is in no position to challenge any of the holdings that
                    he made. Thus, any issue that the AR decided in favour of the Bank and against
                    Beckkett cannot be re-litigated in this appeal. The main issue to be decided on
                    the appeal, therefore, is whether in all the circumstances, including his
                    findings, it was the right course for the AR to put Beckkett to an election
                    instead of issuing an anti-suit injunction against Beckkett. There are some
                    sub-issues to be considered in this connection but before I deal with the issues
                    on appeal, it may be useful to revisit the AR’s findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The issues that arose before the AR were the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether there was duplication in the
                        Singapore and Indonesian proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the Bank went before the court “with clean
                        hands”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the requirements for an anti-suit injunction were
                    met.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the
                        court ought to put Beckkett to an election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I am not
                    going to repeat the arguments that the parties made before the AR in relation to
                    these issues but I will set out his findings and reasons, indicating where these
                    need to be revisited in the context of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the first issue, that of duplication, the
                    AR rejected Beckkett’s submission that there were different causes of
                    action in Singapore and in Indonesia and therefore the two sets of proceedings
                    were distinct. The AR considered that the fundamental point was that the reliefs
                    sought in both jurisdictions <em>vis-à-vis</em> the return
                    of the Pledged Shares were essentially the same and that both sets of
                    proceedings had identical features including the reliance on alleged failure to
                    comply with certain articles of the Indonesian Civil Code. He found that the
                    situation went beyond multiplicity of proceedings and was a duplication of
                    proceedings because in both jurisdictions the reliefs sought were the same, the
                    parties were the same, the underlying bases for the causes of action were the
                    same and the underlying transaction was the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It should be noted that the AR’s opinion
                    was that “[w]hile Beckkett may not be faulted in commencing the action in
                    Indonesia while it was waiting for the Singapore Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment ... once the Singapore Court of Appeal’s judgment was rendered,
                    or once a reasonable period of time thereafter had lapsed ... Beckkett’s
                    justification for maintaining the Indonesian action out of prudence
                    evaporated”. My view on this is different but I will explain
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The AR rejected Beckkett’s submission
                    that the Bank had failed to come to the court with clean hands. In this
                    connection he held:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     The argument, made with reference to
                        a certain submission in the Bank’s Appellant’s Case for the
                        appeals before the Singapore Court of Appeal, that the Bank had been blowing
                        hot and cold and had challenged Beckkett to bring a suit in Indonesia, was
                        misplaced. The Bank’s submission had to be read in its proper context
                        and since the Bank had defended the claim in Singapore all the way to the
                        Court of Appeal, it was a leap of logic to suggest that some few sentences
                        in its submission were in effect an open challenge to Beckkett to bring a
                        suit in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     The argument that the Bank’s failure to challenge the District
                        Court’s finding on jurisdiction by failing to appeal against the
                        rejection of its Absolute Competency Exception application should be held
                        against it when it sought the equitable relief of an anti-suit injunction in
                        Singapore initially appeared an attractive one to the AR. He rejected it
                        because he considered that a reasonable litigant in the Bank’s
                        position had two options when its application was rejected: either to appeal
                        on jurisdiction or to defend the main action. The Bank in deciding not to
                        appeal may have been prompted by an interest in seeing a speedy resolution
                        of the Indonesian action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     The argument that the Bank had waived its right to an
                        election was rejected. The AR considered that the authorities cited by
                        Beckkett were of doubtful value for the proposition that the Bank’s
                        conduct amounted to a waiver and, in any case, his view was that the
                        Bank’s conduct in defending the action on the merits in Indonesia was
                        reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     Looking at the conduct of the parties as a whole, while there may be have
                        been some delay on the part of the Bank in bringing the application for an
                        anti-suit injunction, that delay did not imbue the application with the lack
                        of <em>bona fides</em>. It was not such a significant
                        delay as to enable the court to reasonably impute a level of mischief or bad
                        faith to the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Next, the AR dealt with the legal requirements
                    for an anti-suit injunction. He based his analysis on the framework set out in
                        <em>John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and
                        others</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 (“<em>Kirkham</em>”) in relation to the principles to be applied
                    when considering whether to grant an anti-suit injunction. Using this framework,
                    he found:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the parties were amenable to
                        the Singapore courts’ jurisdiction since they had been actively
                        engaged in this litigation before the courts for no less than five
                        years.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     That at
                        that point in time (<em>ie</em> the time at which the
                        anti-suit injunction was being considered), Singapore rather than Indonesia
                        was the natural forum for the dispute because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_26-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The parties had more than
                            five years of litigation in Singapore as opposed to less than one year
                            of litigation in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_26-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The parties were continuing to litigate in
                            Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Bank had established a <em>prima facie</em>
                        case that Beckkett’s conduct had been vexatious and oppressive. When
                        Beckkett first commenced the Indonesian action, since the Court of Appeal
                        had not delivered judgment, Beckkett’s conduct was not vexatious or
                        oppressive because it did not know what the outcome of the Singapore action
                        would be. However, the situation changed when the Singapore Court of Appeal
                        judgment was rendered because it dismissed Beckkett’s claim for a
                        return of the Pledged Shares and ordered a remedy of damages only. It then
                        became vexatious and oppressive on the part of Beckkett to maintain the
                        Indonesian action concurrently in the hope of getting the Pledged Shares
                        back. In this connection, the following passage from the AR’s judgment
                        is of special interest:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">108    ... I am of the view that part of the
                                Court’s protection of its jurisdiction, processes and
                                judgments, as well as its preservation of the principle of finality
                                requires a finding that Beckkett’s persistence in both
                                jurisdictions <em>after</em> the Singapore
                                Court of Appeal’s judgment was rendered, is vexatious and
                                oppressive. Quite simply, the Singapore Court of Appeal had
                                dismissed Beckkett’s claim for a return of the Pledged Shares.
                                To condone Beckkett’s persistence in the Indonesian
                                proceedings without any sanction runs the risk that Beckkett may end
                                up with a remedy that is inconsistent with the finding of the
                                Singapore Court of Appeal. That would erode the sanctity to be found
                                in the principle of finality, and may even send a wrong signal to
                                future litigants that a Singapore Court of Appeal judgment is not
                                worth much if one has sufficiently deep pockets to pursue another
                                remedy in a foreign (and probably more favourable) jurisdiction
                                after exhausting all avenues in Singapore and failing here.
                                (emphasis in original)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     Nevertheless,
                        Beckkett had discharged the burden on it to demonstrate that it would be
                        unjust to Beckkett to grant an anti-suit injunction. Beckkett had propounded
                        a correct principle of law in arguing that it was entitled to elect the
                        remedy it wanted for the Bank’s breach only at the point of
                        enforcement. To order an injunction now would be tantamount to staying the
                        Indonesian proceedings and this may in turn rob Beckkett of the fruits of
                        its labour in the Indonesian proceedings. Since Beckkett could not be
                        faulted for commencing the Indonesian proceedings but could only be faulted
                        for maintaining them after the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal, it
                        would be unjust to grant an anti-suit injunction and rob Beckkett of the
                        right of a successful appeal in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On the issue of whether Beckkett ought to be
                    put to an election, the AR considered that to let things remain at status quo
                    would also lead to an unjust result. Beckkett’s submission that
                    undertakings would be sufficient was rejected since the AR considered them
                    inadequate to address the potential prejudice, both to the parties as well as to
                    the sanctity of the principle of finality in the Singapore courts. The
                    court’s discretion to enjoin a party from proceeding in another
                    jurisdiction in order to protect the jurisdiction of the local court extended to
                    an order for an election. In coming to his final conclusion, the AR
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">121    ... only an order for a final and irrevocable
                            election within a reasonable time would allow Beckkett to pursue its
                            remedies without the added costs to the Bank or to the Courts of both
                            jurisdictions as a result of Beckkett’s vexatious and oppressive
                            conduct in persisting with its actions in both Indonesia and Singapore.
                            While Beckkett may have demonstrated that it would be unjust for an
                            anti-suit injunction to be granted, it cannot evade from the reality
                            that an order for an election is the just and equitable order to move
                            the litigation between the parties forward.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The basis for this judgment is the AR’s
                    finding that the Singapore and Indonesian proceedings are concurrent and
                    duplicate proceedings. I have no reservations about the correctness of that
                    finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The authorities show that if duplicate
                    proceedings are conducted concurrently in two different courts or two different
                    jurisdictions by a plaintiff, that plaintiff bears the burden of justifying the
                    continuance of the concurrent proceedings. See <em>Australian
                        Commercial Research and Development Ltd v ANZ McCaughan Merchant Bank
                        Ltd</em> [1989] 3 All ER 65 at 70 and <em>Yusen Air &amp; Sea Service (S) Pte Ltd v KLM Royal Dutch
                        Airlines</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 955 (“<em>Yusen</em>”) at [27]. In this case, the AR has found
                    that Beckkett was not able to justify the continuance of both the Singapore and
                    the Indonesian proceedings. That finding stands and I have no quarrel with

                    Reissue, 2001) as to the options available to the court when there are
                    concurrent and vexatious proceedings in two different jurisdictions. These
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     to require the plaintiff to elect
                        which set of proceedings he wishes to continue; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     to stay the local proceedings;
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     to grant an
                        anti-suit injunction restraining the plaintiff from pursuing the foreign
                        proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In this context it is also pertinent to bear
                    in mind the following observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>Yusen</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    In our judgment, when a plaintiff sues the same
                            defendant in two or more different jurisdictions over the same subject
                            matter, the defendant can take up an application to compel the plaintiff
                            to make an election as to which set of proceedings he wishes to pursue.
                            For the purposes of an election, the considerations of <em>forum conveniens</em> do not come into play. However,
                            the defendant would need to demonstrate a duplicity of actions in the
                            different jurisdictions. Once this is established, the burden of proof
                            then shifts to the plaintiff to justify the continuance of the
                            concurrent proceedings by showing ‘very unusual
                            circumstances’. If the plaintiff fails to demonstrate such unusual
                            circumstances, he would have to make an election.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    It is also our considered view that the
                            plaintiff’s election is not the only way to resolve this issue.
                            Apart from compelling the plaintiff to elect, it remains open to the
                            defendant to take up an application for a stay of local proceedings or a
                            restraint of foreign proceedings if the defendant wishes to have the
                            action tried in one of the jurisdictions where the plaintiff has
                            commenced an action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The issue that falls squarely to be decided by
                    me is whether in all the circumstances of this case it served the ends of
                    justice to allow Beckkett to make an election rather than to compel Beckkett to
                    drop the Indonesian action and continue only with the present action by
                    proceeding with the assessment of damages. To answer this question, I will first
                    consider the extent of Beckkett’s vexatious conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It would be recalled that the AR’s
                    finding was that Beckkett’s maintenance of the Indonesian action only
                    became vexatious when it failed to discontinue the same after the Singapore
                    Court of Appeal delivered its judgment. His three reasons (at [106] to [110] of
                    his judgment) for that finding were that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     The prejudice to both parties in
                        pursuing concurrent proceedings was not capable of compensation by any order
                        of costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        concurrent proceedings threatened the court’s jurisdiction, processes
                        and judgments, as well as the principle of finality.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     If both sets of proceedings were
                        allowed to continue abreast, the inevitable risk was that one set of
                        judicial resources would be wasted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The AR placed a great deal of emphasis on the
                    threat to the court’s jurisdiction, processes and judgments, as can be
                    seen from his repetition of this point in more than one place in his decision.
                    That that emphasis was well placed is indicated by <em>Dicey,
                        Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws</em> (Sir Lawrence Collins
                    gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) (“<em>Dicey
                        &amp; Morris</em>”) at [12-069] to [12-074]. In its discussion
                    at [12-070], <em>Dicey &amp; Morris</em> states that the
                    English court will restrain proceedings which interfere with its due process or
                    with its jurisdiction to decide cases pending before it and, at [12-073], also
                    proceedings which interfere with or undermine the control of the English court
                    of its own process. The point was further emphasised by <em>Masri
                        v Consolidated Contractors (UK) Ltd &amp; Ors (No 3)</em>
                        (“<em>Masri</em>”), an authority also
                    relied upon by the AR. Several passages from the judgment of Lawrence
                    Collins LJ bear citing:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">82    I do not accept the judgment debtors’
                            argument that there is a principle ... that the English court will not
                            restrain relitigation abroad of a claim which has already been the
                            subject of an English judgment adverse to the person seeking relitigate
                            abroad. It has been established since at least 1837 that the fact that
                            the respondent is seeking to relitigate in a foreign jurisdiction
                            matters which are already res judicata between himself and the applicant
                            by reason of an English judgment can be sufficient ground for the grant
                            of an anti-suit injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Protection of the jurisdiction</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">83    In <em>Bank of Tokyo Ltd v Karoon
                                (Note)</em> [1987] AC 45, 63, Robert Goff LJ
                            referred to the public interest in the finality of litigation, and said
                            that there were authorities in England and the United States in which
                            courts had granted injunctions restraining persons properly amenable to
                            their jurisdiction from relitigating matters which had already been the
                            subject of a judgment of the court of the forum ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85    ... I doubt whether it is profitable to do more
                            than note that the protection of the jurisdiction of the English court
                            and its judgments by injunction has a long lineage. In my judgment there
                            is no reason to doubt that in appropriate cases the English court may
                            enjoin a foreign defendant against whom there is an English judgment (in
                            proceedings to which the foreign defendant has submitted) from seeking
                            to relitigate the same issues abroad.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">100    ... It is consistent with principle for an English
                            court to restrain relitigation abroad of a claim which has already been
                            subject of an English judgment. There is long-established authority that
                            protection of the jurisdiction of the English court, its process and its
                            judgments by injunction is a legitimate ground for the grant of an
                            anti-suit injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The above passages were cited by the AR as
                    well. Whilst he realised that they highlighted the importance of finality in
                    legal proceedings and the need for the court to protect its own jurisdiction,
                    processes and judgments, he did not perhaps fully appreciate the impact that
                    these statements of the law should have had on his assessment of the vexatious
                    conduct of Beckkett. The situation here was that Beckkett had commenced a claim
                    in Singapore against the Bank and had taken the matter to a long trial, after a
                    number of interlocutory applications. It had succeeded, to an extent, against
                    the Bank at first instance but not sufficiently in that it was given only a
                    nominal remedy. It had therefore appealed and had followed the appeal through
                    fully until all that was left to do was to await the decision of the Court of
                    Appeal. It was at that stage that Beckkett started the Indonesian action and, in
                    my judgment, commenced its course of vexatious conduct. Beckkett was uncertain
                    of the relief that it would get from the Court of Appeal and therefore sought to
                    secure its position by seeking the same relief from the Indonesian courts. If
                    Beckkett indeed got the relief it prayed for in Indonesia before the Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment was given, that must have threatened the jurisdiction,
                    processes and judgments of the Singapore courts and undermined the principle of
                    finality. There would have been an immense waste of judicial resources in
                    Singapore. Quite apart from the length of the High Court and Court of Appeal
                    decisions and the time spent by the respective courts considering and weighing
                    the evidence, the submissions and the law, there were five years of extremely
                    contentious litigation involving the courts at all levels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     When Beckkett started the Indonesian action,
                    the Bank had two options: to contest the jurisdiction of the Indonesian court
                    and to apply for an anti-suit injunction. These were not mutually exclusive
                    options. The Bank could have done both at the same time. Instead, it chose the
                    first option and when this failed, it engaged Beckkett on the merits. It does
                    not seem to have occurred to the Bank at any time prior to the result of the
                    First Indonesian Appeal that it could have applied for an anti-suit injunction
                    in Singapore. While it may seem immaterial at this stage, my view of the
                    situation is that the Bank had a very strong chance of succeeding in such an
                    application had it been brought shortly after the Indonesian action was started.
                    What is material now is whether the Bank’s failure to apply earlier and
                    its decision to participate in the Indonesian action should prejudice the
                    strength of its case now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The AR considered this issue as being one of
                    “clean hands”. He resolved it in favour of the Bank. Primarily,
                    the AR considered that the Bank had acted reasonably in contesting the
                    Indonesian action on the merits. Whilst Beckkett, having not appealed the
                    AR’s decision, cannot now challenge that judgment in relation to the
                    determination that its conduct was vexatious, it can still rely on the
                    Bank’s conduct to support the remedy of election and to contend that such
                    participation bars the Bank from asking for an anti-suit
                injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In relation to the doctrine of clean hands,
                    ICF Spry, <em>The Principles of Equitable Remedies</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 7th Ed, 2007) states at p 409:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not uncommon to find broad statements that a plaintiff is not
                        granted an injunction if he does not have clean hands. Properly understood
                        these statements are correct; but they should be applied cautiously, for it
                        is by no means true that a plaintiff who has acted unconscionably is refused
                        all access to the court or that he is considered to be beyond protection for
                        all purposes. ... It has been said that the principle on which the court
                        acts is that protection is denied the plaintiff “where the right
                        relied on, and which the court of equity is asked to protect or assist, is
                        itself to some extent brought into existence or induced by some illegal or
                        unconscionable conduct of the plaintiff”, so that protection for what
                        he claims involves protection for his own wrong: “No court of equity
                        will aid a man to derive advantage from his own wrong, and this is really
                        the meaning of the maxim.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Also interesting is the footnote to the last sentence, which
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Meyers v Casey</em> (1913) 17 CLR 90 at
                        p 124. Isaacs J was not, however, considering cases where the
                        court had been deceived or <em>its procedure otherwise
                            abused. In these cases also relief is said to be refused because the
                            plaintiff does not have clean hands</em>. So in <em>Armstrong v Sheppard &amp; Short Ltd</em> [1959]
                        2 QB 384 at p 397 ground for refusing an injunction was found
                        in an attempt to mislead the court. See also <em>Carmen v Fox
                            Film Corporation</em> (1920) 269 F 928 (US). (emphasis
                        added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Bank explained that it had participated in
                    the Indonesian action because at the time the District Court rejected its
                    challenge to the jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal had not given its decision
                    whereas the Judge had found that the sale had been carried out by unlawful means
                    under Indonesian law. Having decided not to appeal in Indonesia, the Bank had to
                    contest the Indonesian action to prevent default judgment from being entered
                    against it. While I can understand the Bank taking protective action to avoid a
                    default judgment, what I do not understand and what the Bank did not explain,
                    was why it did not at the same time apply in Singapore for an anti-suit
                    injunction against Beckkett. To participate substantively in the Indonesian
                    action which threatened to undermine the process of the Singapore courts without
                    making any attempt in Singapore to stop Beckkett’s prosecution of such
                    proceedings was, to my mind, wrongful conduct on the part of the Bank and, in a
                    normal case, would prejudice its application for an anti-suit
                injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In this case, however, the fact that the Bank
                    participated in the foreign proceedings cannot <em>ipso
                        facto</em> mean that its application for an anti-suit injunction must
                    be rejected. This is because a denial of the anti-suit injunction would also
                    have the effect of perpetuating the wrong instigated by Beckkett <em>ie</em> the vexatious and oppressive Indonesian action that
                    was started after Beckkett had had a full trial of its claim in Singapore and
                    presented its appeal. In my view, while it is always vexatious for a plaintiff
                    to start concurrent proceedings in different jurisdictions against the same
                    defendant for the same reliefs arising out of the same cause of action, the
                    present case is particularly egregious because of the stage that the proceedings
                    in Singapore had reached when the Indonesian action was started.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The court in deciding whether to grant an
                    anti-suit injunction must always have regard to what the ends of justice
                    require. This means that the court must consider not only the injustice to the
                    defendant if the plaintiff is allowed to pursue the foreign proceedings but also
                    the injustice to the plaintiff if he is not allowed to do so. See <em>Société Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale Appellants v Lee Kui
                        JAK and Another Respondents</em> [1987] AC 871
                        (“<em>Lee Kui Jak</em>”) at 896. The AR
                    was concerned that by granting the anti-suit injunction he would be robbing
                    Beckkett of the “fruits of the labour” (at [112] of his judgment)
                    it had put into the Indonesian action. In other words, the advantage which an
                    anti-suit injunction would have deprived Beckkett of was the stage and
                    development of those proceedings which had been reached by the effort that
                    Beckkett had made. With due respect to the AR, however, I do not think that the
                    stage of the Indonesian action is a legitimate advantage of which Beckkett
                    cannot be deprived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Beckkett had no business starting the
                    Indonesian action in the first place. This is precisely the sort of action that
                    the principles in <em>Masri</em> prohibit. Beckkett had
                    submitted its claim to the courts of Singapore and had laboured long and hard
                    (and caused the Bank to do so too) to bring it to trial and then before the
                    appellate court. It did not know how the appellate court would decide but that
                    was no excuse for it to attempt to bypass a possibly unfavourable decision of
                    the Singapore courts by taking action in Indonesia. In my view, it was an abuse
                    of the process of the Singapore courts for Beckkett to take steps in Indonesia
                    and no legitimate advantage could be obtained from the same notwithstanding that
                    the Bank participated in the action. At present, although the proceedings in
                    Indonesia have also gone to the appeal stage, they are not as advanced as in
                    Singapore where the Court of Appeal has already given judgment and only the
                    damages need to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     By allowing Beckkett to elect to proceed in
                    Indonesia, the AR was giving Beckkett exactly what it wanted when it started the
                    Indonesian action <em>ie</em> a second attempt to recover
                    the Pledged Shares. Beckkett has by its actions undermined the processes of the
                    Singapore courts and the principle of finality of litigation. In my view, it
                    would not be right for this court to allow its judgments to be ignored by
                    litigants who have sought the aid of this court by starting their litigation
                    here. The ends of justice, not only for Beckkett and the Bank, but also for
                    other litigants who litigate in good faith in the Singapore courts, can only be
                    served by the grant of an anti-suit injunction in circumstances such as the
                    present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The last matter to be considered is whether
                    considerations of comity should inhibit the grant of an anti-suit injunction. It
                    has been held in <em>Royal Bank of Canada v Cooperatieve Centrale
                        Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA</em> [2004] 2 All
                    ER (Comm) 847 at [50] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">considerations of comity grow in importance the longer the foreign suit
                        continues and the more the parties and the judge have engaged in its conduct
                        and management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Given the advanced stage of the Indonesian
                    action, considerations of comity take on importance. However, those
                    considerations must be weighed against the public policy of the Singapore legal
                    system. In the case of <em>Q &amp; M Enterprises Sdn Bhd v Poh
                        Kiat</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 494, Andrew Phang JC stated
                    at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The importance of international comity cannot be underestimated. The
                        domestic courts of each country must constantly remind themselves of this
                        point ... Nevertheless, it ought to be emphasised that the signal importance
                        of the domestic legal system cannot be gainsaid either. Extreme positions on
                        either side of the legal spectrum ought to be avoided. For example,
                        international comity ought <em>not</em> to be accorded
                        if to do so would offend the public policy of the domestic legal system
                        (here, of Singapore). However, that having been said, legal parochialism
                        must also be eschewed. (emphasis in original)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the present case, refusing the anti-suit
                    injunction because of international comity would offend the public policy of the
                    Singapore legal system. It cannot be acceptable to our public policy to permit a
                    litigant to begin a duplicate law suit in a foreign jurisdiction just after
                    being heard by the Court of Appeal. I would go so far as to say that it cannot
                    be acceptable to permit the start of such a duplicate law suit after the
                    completion of a full trial in Singapore, even though judgment may have been
                    reserved and not yet delivered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     For the reasons given above, I allow the
                    Bank’s appeal and make the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff shall withdraw
                        forthwith, and is hereby restrained from prosecuting or continuing to
                        prosecute, the appeal which it has filed in Indonesia against the decision
                        of the Jakarta High Court in Matter No 475/PDT/2009/PT.DKI Jo and/or against
                        the decision of the District Court of South Jakarta in Suit No
                        649/PDT.G/2008/PN.JKT.SEL.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff shall be and is hereby restrained from
                        commencing or continuing any further or other proceedings of any nature in
                        Indonesia or anywhere in the world (apart from Singapore) against the First
                        Defendant, its agents and/or employees, in relation to the First
                        Defendant’s sale in Indonesia of the Pledged Shares on
                        21 November 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     The order of the Assistant Registrar on 12 February
                        2010 is set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>(d)     The costs of this appeal and of the application below shall be taxed
                        (if not agreed) and paid by the Plaintiff to the First
                    Defendant.</p>
