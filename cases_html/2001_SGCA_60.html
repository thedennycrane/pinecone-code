<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">
<p align="justify"></p></font></b>The appellant’s flat was raided by the Central Narcotics

Bureau and 58.83 grams of diamorphine was recovered along with various drug-trafficking

paraphernalia. The appellant’s control of the flat at all material times was not in

issue. The presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act was triggered

and the appellant was duly charged with possession of a controlled drug for the purposes

of trafficking.

<p align="justify" xmlns="">At trial, the appellant raised the defence of consumption, claiming

that he was a severe heroin addict and all the heroin recovered was intended for his own

personal consumption. Moreover, he had sufficient funds to support his habit such that he

did not need to resort to drug-trafficking. The judicial commissioner rejected the

defence, disbelieving the appellant’s unsubstantiated claims as to the degree of his

addiction and preferring the prosecution’s evidence that the appellant was only a

moderate addict. The judicial commissioner also relied on the appellant’s long

statement to the police, in which he confessed to be a drug trafficker, and on the

drug-trafficking paraphernalia found in the flat. The appellant was sentenced to death and

appealed against his conviction. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>, dismissing the appeal:

<ol xmlns="">
<li>An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact made by a trial judge unless they

    are clearly reached against the weight of evidence – <i>Lim Ah Poh v PP</i>, <i>PP v

    Hla Win </i>(see ¶15).</li>
<li>The judicial commissioner’s finding that the appellant was only a moderate heroin

    addict could not be faulted. It followed from this finding that the defence of consumption

    failed as the amount of diamorphine recovered from the appellant’s flat amounted to a

    seven-month supply of heroin for a moderate addict. Furthermore, even if it was believed

    that the appellant was indeed a severe heroin addict, his </li>
<p align="justify">claims as to the amount he consumed could not be accepted as it far

  exceeded the upper limit of a severe addict’s rate of intake. (see ¶13-14).</p>
<li>Drug-trafficking paraphernalia is relevant in establishing whether a person is a drug

    trafficker – <i>Low Kok Wai v PP</i>. The judicial commissioner’s findings in

    this regard were clearly correct as the appellant’s explanations for the presence of

    the drug-trafficking paraphernalia were extremely far-fetched (see ¶17).</li>
<li>It is clear that an accused person can be convicted solely on his own retracted

    confession if the court is satisfied of its truth. Here, even if the appellant’s

    grounds of appeals were of merit, the length and detail of his long statement were such as

    to warrant the dismissal of the appeal (see ¶18).</li>

of Judgment:</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><em>Delivered by Yong Pung How</em></p>
<p xmlns="">The appellant was tried in the High Court before Choo Han Teck JC on a charge of drug

trafficking pursuant to s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)

(the "MDA"). The judicial commissioner convicted the appellant of the charge and

sentenced him to death by hanging. We dismissed the appeal against the conviction and now

give our reasons. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>The facts </strong></p>
<p xmlns="">2 On 27 November 2000 at about 9.15pm, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau

("CNB") raided the appellant's flat at Block 331, Woodlands Avenue 1, #04-421.

Upon gaining entry, the appellant was spotted dashing into the toilet, from where he was

forcibly removed by the CNB officers and arrested. A quantity of yellowish granular

substance (the "substance") was recovered from the drainage hole of the said

toilet. Apart from the substance, other items seized from the appellant and from various

places in the appellant's flat included:- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(a) Various substances, tablets and powders, including 60 tablets of Erimin 5, one

  sachet of heroin and one straw of heroin; </p>
<p>(b) One pager; </p>
<p>(c) Three handphones; </p>
<p>(d) One electronic weighing scale; </p>
<p>(e) One sealer; </p>
<p>(f) Numerous empty plastic sachets and bags, including "Ziplock" bags; </p>
<p>(g) One drug supervisee card; and </p>
<p>(h) Six uncensored video compact discs ("VCDs"). </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">The appellant's control of the flat at all material times was not in issue. </p>
<p xmlns="">3 Analysis by Dr Saw Chwee Guan of the Department of Scientific Services showed that

the 687.3 grams of dried substance contained not less than 58.83 grams of diamorphine. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>The prosecution's case</strong> </p>
<p xmlns="">4 The prosecution placed reliance on the appellant's long statement, made pursuant to s

121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) (the "CPC"), in which the appellant

admitted to drug trafficking by assisting one "Ah Chong" in delivering heroin to

Ah Chong's purchasers. The appellant also trafficked in heroin by purchasing heroin from

Ah Chong for purpose of resale to his fellow addicts. The electronic scale was used to

pack heroin for resale. The appellant's clients would use the pager to contact him, while

Ah Chong would contact the appellant using one of the handphones. On the day of his

arrest, the appellant had collected three bags of heroin from Ah Chong's hireling, one bag

of which he delivered. The appellant was holding on to the other two bags, pending further

instructions from Ah Chong, when the CNB raided his flat. These two bags of heroin

together constituted the substance recovered from the drainage hole. </p>
<p xmlns="">5 The prosecution also pointed out that the appellant's cautioned statement, made

pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC, disclosed no defence to the charge of trafficking.

Instead, the appellant had simply pleaded for leniency as he had an aged mother who had no

one to look after her. </p>
<p xmlns="">6 Finally, the prosecution placed reliance on the evidence of Dr Choo Shiao Hoe

("Dr Choo"), who had treated the appellant for drug withdrawal at Changi Prison

Hospital. Dr Choo had testified that based on the withdrawal symptoms exhibited by the

appellant upon admission to Changi Prison Hospital, the appellant was a moderate drug

addict. A moderate drug addict would consume between 0.1 gram to 0.27 gram of diamorphine

a day, while a severe addict would consume between 0.28 gram to 0.67 gram of diamorphine a

day. However, it would not be necessary for an addict to consume such an amount on a daily

basis because the 'high' from one session of drug-taking would last the addict a day or

two. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>The defence</strong> </p>
<p xmlns="">7 The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He attempted to rebut the

incriminating portions of his long statement by alleging that he had either been "not

sober" during the recording sessions, or that he had not appreciated the

ramifications of what he had said until it was read out at the trial. The appellant also

claimed that he had not mentioned the consumption defence in his s 122(6) statement as he

was feeling cold and in a hurry to get the recording of it over with. </p>
<p xmlns="">8 Instead, the appellant based his defence on two claims. The first claim was that all

the substance seized was intended for his own consumption as he was a severe heroin addict

who consumed approximately 20 grams of impure substance a day. Moreover, he liked to buy

his heroin in big bags, sufficient for one to two months' use, as he had absconded from

drug supervision and feared arrest. Second, the appellant claimed that despite his having

told the CNB that he made approximately $800 to $1200 a month as a security guard, he had

not disclosed the additional income that he derived from the sale of VCDs. As such,

although he had not worked between 30 June 2000 and his arrest on 27 November 2000, he had

amassed $30,000 in savings with which he supported his drug habit, and did not need to

resort to drug trafficking. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>The decision below </strong></p>
<p xmlns="">9 The judicial commissioner rejected the appellant's defence for the following

reasons:- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(a) The appellant was admittedly a heroin addict, but had failed to show that the

  heroin was for his own consumption. The judicial commissioner was dissatisfied by his

  explanations for the presence of the drug trafficking paraphernalia, finding that they

  were indicative of a large-scale trafficking activity. He also disbelieved the appellant's

  claim to be such a severe addict that he required all the heroin for himself. </p>
<p>(b) The defence of consumption was not an elaborate legal defence and he would have

  expected it to be raised in the s 122(6) statement but it was not. </p>
<p>(c) In the light of the length and detail of the long statement, the judicial

  commissioner could not accept that the appellant did not intend to make it, or was unaware

  that he was incriminating himself. </p>
<p>(d) The appellant's financial means were not an issue as he could have derived his

  money from drug trafficking. </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">10 The judicial commissioner hence convicted the appellant on the charge. As the amount

of diamorphine seized was in excess of 15 grams, the appellant was sentenced to death

pursuant to s 33 and the Second Schedule of the MDA. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>The appeal</strong> </p>
<p xmlns="">11 The appeal to this court rested on two contentions:- </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(a) that the judicial commissioner should not have rejected the consumption defence as

  raised by the appellant; and </p>
<p>(b) that the judicial commissioner should not have rejected the appellant's explanation

  for the presence of the drug trafficking paraphernalia found in the appellant's flat. </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><strong>The defence of consumption </strong></p>
<p xmlns="">12 The appellant claimed in his written submissions that, contrary to the findings of

fact made by the judicial commissioner, there was "ample evidence" to support

the defence of consumption. We took the view that this contention could not be supported.

The defence of consumption, as raised by the appellant, rested on a single unsubstantiated

claim: that he was a severe heroin addict who consumed approximately 20 grams of impure

substance a day, such that 687.3 grams accounted for a 34-day supply. However, the

appellant was unable to provide any evidence to show that he was indeed a severe heroin

addict. The medical reports cited by the appellant in his written submissions could not

help him, as they stated that the appellant was at worst only a mild addict, while the

prosecution was willing to accept that he was a moderate addict. </p>
<p xmlns="">13 On the other hand, the prosecution was able to adduce expert evidence, in the form

of Dr Choo's testimony, as to the degree of the appellant's addiction, which was

unchallenged by the appellant at the appeal. Based on Dr Choo's assessment, this would

leave the appellant with approximately 217 days' worth of heroin, a supply that could

conceivably have lasted the appellant for over a year. Even allowing for the appellant's

unsubstantiated claim that he bought his heroin in amounts sufficient for one to two

months' use, this could not explain the extremely large amount of heroin seized from the

appellant. </p>
<p xmlns="">14 The figures provided by Dr Choo on the rate of consumption of a severe heroin addict

also meant that even if we accepted that the appellant was a severe addict, we could

nevertheless not accept his claim of consuming 20 grams of impure substance a day. As was

pointed out by the prosecution in the trial below, the purity of the seized heroin meant

that 20 grams of substance would yield approximately 1.71 grams of diamorphine, a figure

which is over two-and-a-half times the upper limit of a severe addict's rate of

consumption. </p>
<p xmlns="">15 It is clear from cases such as Lim Ah Poh v PP <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6012&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 713</a> and PP v Hla Win

<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9271&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 2 SLR 424</a> that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact made by a trial

judge unless they are clearly reached against the weight of evidence. In light of the

foregoing, we took the view that the judicial commissioner had been entirely correct to

reject the consumption defence. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>The drug-trafficking paraphernalia </strong></p>
<p xmlns="">16 Drug-trafficking paraphernalia is relevant in establishing whether a person is a

drug trafficker or not - Low Kok Wai v PP <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=8100&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 1 SLR 676</a>. Moreover, it was stated in

Jusri bin Mohamed Hussain v PP <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10669&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 3 SLR 29</a> that "the more directly the item is

connected to drug trafficking, the more weighty evidence of possession by the accused of

that item is in suggesting that the drugs found in his possession were for the purpose of

trafficking." </p>
<p xmlns="">17 The items seized from the appellant's flat indubitably constituted drug-trafficking

paraphernalia. The appellant never disputed that the items belonged to him, but instead

tried to offer alternative explanations for their presence in his home. For example, the

appellant had claimed at the trial below that he had bought the electronic scale from an

unidentified old man in Sungei Road because he felt sorry for him. As in the case of the

consumption defence, we saw no reason to overturn the judicial commissioner's decision in

relation to the drug-trafficking paraphernalia. We were of the view that the appellant's

explanations were extremely far-fetched. If he was to be believed, it would have been

remarkably coincidental that he should have randomly assembled a collection of items which

just so happened, when taken together, to constitute paraphernalia commonly used by drug

traffickers. We also noted that these claims were all in strict contradiction to the

appellant's long statement, where he stated that the paraphernalia in question were used

for drug trafficking, and which the judicial commissioner had accepted as true. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Other issues</strong> </p>
<p xmlns="">18 We noted in passing that the judicial commissioner's refusal to accept the

appellant's explanations for the incriminating nature of his long statement was not

challenged before us. Mohamed Bachu Miah v PP <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6668&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 1 SLR 249</a> establishes that an accused

person may be convicted on his own confession even when it is retracted, if the court is

satisfied of its truth. The contents of the long statement were sufficient to warrant the

dismissal of the appeal. </p>
<p xmlns=""><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
<p xmlns="">19 For the reasons stated above, we found that a case of trafficking in 58.83 grams of

diamorphine had been properly made out against the appellant, and dismissed the appeal. </p>
