<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Nandakishor S/O Raj Pat Ahir
                    (“the Appellant”), was charged with an offence under
                        s 8(<em>b</em>)(ii) and punishable under
                    s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“MDA”). He claimed trial to the charge (commonly referred to as a
                    “LT-2” or Long Term 2 charge) which attracted enhanced punishment
                    as he had already been convicted under s 33A(1) of the MDA on 2 November
                    2006 on two drug consumption charges (“LT-1” or Long Term 1) as a
                    result of his drug-related antecedents. He was unrepresented and conducted his
                    own defence. The District Judge (“DJ”) convicted the Appellant on
                    the LT-2 charge and sentenced him to seven years and six months’
                    imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant filed a notice of appeal against
                    the conviction. However, in his petition of appeal, he stated that he was
                    dissatisfied with the DJ’s judgment on the ground that “the
                    sentence is unreasonable”. As these documents were filed by him before he
                    had legal representation, I shall treat the appeal as one against both
                    conviction and sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The dispute concerned how the variance of the
                    results of urine tests conducted under s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA should be calculated. I heard the parties on 16
                    May 2014. A similar issue arose in another matter (Originating Summons No 991 of
                    2013 (“<em>Zheng Jianxing v AG</em>” –
                    grounds of decision have been issued in that case at [2014] SGHC 120) that was
                    scheduled for hearing on 26 May 2014. Mr S K Kumar, the Appellant’s
                    counsel here, is also counsel for the applicant in <em>Zheng
                        Jianxing v AG.</em> I therefore reserved judgment in this appeal
                    pending the determination of <em>Zheng Jianxing v AG</em>.
                    The parties attended before me again on 26 May 2014 immediately after the
                    hearing in <em>Zheng Jianxing v AG</em>. At that hearing, I
                    dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence. I now set out the grounds
                    for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Undisputed Facts </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant was arrested on 17 July 2011 and
                    brought to Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters where he provided two bottles of
                    his urine specimen. On 18 July 2011, the bottles containing his urine specimen
                    were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA") for analysis under
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA. Mr Ong Rui Shen
                    (“Mr Ong”) and Ms Leong Huey Sze (“Ms Leong”),
                    Analysts with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of HSA, analysed the
                    Appellant’s urine specimen. On 22 August 2011, Mr Ong issued a certificate
                    pursuant to s 16 of the MDA stating that the urine sample he analysed was
                    found to contain 564 nanograms of monoacetylmorphine per ml of urine. On the
                    same day, Ms Leong also issued a certificate pursuant to s 16 of the MDA
                    stating that the urine sample she analysed was found to contain 731 nanograms of
                    monoacetylmorphine per ml of urine. Monoacetylmorphine is a specified drug
                    listed in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings of the District Judge in the Trial below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At trial, the Prosecution’s case was that
                    monoacetylmorphine was found in the Appellant’s urine specimen because he
                    had consumed diamorphine in contravention of s 8(<em>b</em>) of the MDA. The Appellant’s defence was that his urine
                    samples tested positive for monoacetylmorphine because he had consumed several
                    types of medication namely, “Dhasedyl DM” (which contains
                    Dextromethorphan), “Panaco” and “Tramadol”
                    (“the medication defence”). The Appellant also argued that the
                    variation in the amount of monoacetylmorphine that was found in each of his two
                    urine samples showed that the HSA analyses were
                        “inaccurate”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Prosecution called Dr Lui Chi Pang
                    (“Dr Lui”), a Senior Consultant Forensic Scientist with HSA, and
                    Mr Ong to give evidence on the Appellant’s urine sample analysis as well
                    as to provide expert opinion on the effects of consumption of “Dhasedyl
                    DM”, “Panaco” and “Tramadol”. Dr Lui and Mr
                    Ong testified that consumption of any or all of the three medications would not
                    have given rise to presence of monoacetylmorphine in the Appellant’s urine
                        samples.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Mr Ong testified that only the
                    consumption of diamorphine would have given rise to monoacetylmorphine being
                    found in the Appellant’s urine specimen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The
                    Appellant did not adduce any expert evidence to dispute these scientific
                    conclusions of the two HSA experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mr Ong also gave evidence that there will be
                    variations between test results as urine is a biological specimen and the
                    detection of drugs in urine requires a multiple step procedure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> He testified that in the present case, the
                    variance of the results of the urine tests was 12%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He stated that
                    this was well within the internationally accepted 20% limit for urine drug
                        analyses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The DJ held that the statutory presumption of
                    consumption under s 22 of the MDA was triggered because of the two HSA
                    certificates which stated that monoacetylmorphine was found in both of the
                    Appellant’s urine samples.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Therefore the
                    burden shifted to the Appellant to rebut the presumption that he had consumed
                    the specified drug without authorisation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The DJ accepted the evidence of the
                    HSA experts and found that the consumption of either one or a combination of the
                    three types of medication would not, as claimed by the Appellant, result in the
                    presence of monoacetylmorphine in his urine specimen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, she rejected
                    the Appellant’s medication defence, held that he had failed to rebut the
                    presumption of consumption<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and convicted him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Prosecution submitted that the Appellant
                    should be given a sentence that is higher than the mandatory minimum because he
                    had claimed trial and hence the mitigating factor of an early plea of guilt was
                    absent. Further, he had shown himself to be unremorseful by maintaining the
                    constituent facts of his medication defence in his mitigation plea.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As mentioned earlier, the DJ sentenced the
                    Appellant to seven years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of
                    the cane. The mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by the MDA for the
                    Appellant’s offence is seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of
                    the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appeal against Conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Appellant’s only contention on
                    appeal was that the formula used to calculate the variance of the results of the
                    urine tests was incorrect. He contended that if the correct formula had been
                    used, it would have shown that the variance was 26%. He submitted that the
                    Prosecution could not rely on the results of the urine tests since the variance
                    was beyond the internationally accepted 20% limit. Without the urine test
                    results, the presumption of consumption in s 22 of the MDA was not
                    triggered and therefore he should be acquitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In order for the Appellant to succeed in
                    having his conviction set aside, he has to show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the variance of the results of the
                        urine tests was 26%; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the prosecution cannot rely on the results of urine tests
                        where the variance is higher than 20% for the purpose of triggering the
                        presumption of consumption in s 22 of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The method of calculating the variance of the
                    results of the urine tests submitted by the Appellant is as follows (see paras 6
                    and 7 of his written submissions dated 15 May 2014):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    Our calculations are as follows:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First the average of the readings is</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">564 + 731 = 1295 ÷ 2 = 647.5</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second we take the first reading of 564 and divide it with the
                        average</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">564 ÷ 647.5 = 0.87</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Third we take the 2nd reading of 731 ÷ 647.5 = 1.13
                        (corrected to the nearest decimal point)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fourthly the difference 1.13 - 0.87 = 0.26 x 100 = 26%.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    This, in our humble submission, correctly reflects
                            the average of the results which is the mean average. A simple
                            understanding of the average mean is to add up all the numbers and
                            divide by how many numbers there are.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Appellant did not produce any scientific
                    authority to explain how he had arrived at this method of calculating the
                    variance. Instead, he submitted that this method “has been tested in
                    previous cases and one such case before Your Honour is Tan Yong Beng’s
                    case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan
                        Yong Beng</em> (DAC 14343/96; unreported judgment dated 27 January
                    1997) (<em>“Tan Yong Beng</em>”), Dr Lee Tong
                    Kooi (“Dr Lee”), who was then the Head of the Narcotics
                    Laboratory, Department of Scientific Services (“DSS”), testified
                    that the variance of the results of the urine tests in that case was 39%. In
                        <em>Tan Yong Beng</em>, District Judge S Thyagarajan
                    stated at [4] that the urine sample tested by one DSS officer was found to
                    contain 500.4 micrograms of morphine per 5 ml of urine and that the other sample
                    tested by another DSS officer was found to contain 739.8 micrograms of morphine
                    per 5 ml of urine. Based on the concentration levels of morphine found in the
                    two urine analyses, the Appellant’s method of calculating the variance
                    would yield the approximately 39% variance that was put forward by Dr
                    Lee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     However, <em>Tan Yong
                        Beng</em> offers no guidance on how Dr Lee arrived at his conclusion
                    that the variance was 39%. District Judge S Thyagarajan summarised the evidence
                    of Dr Lee at [5] of his grounds of decision. I reproduce this paragraph in its
                    entirety to highlight that the evidence that was led at trial related
                    predominantly to the causes of the high variance and not how that variance was
                    calculated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dr Lee Tong Kooi, the Head of the Narcotics Laboratory, Department of
                        Scientific Services, testified for the Prosecution. With reference to the
                        different concentrations of morphine in the two urine specimens taken from
                        the accused he said that there was a 39% variation and that it was outside
                        the acceptable range. According to him 10% to 20% variation is acceptable as
                        normal assuming everything else was equal. He explained that 10% to 20%
                        variation is allowed because of experimental or biological factors. When
                        asked to explain the 39% difference in the present case he said that one
                        possible factor would be the time of collection of the urine specimens. If
                        they were collected at different times different concentrations can result.
                        Another factor will be the presence of water in the bottles if they had been
                        washed but not drained after the wash. Water can dilute the urine specimens
                        and yield different results. He also said that if excess water from the
                        bottles had been drained off after washing but the bottles were not dried
                        the concentration of morphine should not differ. He testified that under the
                        Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations 1990 there was
                        provision for washing the bottles but there was no provision for wiping them
                        dry with a cloth after they had been washed. To the question asked by the
                        Defence Counsel whether any impurity in the cloth or rag that was used to
                        dry the bottles could contribute to the presence of morphine as well as the
                        difference in its concentration in the specimens Dr Lee answered that if the
                        cloth contained morphine and it was used to wipe the bottle it is possible
                        that some of the contents of the cloth would be transferred to the bottle.
                        He went on to say that the concentration of morphine that was being measured
                        was a very small quantity because the concentration was in micrograms. One
                        microgram he said would be the same as 10<sup>6</sup> grams
                        or 0.000001 grams. If the cloth had in fact been used to wipe urine that
                        contained a high concentration of morphine or if the cloth contained heroin
                        powder, the kind of concentrations reported in the present case by Dr Lau
                        Ching Ong and Ann Young would be possible. Dr Lee’s answers to the
                        following questions by Counsel are also significant:</p>

                            don’t know what is causing the variation. The variation is outside
                            the acceptable limits.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With this evidence, District Judge S
                    Thyagarajan held that the variance of 39% in the urine specimens was
                    “almost double what it should be”. He noted that Dr Lee had
                    acknowledged the possibility of contamination of the contents of the bottles by
                    the rag or cloth that was used to wipe the bottles. He ruled that the
                    presumption in s 22 MDA did not arise if the urine tests were unreliable.
                    Accordingly, he acquitted the accused in that case without calling upon his
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In <em>Tan Yong
                    Beng</em>, Dr Lee did not explain the method he used to calculate the
                    variance. Apparently, it was calculated in the way suggested by the Appellant in
                    the present case (see [12] above). However, this would contradict the scientific
                    literature and practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Prosecution produced the Forensic
                    Toxicology Laboratory Guidelines – 2006 (published by the Society of
                    Forensic Toxicologists and the Toxicology Section of the American Academy of
                    Forensic Sciences) (“Forensic Toxicology Laboratory Guidelines”)
                    and referred to para 8.3.9 of the said guidelines which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is recognized that for a variety of reasons occasional analytical
                        results will be outliers; that is, analytical values which deviate
                        significantly and spuriously from the true value. “Outlier”
                        results of control, blanks or calibrators should be obvious. However outlier
                        results of case specimens may not be identified if only run singly, unless
                        that result can be compared with one from a separate analytical
                        determination. For this reason replicate extraction and quantitative
                        analysis, at least in duplicate, is recommended. The laboratory should
                        determine the acceptable criteria for replicate analysis. A maximum
                        deviation of ±20% of the mean is recommended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     This explains why two separate tests on urine
                    specimens are done and that the variance of the results of the urine tests
                    refers to <em>each</em> test result’s deviation from
                    the mean of all the results obtained, calculated as a percentage of the mean
                    (see also <em>Zheng Jianxing v AG</em> at [17] and [18] of
                    the grounds of decision there for an example of how the computation is done).
                    The Prosecution submitted that the correct method of calculating the variance
                    should be as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Step 1: Obtain the mean (or average) of the results of the
                            urine tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Step 2: Calculate the value by which each test result
                            deviates from the mean.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Step 3: Divide the value obtained in Step 2 by the mean
                            and multiply it by 100%. This is the percentage of
                        variance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>In my view, this accords with the scientific literature
                            and with logic and is the correct method. The method espoused by the
                            Appellant (at [12] above) adds both test results’ deviation from
                            the mean together. This amounts to double-counting which is incorrect.
                            It is also interesting to note that Mr S K Kumar in <em>Zheng Jianxing v AG</em> adopted the method put forward by
                            the Prosecution in this case. His response to this contradiction in
                            approach was that it was not clear which method of computation was the
                            correct one since Dr Lee, the then Head of the Narcotics Laboratory, did
                            not challenge the calculation of the variance at 39% in <em>Tan Yong Beng.</em> He also submitted that the
                            Prosecution had not cited any authority to show that its method is the
                            only method or is the superior one. However, I reiterate that the method
                            apparently used in <em>Tan Yong Beng</em> and which
                            is relied upon by the Appellant here is incorrect as both deviations
                            from the mean are added together.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Applying this formula to the results of the
                    urine tests in the present case, the variance of each result is nearly 12.9%.
                    This is within the range considered to be acceptable by the Forensic Toxicology
                    Laboratory Guidelines. The Appellant’s only ground of appeal against
                    conviction was predicated on his contention that the variance was higher than
                    20%. For the reasons canvassed above, this contention was obviously erroneous. I
                    therefore dismissed his appeal against conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In respect of the second issue mentioned in
                    [11](b) above, whether the prosecution can invoke s 22 MDA by relying on the
                    results of urine tests where the variance from the mean is more than 20%, I
                    repeat my opinion expressed in [32] of <em>Zheng
                        Jianxing</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appeal against Sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Court of Appeal stated in <em>Public Prosecutor v Kwong Kok Hing</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684
                    at [13] – [16] that sentencing is a complex discretionary process and an
                    appellate court should only interfere with a sentence meted out by the trial
                    judge where it is satisfied that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     the trial judge had made the wrong
                        decision as to the proper factual matrix for sentence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     the trial judge had erred in
                        appreciating the material before him;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     the sentence was wrong in principle;
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     the sentence
                        imposed was manifestly excessive, or manifestly
                inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the present case, the Appellant did not
                    make any written submissions concerning the sentence. Mr S K Kumar submitted
                    orally that the minimum sentence provided in the MDA was “already very
                    harsh” and that the Appellant was merely putting forward the medication
                    defence at the trial. The Prosecution responded by saying that the Appellant
                    raised no mitigation before the DJ and remained unremorseful even after his
                    conviction. He was also a recalcitrant drug offender since 1994 when he was
                    about 22 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In my view, with the Appellant’s
                    drug-related antecedents dating back to 1994 (when he was convicted by a
                    military court) and in the absence of mitigating factors in his favour, it can
                    hardly be said that an imprisonment term of six months above the mandatory
                    minimum sentence prescribed by the MDA is manifestly excessive. As there were no
                    grounds to interfere with the sentence meted out by the DJ, I dismissed the
                    appeal against sentence as well.</p>
