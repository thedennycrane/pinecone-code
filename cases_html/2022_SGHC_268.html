In particular, the Liquidator argues that a writ having been filed against the Auditors does not bar the grant of the application, and that the present application is neither oppressive nor an abuse of process. The Liquidator further contends that PRC law does not prohibit the Auditors from disclosing the Documents. Four points are made. One, PRC law does not apply to the Documents; two, the Documents are unlikely to contain any Chinese state secrets; three, the Auditors are not restricted by PRC law from disclosing the Documents; and four, the Auditors may have overstated the penalties that may be imposed if the Documents are disclosed.

Additionally, the words “any person” contained in s 285 were wide enough to extend to the examinee in that case, who was resident in Malaysia (at [13]). The court was thus not prepared to find that s 285 of the CA is limited territorially to Singapore (at [22]). The extra-territorial effect of s 285 was also tacitly considered in <span class="font-italic">BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd v Celestial Nutrifoods Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 331 (“<span class="font-italic">Celestial (HC)</span>”). There, the liquidator’s application involved three individuals in the PRC who were legal representatives of the company’s subsidiaries. These persons did not appear at the hearing and the court granted the orders against them (at [3]). However, the issue was not fully argued in <span class="font-italic">Celestial (HC)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The determination of the issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I am satisfied that the provision operates extra-territorially. While reliance was placed on the English authorities indicating that s 236 of the IA lacked such effect as well as the general presumption against extra-territoriality, the better view is that the provision does allow orders to be made in respect of overseas persons and documents.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Firstly, I have not been persuaded by the approach taken in the English cases starting with <span class="font-italic">Re Tucker </span>that have found s 236 of the IA to lack extra-territorial effect<span class="font-italic">.</span> <span class="font-italic">Re Tucker</span> is not persuasive. Section 25(6) of the BA was taken in that case as lacking extra-territorial effect (at 158H). There is, however, no equivalent of s 25(6) of the BA (or s 237(3) of the IA) in the CA. Moreover, the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Re Tucker </span>was primarily concerned with the difficulty of summoning a person abroad to appear before an English court to be examined on oath. Such a concern would not arise to an application seeking only the production of documents, as in the present case. Neither <span class="font-italic">Re MF Global </span>nor <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Akkurate </span>added more in terms of principle to the position against extra-territorial effect; these cases were decided in the way they were due to the doctrine of precedent. Both found themselves bound by <span class="font-italic">Re Tucker</span>. <span class="font-italic">Re Tucker</span>, however, is not binding on this court. Both <span class="font-italic">Re Akkurate </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re MF Global</span>, in fact, noted in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that in the absence of authority, which is understood to be <span class="font-italic">Re Tucker</span>, there would be good reason s 236 to have extra-territorial effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Secondly, the presumption against extra-territoriality is displaced. The presumption against extra-territoriality was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”). Under the presumption, a statute is to only apply to activities in Singapore if it is silent on its geographical scope. It may be displaced if there is clear indication of Parliamentary intention that the statute should apply extra-territorially. The intention need not be stated expressly. On the face of it, the presumption of territoriality applies to s 285. It is silent on its geographical scope as compared to, for instance, s 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed), which was cited in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [103] and which applies in respect of Singapore citizens “outside as well as within Singapore”. It is, however, notable that the language of s 285 does not restrict its operation in any way. Section 285 is couched in sufficiently wide terms to cover a person or entity based in a foreign jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The strength of the presumption is not immutable. As observed by Tay Yong Kwang J in <span class="font-italic">Huang Danmin v Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1108 (“<span class="font-italic">Huang Danmin</span>”), it would be “more accurate to speak of degrees of extra-territoriality than to think of extra-territoriality as a discrete category” (at [20]). In determining the strength of the presumption, this would depend on the extent to which the extra-territorial effect is claimed (at [20]). A similar observation was made by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Burgundy Global Exploration Corp v Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd and another appeal </span>[2014] 3 SLR 381 (“<span class="font-italic">Burgundy Global</span>”). In responding to the observations of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Masri v Consolidated Contractors International (UK) Ltd (No 4) </span>[2010] 1 AC 90<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the presence of public interest was an appropriate basis to determine which laws should have extra-territorial effect, the Court of Appeal noted that while all penal statutes implicate public interests, the “presumption against extra-territoriality applies with particular force to criminal law” (at [91]). There are gradations in the strength of the presumption, albeit that it should not be based on the presence (or lack thereof) of public interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Here, the statute is said to operate extra-territorially because the documents come from an entity based overseas, as observed at [19] above. This is in contrast to an application for the attendance of a person abroad, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Re Tucker</span>. The distinction between the two types of orders was noted in <span class="font-italic">Re Carna Meats</span> at [49], where it was noted that the presumption of territoriality would presumably be stronger in respect of applications requiring attendance before the court. The application here is also not made in the context of criminal proceedings, where the presumption ought to apply with extra force, as observed in <span class="font-italic">Burgundy Global</span>: the criminal law jurisdiction of the court is after all the epitome of territorial power. The strength of the presumption is thus not that strong.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In determining whether the presumption is rebutted, it is not enough to show, as Mazars HK asserts, that there is nothing in the parliamentary material to suggest that s 285 of the CA is to apply extra-territorially. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Burgundy Global</span>, which was similarly concerned with the presumption against extra-territoriality, the fact that “the rule-maker did not consider whether a rule would apply in a particular situation (even though the language of the rule might be wide enough to cover that situation) does not, without more, supply a basis for excluding it from the ambit of the rule” (at [90]). Instead, the “proper approach is to consider the object of the rule and then decide whether its object would be promoted if it were interpreted to cover the situation at hand” (at [90]). This is consistent with the approach outlined at [102] of <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The purpose of s 285 shows that it is meant to operate extra-territorially. Section 285 serves a “wider purpose in enabling liquidators to get documents and/or information for the purpose of determining the reasons for the company’s demise”: <span class="font-italic">Celestial (CA</span><span class="font-italic">)</span> at [34]. The Court of Appeal observed that the scope of s 285 should be cast expansively, such that the power should be “invoked to assist in the accumulation of facts, information and knowledge that would enable or facilitate a liquidator to better discharge his statutory function” (at [42]). Section 285 therefore is intended to assist the liquidator in determining the events that led to a company’s demise and to take steps to maximise returns to the company’s creditors (at [1] of <span class="font-italic">Celestial (CA)</span>). That objective of s 285 of the CA would be served through extra-territorial application. It is doubtful that in this day and age, where commercial transactions are often international in nature, extra-territoriality must be stated expressly in all contexts. Groups of companies will span across borders, and listings, as is the case here, often involve foreign businesses and entities. The global nature of commerce, the presence of listed entities from overseas, and even data storage practices mean that information is often located elsewhere. Limiting the operation of s 285 to material and persons within the territory will hamper the proper operation of liquidation, whereby a liquidator’s investigation into a company would be easily thwarted by the person removing himself from the jurisdiction. It is telling as well that in <span class="font-italic">Re Akkurate</span>, Sir Geoffrey Vos C acknowledged that there were “compelling reasons for thinking that section 236 ought, in the contemporary commercial environment, to have extraterritorial effect” (at [52]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Re Carna Meats</span>, Mr Adam Johnson QC (sitting as a deputy High Court judge) noted that “[i]n the modern world of cross-border business practices, it is natural to construe [s 236(3) of the IA] as extending to any of the categories of person identified, whether within or outside the jurisdiction” (at [54(iii)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The counterarguments against extra-territorial application, namely the need for comity, and the requirements of enforcement, do not have any traction.

</div>
</div>
</div> In both <span class="font-italic">Thye Nam Loong</span> and <span class="font-italic">Celestial (HC)</span>, orders with extra-territorial effect were made, as elaborated at [27] above, without any apparent calamity. Additionally, as noted by Tay J in <span class="font-italic">Huang Danmin</span>, there are “different degrees of extra-territoriality and correspondingly varying degrees of problems with enforcement and comity issues” (at [27]). Mazars HK compares the present situation to that of <span class="font-italic">Huang Danmin</span>, where the mode of enforcement under the relevant statute could be effected unilaterally. <span class="font-italic">Huang Danmin</span>, however, is not an appropriate comparison. There, the issue was whether a penalty that was to be imposed on the party who had infringed the statute may be imposed effectively (at [27]). As for comity, Mazars HK highlights that s 285(5) of the CA empowers the court to cause a person to be apprehended and brought before the court for examination. This, however, is not the present situation. The Liquidator does not seek such an order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Finally, the local case law is clear that the provision does indeed operate extra-territorially, as observed in <span class="font-italic">Thye </span><span class="font-italic">Nam Loong </span>and <span class="font-italic">Celestial (HC) </span>at [27] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is further argued by Mazars HK, if s 285 of the CA has extra-territorial effect, that there should be some clear connection to Singapore before an extra-territorial order is made. In my view, the fact of the matter is that the liquidation and the potential litigation being in Singapore is enough to establish a connection and basis for the court to exercise its powers under s 285. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the order under s 285 of the CA should be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Before an order under s 285 can be granted, the court should be satisfied that the documents were reasonably required and if there is a reasonable belief that they could be provided by the auditors, and that the balance of interest lies in favour of such an order.

Broadly, Mazars SG claims to have already explained the basis of the audit and to have provided some of the Documents.

</div> The fact that ACRA has not taken any action against Mazars SG is, in itself, not an indication of Mazars SG’s liability (or lack thereof) <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Company. The concerns of the Liquidator are distinct from that of ACRA. As for the contesting claims between Mazars SG and the Liquidator concerning the adequacy of documents, it is apposite to note the observation in <span class="font-italic">Celestial (CA)</span> that there is a “general predisposition in favour of the liquidator’s views” (at [43(a)]). Even though Mazars SG has provided an explanation of how the audit was conducted and provided some of the Documents, the Liquidator remains entitled to test these claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41  Additionally, Mazars SG claims that it is not responsible for the various discrepancies in the Audit Reports. This is irrelevant at this juncture.

The Auditors rely on two key grounds. First, the application is unnecessary. The Liquidator has enough documents in hand as evidenced by the filing of the writ (see [8] above). Second, the disclosure of the Documents would result in the contravention of PRC law and expose the Auditors to a real risk of sanctions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Oppression is not established through either the application being unnecessary or the Auditors’ possible contravention of PRC Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether the application was unnecessary</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Mazars HK argues that the application was unnecessary as the Liquidator has enough documents in hand and has formed a view concerning the misconduct of the Auditors, as evidenced by the litigation funding obtained and the filing of the writ in Suit 1036.

</div> I am satisfied that the Documents remain reasonably required. Just because the Liquidator had obtained funding and filed the writ did not mean that he has everything required to pursue the claims. It is entirely consistent and reasonable to do both, on a preliminary understanding of the facts, especially in order to preserve the liquidated company’s position. The present situation is different from that in <span class="font-italic">Re Sasea Finance</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd (in liq) </span>[1998] Ch 103, a case Mazars HK relies on, in which the English court denied an application by liquidators of a company for interrogatories. A crucial reason was that the interrogatories, which comprised 100 questions, were clearly for the purpose of extracting damaging admissions for use in the prospective suit by the liquidators (at 113D).

</div> Hong Kong is a separate legal jurisdiction and while part of the PRC, is not within the territory of mainland China. Moreover, as the Liquidator highlights, Article 10 of Regulation 29 suggests that Regulation 29 does not apply to the Company. Article 10 states that “overseas listed companies shall refer to domestic companies limited by shares that issue foreign shares listed overseas”. The Company is not such an entity; it was incorporated in Singapore and is not a domestic company with an overseas listing.

</div> It is a report of what the MOF had allegedly informed Mazars SG’s Chinese lawyers. It is not a formal communication from the MOF indicating that the Documents may contain state secrets. Mazars SG is not even able to produce the communications with the MOF because they were conducted verbally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Turning finally to the Interim Provisions, I accept and prefer the Auditors’ expert opinions over that of the Liquidator as to the scope of application of the Interim Provisions. The Auditors’ experts have shown that the Interim Provisions would cover businesses listed outside the PRC. This was stated in the MOF’s official press briefing detailing the scope of the Interim Provisions. Specifically, foreign entities registered outside of China with operations and administrative institutions predominantly located in mainland China, such as the Company, would be governed by the Interim Provisions.

</div> In so far as the Auditors wish to rely on Article 5 of the Interim Provisions, it is their burden to demonstrate that the audit working papers were generated in mainland PRC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In any event, taking the Auditors’ case at its highest that the disclosure would result in the contravention of the Interim Provisions, it has to be shown that oppression would result. The consequences of contravention have to be examined to see whether oppression is sufficiently made out, and if it outweighs the interest of ensuring that the liquidator is able to discharge his statutory functions. The second stage of the test in <span class="font-italic">Celestial (CA)</span> involves a balancing exercise. It would not be decided alone by the possible contravention of a law. Here, the Auditors have not shown the consequences of such a contravention. As observed, it is similarly not clear that state secrets are contained in the Documents, particularly given the reticence of the PRC authorities when queried by the lawyers acting for Mazars SG. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No other reason to bar the application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 No other issues would bar the granting of the application. The scope of the documents asked for, which broadly relates to all documents received by the Auditors in connection with or for the purposes of the Audit Reports, was not beyond what was reasonably required. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Celestial (CA)</span>, it is not uncommon for courts to grant orders requiring parties to disclose all documents in their possession, custody or control relating to the insolvent company in question (at [67]). This was the case in <span class="font-italic">Celestial (</span><span class="font-italic">CA)</span>. In this regard, Mazars SG’s complaint that it does not possess all the documents sought falls away. The Liquidator seeks what is in their custody, power or control. What they do not have is to be attested to by way of affidavit. It is not a bar to the grant of the application. No abuse of process is made out either. The application was not sought to gain undue advantages in the litigation process, as observed at [45] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The orders sought are accordingly granted.
