</div>
</div> In June and July 2017, Revitech served statutory demands on HPK for an outstanding sum principally relating to Suit 36, which by then amounted to some $1.619 million. As HPK failed to pay, Revitech commenced winding up proceedings in October 2017. The winding up order was made on 27 October 2017 and Don Ho was appointed HPK’s liquidator (“the Liquidator”). Thus far, Revitech is the only creditor who has filed a proof of debt.

The Liquidator was not given supporting documents or information at the material time to substantiate the amount and identify the Related Parties. The Defendants admitted that the $3.59m Sum was due from Related Parties and they were Wee Poh Construction Co Pte Ltd (“Wee Poh”), Revitech, and one Subramaniam (collectively “the Three Persons”).

At that time, D1 was also very caught up with the litigation in Suit 36 and he neglected the proper running of HPK.

D1 claimed that he had provided the best explanation possible in the SOAs and he remained ready, able and willing to assist the Liquidator and to file any further SOA. D1 claimed that whilst the $3.59m Sum was “justly due” to HPK, he had attempted to claim the sum from the Related Parties (who were the Three Persons) but they refused to pay.

For completeness, my reasons also applied to D2, who had the opportunity to refute the allegations in the Stated Paragraphs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As for the Proposed Amendment, the court has a wide discretion to allow pleadings to be amended at any stage of the proceedings, including at trial, after judgment, or on appeal. There are two primary considerations in deciding whether to allow an amendment, namely, whether the amendment sought would enable the real question or issue in controversy between the parties to be determined, thereby ensuring the ends of substantive justice are met; and that procedural fairness to the opposing party is maintained: <span class="font-italic">Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 524 at [117].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I allowed the Proposed Amendment to enable the real issues to be determined. The matters relating to the Proposed Amendment were not new. The Liquidator in his pleadings and evidence had set out the matters which he intended to rely on for his claim against the Defendants for not acting with reasonable diligence as directors of HPK, and he did not seek to introduce new evidence. The cause of action remained that of breach of directors’ duties, although the Proposed Amendment sought to plead a particular duty to use reasonable diligence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The crux of the Liquidator’s claim for breach of duties as directors is that the Defendants should have pursued the Related Parties to recover the debts owing to HPK, particularly in light of the dispute between HPK and Revitech that resulted in a judgment overall in Revitech’s favour. The Liquidator had already pleaded that the Defendants had failed to keep proper records of HPK and refused to provide the identities of and the amounts owing by the Related Parties. The Defendants had something to hide and had impeded the Liquidator’s recovery efforts from the Related Parties in the interests of HPK’s creditors.

The 2012 Financial Statement showed an “amount owing from related parties” to HPK of the $3.59m Sum as at 31 August 2012. Based on HPK’s Balance Sheet as at August 2012 (“2012 Balance Sheet”), the Related Parties were HTS (who owes HPK $3,500,074.29) and IH (who owes HPK $90,513.51) as they share common shareholding and directors with HPK.

</div> The payment vouchers were clear in their purport, which was to pay HPK for the project. Also, it would be strange for HPK to borrow money from IH to pay workers’ levy and CPF in 10 separate transactions which occurred very close in time between 14 November and 24 December 2007. Further, it is unclear how the workers’ levy and CPF alone amounted to a substantial sum of $327,000. D1 was unable to explain this, first maintaining it was for workers’ levy and CPF, then rather incomprehensibly explained that some of the “loan” was to “give the subcontractor money … to solve all the problem”, and that HPK “[owed] other people money”, then said that it was also used to pay “the previous subcontractor of Revitech”.

I find that D2, being involved in HPK, knew who the Related Parties were, knew about the projects that HPK was involved in particularly with the Related Parties, knew that moneys were owed by them to HPK, and would have been privy to the decisions made by D1 including the decision not to collect the $3.59m Sum (see also [85]–[89] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In any event, s 157C(2) provides that s 157C(1) applies to a director only if he: (a) acts in good faith; (b) makes proper inquiry where the need for inquiry is indicated by the circumstances; and (c) has no knowledge that such reliance is unwarranted. Mr Wong submits that D2 acted in good faith and that there was no reason for him to doubt D1 as “[D1’s] track record with managing [HPK] had been a good one” and “there is no evidence that there was anything untoward which should have put [D2] on inquiry”. There was also nothing more that D2 could have done to collect the $3.59m Sum and there would have been no difference even if he had taken steps to make inquiries because he did not have “control over the other [party]” – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>D1 – “to comply”.

The Defendants had a duty to consider the interests of HPK’s creditor, Revitech, to ensure that HPK’s assets are not dissipated or exploited for their own benefit to the prejudice of Revitech’s interest, and they had breached that duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The evidence showed that the Defendants did not merely neglect to consider Revitech’s interest, but deliberately refused to collect the $3.59m Sum from the Related Parties (HTS and IH) to keep it from Revitech. Shortly after the net judgment in Suit 36 was given in Revitech’s favour in 2013, the Defendants stopped filing financial statements for HPK (the last financial statement being the 2012 Financial Statement) and preparing HPK’s accounts from 2013, and decided to cease business activity and report HPK’s dormancy to ACRA (see [64] and [65] above). That the Defendants chose to suddenly make HPK “dormant” after Revitech was awarded a substantial sum of damages against HPK leads to the inference that they intended to frustrate Revitech from recovering the judgment sum in Suit 36; especially when they knew that HPK had assets in the form of the $3.59m Sum which it had not collected or pursued against HTS and IH.

</div>
</div> It was thus clear that in 2013 (particularly after the court decision in Revitech’s favour), the Defendants decided not to pursue the $3.59m Sum from the Related Parties to Revitech’s prejudice. I find D2 was privy to this. Indeed, whilst claiming that HPK was no longer operating and had ceased all activities since 2006, the directors continued to draw salaries until 2012, whilst letting the debts owed by the Related Parties remain uncollected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I reiterate that I had rejected D2’s defence that he was a silent partner or “sleeping” director of HPK and did not know that HPK owed money to the Related Parties. I find this defence does not assist D2. The case of <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sukamto Sia and another and another appeal</span> [2014] 3 SLR 277 is instructive. Sia, one of two directors of the company, Dynasty, pledged shares acquired by Dynasty (which had not been fully paid for) to various banks as security for loan facilities granted to him and his related parties (“Security Transactions”). The shares were Dynasty’s only assets. Lee, the other director, had signed documents relating to the pledge of about 40.7% of the shares. When the loans under the Security Transactions were defaulted on, the banks sold the shares to satisfy the debt. Dynasty was wound up and the liquidators sued Sia and Lee for breach of fiduciary duties to Dynasty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Court found that Sia had breached his fiduciary duty by wholly disregarding the interests of Dynasty’s creditors as the Security Transactions imperilled Dynasty’s solvency, yet Sia still pledged the shares as collateral for loans to himself and his related parties to the prejudice of Dynasty’s creditors.  Lee claimed that he did not know that Dynasty had creditors; he was entitled to assume that the shares had been fully paid for; he did not know of the share pledges; and he signed the pledge documents on Sia’s request. The Court rejected that Lee was “completely ignorant” of Dynasty’s affairs as he was an experienced businessman who had been involved in the management of public listed companies and had a 20% share in Dynasty’s profits. It was thus unlikely that Lee had refrained from making any enquires about the value of the shares. Pertinently, Lee’s absence of knowledge of Dynasty’s insolvency was not a defence to his duties to make due inquiry and establish Dynasty’s financial health, and it was incumbent upon Lee to know what assets and liabilities it had. The Court further found that Lee must have been aware of the nature of the pledge documents that he had signed, and would at that point have made the necessary inquiries that would have led him to know that Dynasty was pledging a significant portion of the shares as security for a loan facility to Sia. In signing the pledge documents, the Court found Lee in breach of his fiduciary duties to Dynasty for the same reasons that Sia was liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In the present case, D2 had signed the 2012 Financial Statement. It is immediately apparent from that statement that the $3.59m Sum was HPK’s only “current assets” and formed the bulk of its “total assets” (of $3,629,332). Hence, it is unbelievable that D2 had signed the 2012 Financial Statement blindly without making any enquiries about what the “amount owing from related parties” was. I had disbelieved D2 that he did not know that there was anyone who owed money to HPK. He was a 25% shareholder in HPK; he knew that HPK was involved in many construction projects; he signed the Daisy Avenue LOA and Rosyth LOA; he was aware that HPK was the main contractor for the Braddell and Daisy Avenue Projects; and he admitted that HPK’s accountants would provide and explain HPK’s accounts to him albeit briefly (see [40(b)], [54] and [55] above). It was equally unbelievable that D2 was unaware of the outcome of Suit 36, and the judgment debt which HPK owed to Revitech. The entirety of the proceedings in Suit 36 took place over seven years (from 2006 to 2013) and D2 attested that he knew of Suit 36 even in 2007. Indeed, D2’s premise that he was a “sleeping” director was also that he had “retired” in about 2002; but the evidence showed that he was still active in HPK and drawing a salary for many years after his purported retirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In any event, there were many occasions when D2 could have made enquiries that would have led him to discover HPK’s parlous financial position and its failure to collect the $3.59m Sum from the Related Parties. It bears reiterating that D2 was involved in HPK, HTS and IH, he was a director of HPK since its incorporation and a shareholder, and he was also a shareholder and director of HTS and IH. He thus had a direct interest in all three entities. It is thus unbelievable that D2 remained consistently ignorant of HPK’s parlous financial position and HPK’s failure to collect the $3.59m Sum. Instead, I find that D2 knew that the Related Parties were HTS and IH and he was equally privy to the decision not to collect the $3.59m Sum from them to the prejudice of HPK and its creditor, Revitech. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As such, I am satisfied that the Defendants breached their fiduciary duty to consider the interests of HPK’s creditors, by failing to pursue the $3.59m Sum to the prejudice of the interests of HPK’s creditor, Revitech, when HPK was in a parlous financial situation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Duty not to put oneself in a position of conflict</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 A director also owes, as an important facet of the duty of honesty, a duty of undivided loyalty to his company: <span class="font-italic">Townsing Henry George</span><span class="font-italic"> v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 597 at [60]. This encompasses the “no-profit rule”, which proscribes the director from making a profit out of his fiduciary position, and the “no-conflict rule”, which includes two different aspects that proscribes two different types<span class="font-italic"> </span>of conflicts. The first proscribes the director from putting himself in a position where his own interests and his duty to his principal are in conflict (“no conflict of interest and duty”): <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong </span>([77] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [135]; <span class="font-italic">Nordic International Ltd v Morten Innhaug </span>[2017] 3 SLR 957 (“<span class="font-italic">Nordic International</span>”) at [53] and [54]. The second prohibits the director from acting in a situation where there is a conflict between his duties owed to more than one principal (“no conflict of duty and duty”). The no-conflict rule is strict: where a director is found to have placed himself in a position of conflict of interest, he will not be permitted to assert that his action was <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>or thought to be in the interests of the company: <span class="font-italic">Goh Chan Peng and others v Beyonics Technology Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 592 at [47]; <span class="font-italic">Nordic International</span> at [53]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I find that the Defendants have breached the no conflict of interest and duty rule. They have a direct interest in refusing to collect the $3.59m Sum from the Related Parties (of whom they are shareholders) and in refusing to assist the Liquidator in pursuing this debt from the Related Parties, because this would keep the $3.59m Sum out of Revitech’s reach such that the Related Parties, and thus the Defendants, can benefit. Yet, the Defendants owe a duty to HPK to ensure that the $3.59m Sum is pursued and collected for HPK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Indeed, <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">D1’s inconsistent explanations for not collecting the $3.59m Sum </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">eg</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">claiming that Wee Poh “refused to pay” and then claiming that he did not pursue Wee Poh </span>(see [47] above)) and <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">his</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> lies about the identities of the Related Parties, coupled with D2’s claim of ignorance of HPK’s affairs, showed the Defendants’ deliberate concealment of the Related Parties’ identities and refusal to collect the $3.59m Sum for HPK so that they could benefit. If HTS and IH had repaid the $3.59m Sum to HPK (which is then used to discharge its liabilities to its creditors such as Revitech), D1 and D2 would have lost that sum, given their interests in both the Related Parties and HPK</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Defendants also breached the no conflict of duty and duty rule by prioritising their duty as directors to IH and HTS over their duty as directors to HPK. They owed a duty to HPK to pursue the $3.59m Sum from IH and HTS. As the Defendants are also directors of IH and D1 is still a director of HTS, they (on IH’s and HTS’s behalf) would have resisted the collection of this debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Hence, I find that the Defendants had put themselves in positions of conflict by preferring the interests of IH and HTS and the Defendants’ own interests over the interests of HPK and its creditors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Duty to act with reasonable diligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 A director’s duty under s 157(1) of the CA to “use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office” encapsulates a director’s separate common law duty to exercise due care, skill and diligence: <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> ([77] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [134]; <span class="font-italic">Scintronix </span>([77] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [42]. The standard of care and diligence owed by a director “is not fixed” and is a “continuum depending on various factors” such as his role in the company, the type of decision being made, and the size and business of the company. The standard “will not be lowered to accommodate any inadequacies in the individual’s knowledge or experience”; and will instead “be raised if he held himself out to possess or in fact possesses some special knowledge or experience”: <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> at [136]. Ultimately, <span class="font-italic">all</span> directors, whether engaged in an executive or non-executive capacity, “are subject to a minimum objective standard of care which entails the obligation to take reasonable steps to place oneself in a position to guide and monitor the management of the company”: <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> at [137].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I had rejected D2’s claims that he did not know about Suit 36 until 2007 or about third party debts owed to HPK, that he was purportedly a “sleeping” director who signed documents blindly on D1’s instructions, and that he was unaware of his obligations to HPK. Even if these claims were true, D2 would still have breached his duty to exercise reasonable diligence or to exercise due care, skill and diligence. He was not a greenhorn to business or to HPK. As a director of HPK, he is subject to a minimum standard of care to take reasonable steps to monitor the management of HPK. This would entail some knowledge of HPK’s business activities and what assets and liabilities it had, even if he did not know the minute details. If D2 had taken some steps to monitor HPK’s management, it would not have gone unnoticed to him that HPK’s main asset even in 2012 was the $3.59m Sum owed by the Related Parties and which remained uncollected, especially given that D2 had signed the 2012 Financial Statement and he knew that HPK was doing construction projects such as for IH.

</div>
</div> This must also be looked at in light of the fact that D2 knew around 2007 that HPK had lost a court case against Revitech and D1 had decided to appeal against the decision in Suit 36 – yet D2 purportedly did not make any effort to find out the final outcome of that suit given that it would have affected HPK’s financial situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Hence, D2 had clearly not discharged the minimum objective standard of care required of him in monitoring the management of HPK, which standard applied to all directors including one engaged in a non-executive capacity. Even in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Ghani bin Tahir v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 4 SLR 1153 at [89] and [93] (which involved a criminal prosecution of a director of the company for failure to exercise reasonable diligence under s 157(1) of the CA), the court held that a director cannot simply be a “dummy director” who approves, ignores or is nonchalant as to whether the company is engaging in any illegal activities and the cavalier attitude adopted by the director there made it clear that “he had failed to exercise any diligence, let alone reasonable diligence” as required of him as a director.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sections 199 and 336 of the Companies Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Liquidator also pleaded that the Defendants had breached their duty to maintain proper records, accounts and books of HPK under s 199 (read with ss 338 and 339) of the CA and to deliver them to him under s 336(1) of the CA. However, these are matters which attract a criminal penalty under the CA, and do not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> give rise to a separate cause of action against the Defendants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on breach of duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In conclusion, I find that both D1 and D2 have, by failing to cause HPK to pursue the $3.59m Sum against the Related Parties especially when HPK was in a parlous financial position, breached their duties as directors of HPK.

</div>
</div> all these did not absolve him from liability. The law also does not make a distinction of the fiduciary duties that a nominee director owes to the company (<span class="font-italic">W&amp;P Piling Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Chew Yin What and others</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 218 at [80]). As stated earlier, even if D2 was merely a “sleeping” director (which I did not accept), this would not have absolved him from his duty to exercise due care, skill and diligence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 At common law the remedies available to a company for a director’s breach of duty depends on the nature of the duty breached. Not all duties which a director owes to his company are fiduciary duties. The source of all fiduciary duties is the duty of loyalty and fiduciary duties in the classic sense thus encompass the no-profit and no-conflict rules. The duty of care, skill, and diligence is not a fiduciary duty as it is not imposed to exact loyalty from a director: <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> ([77] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [135]. Breaches of fiduciary duties can be further divided into custodial and non-custodial breaches. A non-custodial breach does not involve the stewardship of assets already entrusted to the director, while a custodial breach results in the misapplication of the principal’s funds: <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping v Winsta Holding Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1199 (“<span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping</span>”) at [104]–[106].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The usual remedy for a breach of a director’s non-custodial fiduciary duty would be a compensatory monetary award such as equitable compensation. Where the fiduciary earned profits from the breach, the principal can seek, alternatively, an account of profits: <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [105]. As for a custodial breach, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping </span>(at [108]–[109]) noted that there is “good reason for the remedial principles targeting the misapplication of funds to apply to a custodial breach”, as the wrong is done to the principal’s funds placed under the fiduciary’s custody. Further, in a custodial breach of duty, there should be a causal link between the breach and the subject matter of the breach that is sought to be restored: <span class="font-italic">Sim Poh Ping</span> at [114] and [125]–[126]. Where a director breaches his duties to act honestly and use reasonable diligence under s 157(1) of the CA, he is liable to the company for “any profit made by him or for any damage suffered by the company as a result of the breach”: s 157(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In the present case, the evidence showed that the $3.59m Sum was owed by the Related Parties to HPK even as at 31 August 2012 and D1 agrees to the existence of this debt and that it has not been collected by HPK. The Defendants’ decision not to pursue the $3.59m Sum to keep this out of reach of HPK’s creditor, Revitech, effectively resulted in the dissipation of this asset to the detriment of both HPK and its creditor but to the benefit of the Related Parties and indirectly the Defendants as shareholders of the Related Parties. The Defendants’ failure to cooperate with the Liquidator (such as to provide the books of HPK and to give particulars relating to the Related Parties and the $3.59m Sum) impeded the Liquidator in carrying out his functions to recover HPK’s assets for the creditors’ benefit in the liquidation. The Liquidator attested that he was unable to form a clear picture of the existing assets and liabilities of HPK or to trace the transactions that HPK has been involved in.

</div> Indeed, the Defendants continue to hide the true identities of the Related Parties, maintaining that they are the Three Persons. This impeded the Liquidator in his pursuit of HTS and IH for the $3.59m Sum as there was insufficient evidence to enable him to make a considered claim against them (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, how the debt in the form of the $3.59m Sum is derived and in relation to what services or goods provided by HPK to HTS and IH, and when the debts accrued to HPK).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Mr Wong submits that, even if HPK had sought to collect the debts from HTS and IH, it could only have collected a maximum of $90,925.88. D2 submits that HTS’s 2013 Balance Sheet showed it only had $412.37 in cash and no fixed assets, and that it was insolvent and had net liabilities of $1.15 million. Hence, the maximum amount that HPK could have obtained from HTS was $412.37. This, coupled with the $90,513.51 owing by IH to HPK, as reflected in HPK’s 2012 Balance Sheet, would only amount to a total of $90,925.88.

</div> I reject this submission. It was neither pleaded in D2’s defence nor attested to by D2 and the plaintiff had no opportunity to respond to this. In any event, this is pure speculation. Apart from HTS’s 2013 Balance Sheet, there is no evidence to show that HTS only had $412.37 in assets or that it was indeed insolvent or what HPK could have recovered from HTS if it had pursued a claim against it. The reliability of HTS’s 2013 Balance Sheet is also doubtful as it is unclear how it was derived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Hence, I am satisfied that HPK has suffered loss equivalent to the $3.59m Sum as a result of the Defendants’ breaches of duties, and which the Defendants are liable to compensate HPK for.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Time bar</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The Defendants pleaded that HPK’s claim for the $3.59m Sum is in any event time-barred under ss 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), 6(2), 6(7) and/or 22(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“LA”), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the action cannot be brought after six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 When a limitation defence is raised by the defendant, the plaintiff has to prove that its claim falls within the limitation period. In this regard, it is insufficient for the plaintiff to show that the date of accrual of the cause of action is different from the date alleged by the defendant, and he also has to prove that the date of accrual is within the limitation period: <span class="font-italic">IPP Financial Advisers Pte Ltd v Saimee bin Jumaat and another appeal</span> [2020] SGCA 47 at [37] and [41]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 However, it is important to distinguish between a claim by HPK against its debtors (the Related Parties) for the $3.59m Sum, and a claim by HPK against its directors for breaching their duties.

</div> The Defendants’ pleaded limitation defence is thus based on a cause of action by <span class="font-italic">HPK against its debtors, namely the </span><span class="font-italic">Three Persons</span> in respect of the $3.59m Sum. In such a case, the date on which the cause of action accrued would be when the $3.59m Sum fell due from the Three Persons. But the Defendants’ pleaded defence in limitation is misconceived and a non-starter, as the Liquidator’s cause of action is against the Defendants for breach of directors’ duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The Liquidator attested that the cause of action only accrued on 29 October 2013, after the assessment of damages in Suit 36 had been completed, because this was when the Defendants would have “started to abandon [HPK’s] business and benefited the [R]elated [P]arties”. Furthermore, the Defendants’ breaches “could not have been discovered until after the winding up had been commenced”.

</div> Where the claim is one of breach of directors’ duties, the date on which the cause of action accrued would be when the breach of the duty can be said to have crystallised. This would be when the Defendants caused HPK not to pursue and collect the $3.59m Sum in disregard of HPK’s and its creditors’ interests so that the Defendants could benefit themselves and the Related Parties, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in October 2013 when it became apparent that the outcome in Suit 36 resulted in HPK owing Revitech some $1.5 million. As this Suit was commenced on 12 October 2018, it is thus not time barred. For completeness, the Defendants have not pleaded that there was a time bar in relation to the underlying debt (the $3.59m Sum) <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> IH and HTS, precisely because their defence is that the Related Parties are the Three Persons and the time-bar applied <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Three Persons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Defendants’ claims of loans to HPK</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The Defendants claimed that HPK owes them $3,132,356 for loans which they made to HPK (see [16] and [21] above) (“the Loan”). They pleaded that the Loan amount was $2,707,356, and which they “have a right to claim” from HPK “and will file their claim in due course”, and that this sum should be set off against any sums which they may be liable to HPK.

</div> It should be noted that the Defendants have not filed a counterclaim for the Loan and it is unclear if they had sought leave to do so (under s 262(3) of the CA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In any event, and whether the Loan claimed is $3,132,356 or $2,707,356, I am not satisfied that the Defendants have proved, on balance, that HPK owes them the Loan. First, whilst the 2012 Financial Statement read with the 2012 Balance Sheet would be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence that the Defendants were owed $2,707,356 in directors’ loans in 2012, they have not shown, on balance, that there was any sum due to them today and what that amount is. They have not provided any underlying documents (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>bank statements) to corroborate the Loan when they, as directors of HPK, were in a position to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Second, the Defendants’ claim for $3,132,356 is contradicted by their own evidence. D1 in his AEIC stated that HPK owed him and D2 $3,132,356 comprising $2,707,356 as due and payable to D1 and another $425,000 which D1 lent to HPK to pay Revitech’s costs in Suit 36. Then, in the 2nd SOA, he claimed that HPK owed the Defendants $840,714.10.
