</div> However, there was no reason for Khor to trust “Ah De” either, so as to rely on the assurances by “Ah De” (including assurances that he would only be dealing with “soft drugs”). There was no evidence that their relationship had been close. On Khor’s own evidence, the extent of their relationship was that they had “met a few times and had a few chats”. Moreover, prior to embarking on his fourth delivery, Khor had asked “Lao Ban” to remove “Ah De” as a middleman as Khor felt that “Ah De” was “leeching [his] earnings and taking too much from [him]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Khor said that his belief that he was carrying only “soft drugs” was also “based on [his] previous three experiences” delivering drugs for “Lao Ban”. In this connection, counsel for Khor referred me to <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 201 (“<span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span>”) which involved an appellant who denied knowledge of the nature of the drugs he had imported – a capital amount of diamorphine. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that the appellant had succeeded in rebutting the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA because there had been a consistent pattern of prior deliveries involving only controlled drugs that did not carry the sanction of capital punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 However, the specific facts and circumstances of that case were – as the Court of Appeal itself took great pains to stress – “rather unusual” and “finely balanced” (at [29]). There had been a significant number of prior deliveries that involved only Erimin, Ketamine, Ice, and Ecstasy. Further, the appellant had directly asked the drug supplier, one Tony, whether he would be carrying diamorphine as he was afraid of the death penalty, and was assured that there was no diamorphine involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The facts of the present case are quite different. There was no evidence to suggest that Khor knew with certainty that his three previous deliveries did not involve diamorphine. Unlike the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Khor Soon Lee</span>, Khor was never told what type of drugs he would be carrying into Singapore. Neither did he ask “Lao Ban” what types of drugs the bundles contained. The one occasion on which Khor had questioned “Lao Ban” on what the bundles contained was on a call with the latter <span class="font-italic">after</span> Khor had been arrested.

</div> Since Exhibit D1B was the bundle which contained the least amount of diamorphine, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not less than 18.62g, Han was charged with attempting to possess one bundle of not less than 18.62g of diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Han denied that he intended to possess the diamorphine and disputed several aspects of the Prosecution’s case as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Han had indeed placed an order with “Ah Tiong”, but the order was only for Ketamine and Ice. Han did not order diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Khor had been instructed by “Lao Ban” to deliver a <span class="font-italic">yellow</span> bundle to Han. However, there simply were no yellow bundles amongst the bundles that Khor had carried with him on 2 March 2016. Further, the bundles were all marked “Ken”. None of them bore Han’s name, or Han’s codename, “T”. All of this suggested that there had been a “mix-up” in the drug order, such that Khor was mistakenly under the impression that he was to deliver a bundle containing diamorphine to Han.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Han had made no prior arrangement to meet Khor. He had been on his way to the market to gamble when he received a call from Khor asking to meet at the ground floor of Block 5. He then went to meet Khor to collect his order of Ketamine and Ice, and to make payment of a total of $3,600 to Khor; $3,200 being payment for the order, and $400 being an outstanding sum owed to “Ah Tiong” in respect of the previous order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Having reviewed the evidence before me, I found that the weight of the evidence accorded with the narrative put forth by the Prosecution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Instructions by “Lao Ban” on the bundle for delivery to Han   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 First, I turn to the instructions given by “Lao Ban” to Khor.

Unfortunately, it appeared that neither Khor nor SI Pang (the CNB officer listening in on the conversation) realised that there were no yellow bundles amongst those seized from Khor. As a result, SI Pang did not instruct Khor to clarify what “Lao Ban” meant when he referred to “yellow” bundles, nor did Khor do so on his own initiative.

</div> If “Lao Ban” had been referring to dissimilar bundles, he would have had to specify, by description, which bundles were to go to whom. The fact that he referred to the three bundles interchangeably meant that, notwithstanding his reference to the bundles being yellow, “Lao Ban” was in fact referring to the three <span class="font-italic">black</span> bundles of similar shape and size (marked C1B, C1C and D1B) which contained the same controlled drug – diamorphine. The further reference to the bundles being “big” more explicitly differentiated them from Exhibit C1D, a black bundle which was considerably smaller and found to contain methamphetamine. Neither could “Lao Ban” have been referring to the three bundles wrapped in clear tape (being Exhibits C1E, D1C and D1D), since they were of different dimensions. Exhibit D1D (with 200 tablets of nimetazepam) was a significantly longer and narrower bundle compared to Exhibits C1E and D1C (each with 400 tablets of nimetazepam). In sum, “Lao Ban” could only have been referring to the three black bundles marked C1B, C1C and D1B.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I note that Khor’s clear understanding of the instructions, after having been shown what the bundles looked like, had also been that one of the “big black bundle” was for Han.

</div> While Khor’s subjective understanding of those instructions certainly was not conclusive on its own, it certainly fortified my conclusion that the reference to “yellow” big bundles was to the big black bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The fact that all seven bundles were labelled “Ken” did not change my view that one of the large black bundles was intended for Han.

I rejected this allegation. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was extremely unlikely that “Lao Ban” or his associates in Malaysia would have inadvertently arranged to deliver diamorphine to Han by mistake. The three bundles each contained quantities of diamorphine high enough to attract capital punishment. The value of the drugs contained therein would have been high. Given the high stakes involved in transporting such large quantities of drugs, the bundles of diamorphine would not have been given to Khor by mistake, or instructions wrongly given to Khor to deliver a bundle to Han.

Also, Exhibit C1D, the smaller bundle wrapped in black tape, contained Ice with a total weight of 49.85g, and a net weight of not less than 34.04g, and not 25g as purportedly ordered by Han. In other words, there was not a single bundle or bundles which corresponded to Han’s purported order. Again, I did not accept that there could be a mistake in the orders such that Han’s order was not given to Khor at all. After all, “Ah Tiong” had contacted Han various times concerning the delivery, after Khor had arrived in Singapore, to confirm with Han that the delivery of Han’s order would take place. I rejected Han’s contention that there had been such a “mix-up” in the drug order that a bundle of diamorphine had been earmarked for delivery to him by mistake, while his order was not with Khor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Another allegation, first made in Han’s closing submissions, was that it was one “Ah Tiao” who was the intended recipient of the bundle of diamorphine.

</div> The basis for this allegation was Han’s evidence that “Ah Tiao” had on previous occasions ordered heroin from “Ah Tiong”, and, that “Ah Tiao”, using the mobile number 83853816, had been in contact with Khor on the night of 26 February 2016, the day of Khor’s first delivery for “Ah Tiong”. I note that this point was only touched on very briefly at the trial and was not seriously pursued in Han’s written closing submissions. Counsel for Han did not cross-examine Khor on this alleged conversation with “Ah Tiao”, and so it was not established if the alleged conversation had even taken place, much less that it pertained to an order of diamorphine that “Ah Tiao” had placed with “Ah Tiong” for delivery on 2 March 2016. Even assuming that “Ah Tiao” and Khor had indeed spoken on 26 February 2016, this was, in my view, neither here nor there. There was no evidence to link the alleged conversations on 26 February 2016, the date of Khor’s first delivery, with the consignment of drugs intercepted on 2 March 2016, Khor’s fourth delivery. Furthermore, “Ah Tiong” had specifically communicated with Han various times on 2 March 2016 to arrange for the delivery. Accordingly, I rejected Han’s allegation that the bundle of diamorphine was intended for “Ah Tiao”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Purpose of the $3,600 </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Next, I turn to the bundle of $3,600 in cash which Han had on him at the time of his arrest, which was kept separately from his other possessions and cash. I found that this amount was intended as the exact payment for the bundle of diamorphine. SI Pang testified that from his experience, the market price of one pound of heroin was approximately $3,600.

In that same statement, Han recounted that his previous order had been for 500 tablets of “Erimin” and 50g of Ice, which he had spent $3,500 on.

Instead, he said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I did not see the message. I did not even know I had a message.

</div> In my view, it was clear that Han did not mention the $400 owing to “Ah Tiong” at the recording of his 9 March 2016 statement (and the earlier statements) because it was an afterthought concocted to explain why he had prepared $3,600 to pay for the drugs, when, on his case, the drugs would only have cost $3,200.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Failure to mention the order of Ketamine and Ice  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Moving on, I note that Han had failed to mention the order of Ketamine and Ice in his cautioned statement of 2 March 2016.

Despite the references to <span class="font-italic">diamorphine</span> in the charge, Han did not state his defence that he had ordered only Ketamine and Ice.

</div> However, rationale behind that presumption, as stated by the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor</span> [1979–1980] SLR(R) 710 (at [29]), remains relevant: where the quantity of the drug being transported is many times what a typical addict would be able to consume on a daily basis, the likelihood is that the drug is being transported not for personal consumption, but for the purpose of trafficking. Even where the statutory presumption does not apply to shift the burden of proving intention, the quantity of the drugs in the accused’s possession is still relevant in assessing if the Prosecution has discharged that burden. This would be especially so in situations where the quantity possessed is many times the amount that would have triggered the statutory presumption under s 17, although I should add that evidence as to that specific accused person’s rate of consumption of the drug in question would also be relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Counsel for Han confirmed that Han was not running the defence that he had ordered the diamorphine for his own consumption, since his case was that he had not been expecting diamorphine.

</div> On the facts, Khor’s role in the drug transaction was restricted to importing the diamorphine, and then delivering it to the various recipients according to the instructions of “Lao Ban”. While he was also expected to collect payments from the various recipients, these could be considered as acts incidental to the delivery of the drugs. I therefore found on a balance of probabilities that his acts fell within the acts of a courier under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the MDA. Khor was issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the PP. I saw no reason to impose the death penalty, nor did the Prosecution submit that there was any such reason.

I therefore found that Han had not proved on a balance of probabilities that he was a mere courier. The PP did not issue Han a certificate of substantive assistance.
