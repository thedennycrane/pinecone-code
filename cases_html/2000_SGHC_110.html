<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. This is an appeal from the order of an

assistant registrar made on 20 October 1999 dismissing the application of Falkland

Investments Ltd ("Falkland") (which has entered an appearance as defendant by

leave granted on 21 July 1999) for an order that the second intervener ("VBTRF")

provide security for costs. I heard the appeal on 18 February 2000 and allowed it. I made

an order for security to be provided by VBTRF in an amount of S$20,000. VBTRF has given

notice of appeal and these are my written grounds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. The plaintiffs in this action are

members of the crew of the vessel and their claims are for unpaid wages and other moneys

due to them. The action was commenced by writ issued on 18 November 1998 and the same day

the vessel was arrested. Judgment in default of appearance was entered on 15 January 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. The first intervener ("ST

Marine") claims an interest in the vessel as an unpaid repairer. ST Marine is the

plaintiff in Admiralty <i>in</i> <i>Rem</i> Suit No 854 of 1998 against the same vessel

and judgment in default of appearance was entered in that action on 12 February 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. The vessel has since been sold pursuant

to an order of court and both the plaintiffs in this action and ST Marine have been paid

out of the proceeds of sale and their judgments have been satisfied. There is a

substantial surplus and the money lies in court. The order of court for the sale of the

vessel was made on 29 December 1998 and it does not appear that any order under O 70 r

21(2) has been made but I have not been informed if there are any claims against the

owners of the vessel which are enforceable against the proceeds of sale.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. On 19 June 1999 well after the

plaintiffs had entered judgment and the vessel had been sold Falkland applied as owner of

the vessel for leave to enter an appearance as defendant. The application was opposed by

VBTRF and on 2 July 1999 an assistant registrar gave directions for affidavits to be filed

and adjourned the hearing to 20 August 1999. Falkland appealed and on 21 July 1999 the

court ordered:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"1. [Falkland] be at liberty to enter

  an appearance as defendants in this action.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. This order does not determine the issue

  as to who is the true owner of the vessel and therefore the proceeds of sale.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. [VBTRF] is to take out an application

  to enter an appearance or to intervene in this action within 3 weeks from the date hereof

  together with supporting affidavits.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4. No application for payment out of the

  balance of the proceeds of sale be taken out by [Falkland] until after 3 weeks from the

  date hereof or until further order.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">5. Costs of the appeal be reserved."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">It was pursuant to this order of court

that as noted above Falkland entered an appearance as defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. In due course (after time had been

extended for this purpose) VBTRF applied <i>ex</i> <i>parte</i> for leave to intervene in

this action. In the affidavit filed in support of its application its solicitor Mr Khoo

said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"VBTRF say that they are Owners of

  the Vessel "VIRGO I" and therefore have an interest therein. A current copy of

  an extract from the Vladivostok Registry of Ships is annexed hereto and marked as exhibit

  ‘A’ showing that the current ownership of the Vessel lies with VBTRF."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The application was granted on 18 August

1999 and VBTRF entered an appearance as intervener.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. On 27 September 1999 VBTRF applied by

motion for these orders:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"(1) the determination of the issue

  of the validity and enforceability of the purported Agreement dated 16 January 1998

  allegedly made between [Falkland] and [VBTRF] be reserved and remitted to the Primorskiy

  Krai Arbitration Court; and that until such final determination thereof all further

  proceedings herein are to be stayed;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) alternatively, that the purported

  Agreement dated 16 January 1998 allegedly made between [Falkland] and [VBTRF] be declared

  null and void and to have been of no effect whatsoever; and that [VBTRF] be substituted as

  the owners of the ship or vessel ‘Virgo I’ (previously known as the

  ‘Kapitan Voloshin’) [as] the defendants herein in place of

  ‘[Falkland]’; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) the costs of these proceedings and

  this application be taxed and paid by [Falkland] to [VBTRF]."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">I shall refer to this application as the

"VBTRF application". Falkland responded with the application for security for

costs which is the subject matter of this appeal. The security ordered has been provided

by VBTRF.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. Section 388(1) of the Companies Act

provides:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Where a corporation is plaintiff in

  any action or other legal proceeding the court having jurisdiction in the matter may, if

  it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the company will be

  unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his defence, require sufficient

  security to be given for those costs ...."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Mr Khoo conceded that for the purpose of

the VBTRF application VBTRF is a "plaintiff" within the meaning of s 388(1). Its

case is that Falkland is not a "defendant" and accordingly s 388(1) does not

apply as regards its costs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">VBTRF as plaintiff</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. In <i>Tomlinson v The Land and Finance

Corporation Ltd </i>(1884) 14 QBD 539 goods in the possession of the debtor were seized by

the sheriff in execution upon a judgment. A claim to the goods having been made by a

holder of a bill of sale the sheriff interpleaded and the court ordered an issue to be

tried in which the claimant should be plaintiff and the execution creditors defendants and

that the question to be tried should be whether at the time of the seizure by the sheriff

the goods were the property of the claimant as against the execution creditors. The

execution creditors were ordered to give security for costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. Brett MR said at p 541:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"If the chattels are claimed under an

  alleged title which is inconsistent with the supposed property of the execution debtors,

  upon the sheriff interpleading the execution creditors will have to prove that they are

  entitled to the chattels seized: it is true that the execution creditors are usually made

  defendants in the interpleader issue, but they have to assert their right, and

  substantially are plaintiffs ...."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Bowen LJ said at p 542:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The claimant to goods seized under a

  writ of fieri facias is usually bound to prove his title to them upon the trial of the

  interpleader issue; but this does not put the execution creditor into the position of an

  ordinary defendant; and when an interpleader issue has been directed and the sheriff has

  slipped out of the dispute, the parties who remain, that is, the execution creditor and

  the claimant, are both plaintiffs, they are not in the position of the parties to an

  ordinary action."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. In <i>In re Milward &amp; Co </i>[1900] 1 Ch 405 the solicitors were ordered to pay into court a fund in their hands belonging to

a client and an inquiry was directed who was entitled to it. Upon the inquiry a claimant

resident out of the jurisdiction claimed to have a charge on the fund. He was ordered to

give security for costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. Lindley MR said at p 407:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The solicitors had a sum of money in

  their hands upon which Shield alleges that he has a charge. That sum belongs to Mrs

  Gardner unless Shield can establish his charge. In substance he is in the position of a

  plaintiff, and not of a defendant. It is Mrs Gardner’s money unless he can make a

  claim upon it. Under these circumstances, the true analogy is that which I have suggested,

  namely, that it is an interpleader issue; and, that being so, Mr Shield must be ordered to

  give security for costs."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Mr Shield had to assert his right and he

was substantially a plaintiff.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. In the present case the balance of the

proceeds of sale have been paid into court. Subject to the claims of creditors if any they

belong to the owner of the vessel at the time of its arrest. VBTRF claims to be the owner.

It has applied for the issue of the validity and enforceability of an agreement dated 16

January 1998 (an agreement among other things for transfer of the vessel to Falkland) to

be remitted to a tribunal in Russia. Alternatively it asks this court to declare the

agreement to be null and void and to substitute it as owner of the vessel and defendant in

place of Falkland. If such an order is made the effect is to allow VBTRF to apply for

payment out of the balance of the proceeds of sale to itself. VBTRF is asserting its right

to the fund in court. I think it is in substance the plaintiff in the proceeding in

relation to the VBTRF application and Mr Khoo’s concession has been properly made.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Falkland as defendant</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. In <i>Tomlinson </i>Brett MR went on

to say at p 541:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"... both the execution creditors and

  the claimants were plaintiffs, neither were defendants in point of fact, although on the

  record, as a matter of convenience, one party was made plaintiff, and the other

  defendant."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">He was of course referring to the position

under the Interpleader Act and the subsequent statutes relating to interpleader (since

repealed) but the position on this point was the same under Order LVII then in force and

would be the same in the case before me under O 17. Bowen LJ said that neither party was

in the position of an <i>ordinary defendant</i>. They were both in agreement that the

execution creditors’ appeal against the order for security for costs to be given

should be dismissed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. In <i>The Silver Fir </i>[1980] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 371 the disponent owners of the vessel claimed against the charterers in

an arbitration damages for repudiation of the charter-party for wrongful refusal to load

their cargo and in their points of defence the charterers alleged that the vessel was not

at any material time ready to load any cargo under the charter-party and gave particulars

in support of their allegation. They went on to allege that each of the particulars

pleaded constituted a breach of the charter-party and as a result those allegations became

the basis of their counterclaim for damages. Both parties were corporations registered and

carrying on business out of the jurisdiction. In the court below security for costs was

ordered against the claimants but not against the respondents in respect of the

counterclaim. On appeal security for costs was ordered.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. Lawton LJ at p 374 referred to <i>Neck

v Taylor </i>[1893] 1 QB 560 where Lord Esher MR said at p 562:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Where, however, the counterclaim is

  not in respect of a wholly distinct matter, but arises in respect of the same matter or

  transaction upon which the claim is founded, the court will not, merely because the party

  counterclaiming is resident out of the jurisdiction, order security for costs; it will in

  that case consider whether the counterclaim is not in substance put forward as a defence

  to the claim, whatever form in point of strict law and of pleading it may take, and, if

  so, what under all the circumstances will be just and fair as between the parties; and

  will act accordingly."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">He held that the court had a discretion to

order security to be given.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. In <i>The Silver Fir</i> security for

costs was ordered against both the claimants and the respondents in the arbitration. The

orders were made applying O 23 pursuant to which the court may order security for

"the <i>defendant’s </i>costs of the action or other proceeding as it thinks

just". Each of the parties was in substance a plaintiff and the other a defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. In <i>Tomlinson</i> security was

ordered against the execution creditors for the costs of the claimant in the trial of the

issue. There were no other parties involved. In <i>In re Milward &amp; Co</i> the claimant

was ordered to give security for the costs of the solicitors’ client in the inquiry.

There was no other party or at any rate no other party at that stage. In <i>The Silver Fir

</i>orders were made for security for costs against both parties to the arbitration. Both

were plaintiffs and both were defendants for the purpose of O 23. It seems to me that

where a party would if he is successful in his defence in an action or other legal

proceeding be entitled to the costs of his defence against another party if costs follow

the event and that other party is a plaintiff for the purpose of s 388(1) of the Companies

Act or O 23 r 1 then the first party is a defendant for this purpose.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. If Falkland succeeds in its defence in

the VBTRF application and costs follow the event it would have the costs of its defence

against VBTRF. VBTRF is a plaintiff in this application for the purpose of s 388(1) of the

Companies Act. In my judgment Falkland is a defendant and it is entitled to apply for

security for its costs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Discretion</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. VBTRF is in liquidation and it is not

in dispute that it will be unable to pay Falkland’s costs if Falkland is successful

in its defence. What I have to consider is what under all the circumstances will be just

and fair as between the parties. VBTRF borrowed US$7m from Falkland. It agreed to repay

the loan by July 1997. As security for the loan VBTRF mortgaged the vessel to Falkland.

VBTRF has defaulted and on Falkland’s application the vessel was arrested on 14

November 1997 by order of the Dalian Court. This is a summary of the facts recited in the

agreement dated 16 January 1998 which VBTRF is seeking to have declared null and void. The

agreement provides for the transfer of the vessel to Falkland in partial discharge of

VBTRF’s indebtedness and to that extent total discharge of the mortgage obligations.

In the VBTRF application the indebtedness of VBTRF and its default are not disputed but it

is alleged that Mr Nikitenko Nikolay Ivanovich who signed the agreement for and on behalf

of VBTRF had no authority to do so.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. Mr Khoo has not invited my attention

to any other circumstances which I should take into account and in the circumstances which

I have outlined I think VBTRF ought to be ordered to give security for Falkland’s

costs of its defence of the VBTRF application. I think security should be in an amount of

$20,000 and I made an order accordingly.</font></p>
