the judgment of the court):</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">1 </span>It is axiomatic that in order to arrive at a fully considered decision based on justice and fairness, the court concerned must have <span class="font-italic">all</span> the relevant evidence before it. The present appeal turns on this one fundamental point. Put simply, was <span class="font-italic">all</span> the relevant evidence before the judge in the court below? If it was not, then there would have been no way for the judge to have arrived at a <span class="font-italic">considered</span> decision simply because he would not have been in receipt of the <span class="font-italic">full</span> picture. It would be akin to a viewer focusing on only one part of a canvas instead of the entire painting. Another analogy would be the old adage that one should not miss the wood for the trees. We hasten to add that this does not imply in the least that the trees are unimportant. After all, without the trees there would be no wood. When, however, one is lost in the midst of the wood and takes only <span class="font-italic">some</span> of the trees as representing the entire wood, the overall perspective may be skewed and distorted as a result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">2 </span>With these important general observations in mind, we turn to consider the present case. This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in <span class="font-italic">SI</span><span class="font-italic">C College of Business and Technology Pte Ltd v Yeo Poh Siah and others</span> [2015] SGHC 133 (“the GD”). The facts of the case are straightforward. However, the issue referred to in the preceding paragraph arises as a result of the manner in which the proceedings unfolded before the Judge in the court below. In essence, the case involved a claim and a counterclaim. The claim was dismissed as the plaintiff (“the Appellant”) had failed to provide the requisite security for costs. There has been no appeal against that particular decision. However, the defendants (“the Respondents”), who included the former employees of the Appellant, succeeded in their counterclaim and this is the subject of the present appeal. It is against this backdrop that the complications arose. Whilst the Judge acknowledged (in the GD at [3]; emphasis added) that “a flavour of the allegations brought by the plaintiff [the Appellant, and in relation to <span class="font-italic">the main claim</span>] <span class="font-italic">provides helpful context</span>”, he <span class="font-italic">refused to </span><span class="font-italic">consider certain key pieces of</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">evidence with respect to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the main claim</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">in the trial of the counterclaim</span><span class="font-italic">, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">even though</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> such evidence might conceivably have been relevant to refute the Respondents</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">’ evidence and case in the counterclaim</span>. The qualification in the aforementioned sentence is of the first importance because whilst any evidence led with respect to the main claim could not possibly have affected the determination of the main claim simply because it had already been <span class="font-italic">dismissed</span>, this does <span class="font-italic">not</span> mean that such evidence was <span class="font-italic">necessarily irrelevant</span> <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the counterclaim</span>. In point of fact, however, because the Appellant was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>permitted to lead key pieces of evidence <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> its <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">main claim</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is unclear </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(in the present circumstances) whether any such evidence would in fact have refuted the counterclaim – and herein lies the crux of the present appeal </span>(as we shall elaborate upon below). In this regard, it ought to be borne in mind that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">both the main claim and the counterclaim were </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">inextricably</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">connected with each other</span>. Indeed, the Judge himself observed (significantly, in our view), as follows (see the GD at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Admittedly, the plaintiff [the Appellant] <span class="font-italic">was </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">hamstrung</span><span class="font-italic"> to the exten</span><span class="font-italic">t that its case was that the 18 transactions in the ledger was </span>[<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">just part of a larger scheme to defraud the plaintiff, but its inability to shed light on the purported bigger picture was a corollary of the failure to provide security for costs for the main claim.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">3 </span>We proceed to analyse this case more <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> by turning, first, to the facts of the case and decision below before rendering our decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties to the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span>The Appellant is a company in the private education business. Kannappan s/o Karuppan Chettiar (“KC”) was the chairman of the Appellant at the material time. His wife (Cenobia Majella (“CM”)) and brother (Subramaniam s/o Karuppan Chettiar) are directors of the Appellant. CM is the Appellant’s majority shareholder while TSG Investments Pte Ltd (“TSG”) and KC are the other shareholders. At all material times, TSG was controlled by KC and CM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span>The first three Respondents were the Appellant’s employees at the material time – the first Respondent (Ken Yeo) was a director of the Appellant, the second Respondent (Koo Khee Chong (“Koo”)) was the chief financial officer of the Appellant and the third Respondent (Chua Puay Choo Alvinna) was a senior management consultant of the Appellant. They were also the directors of the fourth Respondent, Lincoln Collegiate of Business and Technology Private Limited (“Lincoln College”), a company which was incorporated on 8 January 2009 and which had been contracted to operate the Appellant’s business under certain licensing agreements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>KC and Ken Yeo had known each other since about 1991 when Ken Yeo was KC’s personal assistant in the Singapore Institute of Commerce (“SIC”), which was the predecessor of the Appellant. KC<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>lost touch with Ken Yeo sometime in 1992 or 1993 when KC left SIC, and Ken Yeo also later left SIC to set up Auston Business School. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span>Sometime in 2005, Ken Yeo was made an employee of TSG by KC. KC was the executive chairman of TSG, which had acquired SIC in 1999. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">8 </span>In 2007, there was a corporate reorganisation and Ken Yeo was appointed the executive director of the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span>Between 2009 and 2010 a number of agreements were signed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Harbridge Agreement dated 16 January 2009 was an agreement between the Appellant and Lincoln College (which was then known as “Harbridge Holdings Pte Ltd”) in which it was agreed that Lincoln College would be allowed to jointly operate a subsidiary of the Appellant known as SIC Tampines. Lincoln College agreed to be solely responsible for the operational expenses of SIC Tampines and agreed to pay the Appellant a licence fee. It was Ken Yeo’s evidence that it was implied that Lincoln College was entitled to the income of SIC Tampines.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The SICC Agreement dated 9 September 2009 was an agreement between TSG, the Appellant and SIC College Pte Ltd (“SICC”) (incorporated by Ken Yeo and with Ken Yeo and Koo as the shareholders) in which SICC was appointed to manage the operations of the Appellant for an initial period of two years in return for SICC paying TSG a monthly fee of $150,000 during the period. Ken Yeo claimed it was obvious to all involved that SICC was entitled to the income of the Appellant while bearing the expenses.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Mutual Release Agreement (“MRA”) dated 11 February 2010 was an agreement between TSG, the Appellant and SICC in which the parties released one another from liability and SICC warranted that the final payment of $150,000 due on 31 December 2009 for licensing fees from Lincoln College to the Appellant would be made.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Second Harbridge Agreement dated 11 February 2010 was an agreement between TSG and Lincoln College wherein it was agreed that the latter was to manage the business of the Appellant and pay TSG monthly licensing fees and that it would be entitled to claim management fees from TSG, which was defined as the surplus of the Appellant’s licensed operation subject to the Appellant being able to accumulate an annual profit of $10,000 and being able to maintain its balance sheet as at 1 January 2010 or a net tangible asset of $600,000, whichever is higher.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span> It should be noted that the interpretation of the terms of the clauses in the above agreements was disputed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span>Cracks in the relationship between KC and Ken Yeo emerged in February 2010 when KC sought arrears of the licensing fee and Ken Yeo wanted to terminate the SICC Agreement. These cracks were exacerbated when Ken Yeo shifted some furniture between the Appellant’s premises at Upper Serangoon Road and SICC’s premises. Eventually, a compromise was reached, resulting in the conclusion of the MRA and Second Harbridge Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span>On 10 December 2012, the Appellant and TSG filed a Writ of Summons against the first three Respondents. The Writ and Statement of Claim were subsequently amended for TSG to be removed as a plaintiff and for Lincoln College to be added as a defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">13 </span>To summarise, the Appellant’s claim – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the main claim – concerned a number of heads of claim, to the effect that the first three Respondents were parties to a scheme to enrich Lincoln College (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the fourth Respondent) at the Appellant’s expense, and this included (amongst others) claims for a number of alleged unauthorised payments to Lincoln College between 30 October 2009 and 21 October 2010, the alleged misappropriation of funds from the Appellant’s students, and the alleged making of fraudulent payments to the Respondents which were fraudulently authorised as personal claims. These alleged unlawful acts were accomplished (at least in part) by the entering of fictitious entries into the Appellant’s books.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">14 </span>The Respondent’s defence against the aforementioned heads of claim were, besides the denial of the averments, essentially, that under the relevant licensing agreements, Lincoln College (or SICC) was entitled to the Appellant’s proceeds less expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span>At a hearing on 18 March 2013 (this was a few days after the original Defence was filed on 12 March 2013), the then-counsel for the Respondents indicated to a Senior Assistant Registrar that he had instructions to apply for security for costs against the Appellant. The Senior Assistant Registrar ordered that the application for security for costs should be made by 28 March 2013. However, no application was made by that date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">16 </span>On 6 December 2013 (almost a year after the original writ was filed), the Defence was amended to institute the counterclaim by Ken Yeo against the Appellant. The counterclaim stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71. The Defendants aver that at all material times, [Ken Yeo] had been making advances to the [Appellant] on a running account basis to supplement the cashflow of the [Appellant].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72. The balance owing from the [Appellant] to [Ken Yeo] is $244,844…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The running account, consisting of 18 transactions, is particularised in a table which is set out at [9] of the GD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span> The Appellant’s defence to the counterclaim stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44. Paragraphs 71 and 72 of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 3) are wholly denied and [Ken Yeo] is put to strict proof thereof. The [Appellant] avers that there was no need and/or reason for the [Appellant] to receive any cash advances from [Ken Yeo] as it had its own finances to support itself. The [Appellant] avers that [Ken Yeo] had never made any advances to the [Appellant] but instead, used the [Appellant’s] accounting books to create fictitious entries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">18 </span>On 10 July 2014, the Respondents filed Summons No 3367 of 2014 (“SUM 3367”) to seek security for costs from the Appellant in the sum of $100,000. This was after timelines had already been set for the filing of affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”). The AEICs were to be filed by 25 July 2014. At a hearing on 15 July 2014, the Respondents’ counsel stated that the reason for taking out security for costs at that stage was because the Respondents were recently made aware of the fact that the Appellant’s former lawyer had yet to be paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>On 12 August 2014, an Assistant Registrar ordered the Appellant to furnish security for costs in the sum of $75,000 by 26 August 2014, and that the proceedings, in so far as they concerned the Appellant’s claims, be stayed pending the provision of such security. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>On 18 August 2014, the parties appeared before the Judge for a pre-trial conference (“PTC”). The Judge emphasised that security for costs must be paid in by 26 August 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">21 </span>On 26 August 2014, the Appellant’s former counsel, Mr Edmond Pereira (“Mr Pereira”), wrote to inform the court that the Appellant had failed to provide security for costs by the due date, and that his firm would be discharging themselves from acting in the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">22 </span>At a PTC on 2 September 2014, Mr Pereira informed an Assistant Registrar that he would be discharging himself and his firm because his fees had not been paid. KC personally informed the Assistant Registrar that he was looking to be represented by a new law firm and that he needed more time to raise the funds for security for costs. At the same time, the Respondents’ counsel gave notice to KC that they would, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, be seeking personal costs against him and CM. In the circumstances, the Assistant Registrar declined to shift the trial and he kept the first two trial dates (9 and 10 September 2014) and vacated the remaining four days of the original six-day trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">23 </span>On 9 September 2014, the first day of trial, the Judge granted Mr Pereira’s application to discharge himself. KC was allowed to conduct the trial as an officer of the Appellant. KC also made an oral application for an extension of time (until 30 September 2014) to furnish security for costs and to vacate the trial, while the Respondents’ counsel made an oral application to dismiss the main claim for being in default for the furnishing of security for costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>On 10 September 2014, the Judge dismissed the Appellant’s application for extension of time for the furnishing of security for costs and consequently dismissed the main claim. He also formally granted leave to KC to represent the Appellant as an officer of the Appellant under O 1 r 9(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed) (pursuant to the Appellant’s application in Summons No 4478 of 2014).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">25 </span>As mentioned at the outset of this judgment, the main claim was dismissed owing to the Appellant’s failure to provide security for costs by the 26 August 2014 deadline. As already noted, the Judge rejected KC’s request for an extension of time to 30 September 2014 for the furnishing of the requisite security. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">26 </span>In so far as the counterclaim was concerned, the Judge referred to a ledger which had been printed out from the Appellant’s system listing the alleged 18 transactions in the alleged running account showing a balance of $244,844 owing from the Appellant to Ken Yeo (“the Printout”). There were a number of bank receipts that showed certain cash withdrawals from Ken Yeo’s and Lincoln College’s account. The Judge also considered that the ledger provided by Ken Yeo was substantiated by a document produced by Supramaniam s/o Nasaiah (“Supramaniam”), who was the Appellant’s own witness. We shall hereinafter refer to that document as “Supramaniam’s Document”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">27 </span>While the Judge also referred to the Appellant’s asserted entitlement to set off a series of unauthorised payments against Ken Yeo’s counterclaim as well as the Appellant’s argument that the 18 transactions in the Printout were just part of a larger scheme to defraud the Appellant, the Judge considered that the Appellant was <span class="font-italic">not</span> entitled to prove the alleged instances of misappropriation which necessarily pertained to the main claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>The Judge also made a number of other findings as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The sums recorded as originating from Lincoln College were in fact advances by Ken Yeo, which were made by Lincoln College on Ken Yeo’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Appellant might have required advances to smoothen its cash flow, even if it had sufficient finances to support itself.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Printout could be admitted under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) as a statement that was made in the course of trade, business, profession or other occupation. Furthermore, s 34 of the Evidence Act stated that entries in account books that are regularly kept in the course of business are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into which the court has to inquire. The Judge also found that the Printout was not entirely unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ken Yeo had the authority to, and did, make the advances under the auspices of the licensing arrangements pursuant to which Lincoln College and SICC were required to manage the Appellant’s business.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) An adverse inference was to be drawn against the Appellant for not disclosing bank statements on certain dates when the Appellant was able to do so for others.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>The Judge then allowed the counterclaim in the sum of $218,000 after excluding four transactions in the Printout as they appeared to be entirely uncorroborated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span>Finally, the Judge also ordered personal costs against KC and CM, to be borne by them jointly and severally together with the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>The Appellant appeals against the decision of the judge to allow the counterclaim and order personal costs against KC and CM. There is no appeal against the Judge’s decision to dismiss the main claim for the Appellant’s default in providing security for costs. The issues that arise are the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) With respect to the appeal in relation to the counterclaim, the first issue is whether the Judge was correct in determining the scope of the evidence to be considered; and if the Judge had erred in respect of the first issue, there is a second issue of whether this caused a substantial wrong, and if it did, what would be the appropriate remedy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In so far as the appeal against the order of costs is concerned, the issue is what the appropriate costs order should be in the circumstances, in particular, whether third party costs should have been ordered against KC and CM.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ respective arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appellant’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span>In the Appellant’s submission, the Judge had erred in failing to consider facts in issue and evidence which are relevant to the defence to the counterclaim (“the Rejected Evidence”). The Appellant argues that there is a clear link between the defence to the counterclaim and the material facts in the main claim and that this is apparent when the pleadings are read in their totality and in the proper context, such that there is no question of a failure of pleading. It further submits that the Rejected Evidence would have made a difference to the outcome of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span>The Appellant also contends that Ken Yeo had failed to prove the existence of a “running account”, which is clearly different from an argument that each individual advance was a debt in itself. The Judge had merely considered whether each advance was made, and not <span class="font-italic">why </span>the advance was made (if indeed they were). Even if there was a running account, it was still necessary for the Judge to consider the transactions in their <span class="font-italic">totality</span> and not merely those particular transactions which Ken Yeo had picked to reflect a balance that was positive to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">34 </span>Finally, the Appellant argues that it was inappropriate for the Judge to order costs to be borne jointly and severally by KC and CM with the Appellant. KC and CM did not have the intention of ultimately deriving a benefit from the suit and they did not cause the incurring of costs. It was, therefore, unjust for the Judge to have so ordered.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Respondents’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">35 </span>The Respondents argue that, as the proper enquiry is whether the advances claimed were made or not, the Appellant has mischaracterised the true issue. Furthermore, even if the Judge had erred in excluding the Rejected Evidence, it would not justify setting aside the decision, as it has not resulted in any substantial wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>The Respondents also submitted that the Appellant has misunderstood what “running account” was meant by the Respondents – all they meant was an “ongoing account”. The Respondents have not sought an account as a final relief; they are just seeking the repayment of an advance. Even if the relief sought is for an account, the evidence demonstrates that the liability is between Lincoln College and the Appellant and not between Ken Yeo and the Appellant. In any event, the evidence relied on by the Appellant to demonstrate sums owing to them were inadmissible and/or unreliable. The Judge was correct to allow the counterclaim as the evidence is sufficient to prove that the sum allowed was transferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>Finally, the Judge was correct to order personal costs against KC and CM as KC and CM were the ones who funded the proceedings, were in control of the litigation and would derive the ultimate benefit from the litigation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The proper scope of the evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>The Judge had summarised his understanding of the Appellant’s pleaded defence to the counterclaim at [5] of the GD:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The [Appellant’s] pleaded defence to the counter-claim was that the [Appellant] had no need and/or reason to receive any cash advances from [Ken Yeo] as it had its own finances to support itself. It also asserted that [Ken Yeo] had never made any advances to the [Appellant] but instead, used the [Appellant’s] accounting books to create fictitious entries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>According to the Judge, the Appellant could and should have done more for its pleaded case, for example, by producing bank documents which would demonstrate whether any of the advances had entered the Appellant’s account (see the GD at [22]). The Judge also noted that because the Appellant’s claim had been dismissed, alleged instances of misappropriation by the Respondent could not be proven as they pertained to the main claim (see the GD at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40 </span>In our view, it is not, with respect, correct for the Judge to have denied the Appellant the opportunity to prove relevant facts in respect of the counterclaim simply because these facts would also prove the main claim, which had been stayed and subsequently dismissed. This is so for several reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span>First, facts which are relevant to the main claim may similarly be facts which are relevant to the Appellant’s defence to the counterclaim. As pointed out by the Appellant, s 3 of the Evidence Act defines a “fact in issue” as including “any fact from which either by itself or in connection with other facts the existence, non-existence, nature or extent of any right, liability or disability asserted or denied … necessarily follows”. The starting point is that “every litigant has a general right to bring all evidence <span class="font-italic">relevant </span>to his or her case to the attention of the court”, and that, while a litigant should not be allowed to abuse the processes of the court to further his ulterior or collateral motives, “it is usually both prudent and just to err in favour of admission rather than exclusion” (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co</span><span class="font-italic">-operative</span> <span class="font-italic">Ltd and others </span>[2010] 3 SLR 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Basil</span>”) at [24]–[26] [emphasis in original]). The implication of the main claim being dismissed for the failure to provide security for costs is that, even if the plaintiff manages to establish for the purposes of his defence to the counterclaim the same facts in issue that would allow him to succeed on the main claim, he would still be unable to secure judgment on his claim: see the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Dumrul v Standard Chartered Bank </span>[2010] 2 CLC 661 (“<span class="font-italic">Dumrul</span>”) (at [18]). But there is <span class="font-italic">no rule</span> that facts which are relevant in establishing a defence to the counterclaim cannot be <span class="font-italic">proven </span>simply because these same facts would establish liability under the main claim as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span>Secondly, in our view, the various allegations of misappropriation of funds were sufficiently pleaded as part of the defence to the counterclaim. Much reliance was placed by the Respondent on the fact that the substantive defence to the counterclaim was encompassed within para 44 of the Reply and Defence to the Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) under the heading “DEFENCE TO COUNTERCLAIM”, which we had set out above at [17]. We shall simply refer to that paragraph hereinafter as “Para 44”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>The Judge had concluded that the pleading was that the entries were “fictitious” in the sense that monies never entered the Appellant’s account and therefore the <span class="font-italic">only</span> issue in controversy was whether these monies had in fact entered the Appellant’s account. In our view, even taken in isolation, the reference to “fictitious entries” in Para 44 could reasonably be interpreted to encompass the argument that the entries were inaccurately characterised as “advances”, thereby rendering them a fiction. This could legitimately mean both that monies had never entered the Appellant’s account or that the monies were never intended as advances, thereby amounting to spurious entries. This is <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>the case when the pleadings are viewed holistically and Para 44 is understood in its proper context, rather than in a vacuum. At the time the Reply and Defence to the Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) was filed, there was no indication that the main claim would not be proceeded with; there was no separate discovery exercise, there were no separate AEICs filed, and the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim was one composite whole embodied in a single document. In the paragraphs preceding Para 44, the Appellant had raised facts to allege that the Respondent had misappropriated funds from the Appellant. For example, at para 42, it was pleaded that: “the [Appellant] avers that the [Respondents] have no legitimate and/or valid defence whatsoever towards the unlawful withdrawal of $1.59mil”. Although these facts did not fall under the heading “DEFENCE TO COUNTERCLAIM”, and were pleaded for the purpose of establishing the main claim, they provide the context to what the Appellant meant when it stated in its defence that the entries were “fictitious”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>As argued by the Appellant, “the point is that the 18 transactions formed part of a larger series of transactions”. The Appellant also sought to establish this point during the first day of the trial, although this was met with resistance by counsel for the Respondents:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Plaintiff:  Your Honour, I---I’ll be making submissions on that point. And I think I am entitled to it on---the minimum is equitable grounds, and I will show to the Court the close connection. Because if one person has the power---the full power to give himself to his companies, wife and everybody else, and he’s done that, and now he’s claiming for amount all he has given, that’s only part of a transaction. We need to consider, Your Honour, the full transaction, the full load, what he’s actually done. We are not proceeding with the Court stay order on the claim. We are not claiming. We are defending, Your Honour. As defence, we are entitled to examine what was the intention, and we will. Because he gave up---wrote out the cheques, that means he had full control over the plaintiffs’ bank accounts. <span class="font-italic">He wrote out in certain synchronised fashion to deplete fully the plaintiffs’ bank account. Now he’s coming to claim for monies that are part of the entire transaction. We need to be able to examine the whole transaction and the reason why we are claiming it is fictitious. We need to be able to demonstrate that these were fictitious part of a major scheme. That’s our defence.</span> And to examine that defence, we will have to examine the agreement because he says, “We are entitled to it”. If he says “Entitled to it” and takes off and he’s put it in part of the claim that he’s taken off money, then we are entitled to examine, Your Honour, I believe.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>In our view, the pleadings sufficiently encompass the averment that the monies that were credited into the Appellant’s account (if any) were part of the Respondents’ fraudulent scheme and under the guise of being “advances”. The <span class="font-italic">pur</span><span class="font-italic">pose </span>of the transactions is being called into question, and it is <span class="font-italic">not </span>simply whether the monies did or did not <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>enter the Appellant’s account. When viewed through this lens, the Respondents’ misappropriation of funds and facts relating to this purported fraudulent scheme did form part of the Appellant’s pleaded defence to the counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>Thirdly, it must be emphasised that procedure is the handmaiden of justice, not its master. In <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1422 (“<span class="font-italic">Nithia</span>”), this court embarked on a review of the law of pleadings and observed (at [2]) that the process of pleadings is to ensure, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the plaintiff knows the nature and substance of the defence. A court should not adopt “an overly formalistic and inflexibly rule-bound approach” which might result in injustice (see <span class="font-italic">Nithia </span>at [39]). Ultimately, the underlying consideration of the law of pleadings is to prevent surprises arising at trial (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lu Bang Song v Teambuild Construction P</span><span class="font-italic">te Ltd and Another and Another Appeal </span>[2009] SGHC 49 at [17]). In the present case, it can hardly be said that the Respondents had been taken by surprise. From the pleadings as well as the AEICs, the Respondents were clearly apprised of the line of argument which the Appellant was seeking to advance but attempted to limit the pleaded defence on the technical basis that there was no “pleading that incorporates the entire claim”. However, it could not have escaped the Respondent’s attention that the Appellant had never regarded the 18 transactions as legitimate “advances” and that this formed a basis of its defence as articulated in Para 44.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">47 </span>We therefore find that the Judge had wrongly determined the scope of the evidence and had erred in excluding the Rejected Evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the error led to substantial injustice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">48 </span>While we find that the Judge should have considered the Rejected Evidence it does not necessarily follow that his decision must be reversed or a new trial ordered, if it can be shown that the result was correct in any event. Order 57 r 14 of the Rules of Court states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1)  On the hearing of any appeal the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks fit, make any such order as could be made in pursuance of an application for a new trial or to set aside any finding or judgment of the Court below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The Court of Appeal shall not be bound to order a new trial on the ground of misdirection, or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, unless in the opinion of the Court of Appeal <span class="font-italic">some substantial wrong has been thereby occasioned</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">49 </span> In so far as the error relates to the improper rejection of evidence, s 169 of the Evidence Act states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">No new trial for improper admission or rejection of evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">169.  The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case if it appears to the court before which such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, <span class="font-italic">or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">50 </span>Section 39(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) similarly provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  A new trial shall not be granted on the ground of improper admission or rejection of evidence unless in the opinion of the Court of Appeal some substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has been thereby occasioned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>The question therefore turns on whether any substantial wrong had been caused by the exclusion of the Rejected Evidence. The Respondents say that, even if the Rejected Evidence was considered, it would not have made any difference to the Judge’s decision. However, before we proceed to answer this question, we note that the Appellant had pitched its case at an even higher level. It argues that, <span class="font-italic">on the evidence actually adduced</span>, the Respondents have not proven the counterclaim and therefore the Judge’s decision must be reversed. We first address this argument advanced by the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>The Appellant contends that the <span class="font-italic">key </span>piece of evidence relied upon by the Judge was the Printout. The Printout had been extracted from the Appellant’s system and provided by Koo, but Koo was not called to give evidence, and the admissibility of this piece of evidence was challenged on the basis of hearsay. While the Printout was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>admissible under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Evidence Act as a statement made in the course of trade, business, profession or other occupation, the court is nevertheless required to properly consider the discretion to exclude such evidence under s 32(3). This involves a balancing exercise involving weighing the significance of the evidence against its unreliability or other harm which might compromise fair adjudication (with the effect of being substantively unjust or procedurally oppressive): see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[2015] 2 SLR 686 at [105]–[109]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>The Judge made two key findings with respect to the Printout. First, the Judge considered that Supramaniam’s Document corroborated the Printout (at [13] of the GD). However, considering that this document and the Printout were all derived from the same source, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Appellant’s accounting software, we are unable to see why Supramaniam’s Document is corroborative of the <span class="font-italic">facts </span>stated in the<span class="font-italic"> </span>Printout, the same way a partial photocopy of a book does not corroborate the truth of the contents of the book. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>Secondly, the Judge found that even though Ken Yeo was not the person who made the entries, he was the supplier of the information on the transactions, which were (partly) substantiated by bank statements (see the GD at [20]). However, the Printout was relied on to <span class="font-italic">corroborate </span>or <span class="font-italic">prove </span>Ken Yeo’s assertions, which was that the moneys were transferred on a certain basis (which we will come to). One of the reasons why Koo should have been called in the first place is examine the veracity of <span class="font-italic">facts found within</span> the Printout. As the Judge had previously held in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Ting v Kea Kah Kim </span>[2014] 4 SLR 795 at [19], it is highly prejudicial for a party to rely on evidence that the maker of the statement can testify to but chooses not to do so, as it may give rise to the possibility that the party was trying to prevent the maker from being cross-examined because the evidence might not withstand cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>While it was ultimately within the scope of the Judge’s discretion to admit the evidence, the admission of the Printout was not in itself sufficient, without other evidence, to prove a <span class="font-italic">debt </span>because s 34 of the Evidence Act states that such statements “shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability”. The obvious danger of relying on account book entries is even greater if the claimant or one of his affiliates was the one who was making the records. This danger remains even if accountants had given an unqualified opinion on the previous consolidated accounts that formed the basis for<span class="font-italic"> </span>the first transaction on the ledger.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>The Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Ice-Mack Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[1989] 2 SLR(R) 283 is illustrative. The issue in that case was whether the pages from the applicant’s own ledger books were sufficient proof of debt against a company that was being wound up. The applicant and the company were associated companies as one Mr Valibhoy managed both companies. The applicant also adduced an audit confirmation of the sum owed. Yong Pung How CJ found that, in an arms-length situation, an audit confirmation would be strong evidence of the correctness of the credit or debit balance. However, because that confirmation was signed on behalf of the company by Mr Valibhoy, it could not be accepted as evidence of the debt unless it was corroborated by more independent evidence (at [11]). Further, at [20]−[21], Yong CJ stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20     Presented in a series of bits and pieces, the applicant’s case depended almost entirely on the acceptance of the evidence of its accountants and its own audited accounts, which it allowed to surface at need. The audited accounts of the applicant, as averred by Mr Valibhoy in his fourth affidavit of 9 March 1989, were indeed prepared to “reflect the state of affairs of the applicant for the use of its shareholders”, but auditors are dependent for their information regarding the affairs of a company on what is provided to them by the persons in control of the management of the company. In this connection, the relationship between these companies and the manner in which the persons who had exercised common control over them presented their claim merely depreciated the value which would normally be given to audited accounts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21     It may well be that, in what might be called a straightforward case, documents such as those produced by the applicant might be accepted as sufficient evidence to prove a debt obligation. But, in this case, once the validity of the claim was challenged, it was incumbent on the applicant to go to the root of the matter and to produce proper evidence of the various “loans and payments for and on behalf of the company” which added up to the figure of $2,428,418.49 and which it claimed to have made. There should have been the proofs indicated by r 81, specifying the credit and debit notes, the vouchers and receipts, and other documentary evidence by which these loans and payments for and on behalf of the company could be substantiated. This evidence had been asked for repeatedly by the Official Receiver but had not been forthcoming, and throughout the exchange of affidavits before this court, the applicant appeared to have studiously avoided dealing with this real issue.

Three points were emphasised by the Respondents in the hearing before us. First, they argue that the Rejected Evidence would at best go towards demonstrating a <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> and/or a propensity to create fictitious entries. If the specific entries were truly “fictitious”, the Appellant could simply have produced the bank statements to prove that the alleged advances had not been made. The Appellant failed to do so in the trial below. Secondly, the Respondents argue that the concept of a “running account” had been misunderstood by the Appellant. The Respondent does not seek an “account” as a form of final relief but specifically seeks the precise sum of $244,844 owned. Such a “running account” is not amorphous inasmuch as it is without start or end, and the appropriate delineation of the running account is from the period of 1 April 2010 to 8 October 2010 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the time period in which the 18 transactions were made). Thirdly, the Respondents contend that the counterclaim was brought by Ken Yeo against the Appellant and that the Rejected Evidence related only to alleged liabilities owing from Lincoln College to the Appellant. Therefore, it would not have been appropriate to consider the alleged liabilities of Lincoln College in the counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>In their first objection, the Respondents focus on the fact that the Appellant was unable to refute that the “advances” had actually entered the Appellant’s account. However, as noted above at [43], this is not the only way in which the entries may be construed to be “fictitious”. The fiction could conceivably lie in their characterisation as “advances”. Bank statements produced by the Appellant would not aid it in advancing this point. Instead, it is necessary for a court to look at <span class="font-italic">the full context</span> of the transactional history between the parties in order to arrive at a fair decision as to whether the sums were transferred, whether the transfers were in the nature of an advance or something else, and whether in the overall scheme of things Ken Yeo was the creditor and not the debtor. These issues could not be divorced from the allegations raised in the main claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">65 </span>In so far as the Respondents’ second objection is concerned, it seems to us that the parties have been overly fixated on the phrase “running account”, when the question should, instead, be whether the Rejected Evidence, if admitted, would go towards proving or disproving the <span class="font-italic">basis</span> for Ken Yeo’s argument that he is entitled to be repaid<span class="font-italic">. </span>The fact that some monies were transferred (if that is indeed the case) is only one small element of the dispute. The legal nature and purpose of the transfer is, if anything, just as important in determining liability. Thus, one must still ask what the transfer was truly <span class="font-italic">for</span>. Were the “advances” in the nature of loans (for the purpose of supplementing cash flows), gifts, consideration under a contract, repayment of loans, transfers to replenish funds that were taken out (whether properly or improperly), or transfers used to cover up a fraudulent scheme to misappropriate funds? Even if they were loans, one might ask whether they were just part of a larger set of interdependent transactions which were always intended to be netted off. One could not come to a full and considered decision by looking at <span class="font-italic">a mere snapshot</span> of one part of the transactional history between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">66 </span>Finally, the Respondents’ third objection may appear superficially attractive since liabilities owing from Lincoln College to the Appellant are technically separate and distinct from liabilities which the Appellant may owe to Ken Yeo, especially since the defence of set-off had not been pleaded by the Appellant. However, if it were indeed the case that Lincoln College had been siphoning off money from the Appellant without approval, and this was perpetrated by Ken Yeo, it could, in our view, shed light on the true nature of the transfer of monies from Ken Yeo to the Appellant. Again, the key question to be addressed is the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the transactions which form the basis of the counterclaim. Proof of a fraudulent scheme which was engendered as amongst the Respondents would be relevant to such an inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">67 </span>We hasten to add, and this bears emphasis, that our rejection of the Respondents’ objections above is not, in fairness to them, an indication that the Rejected Evidence <span class="font-italic">would</span><span class="font-italic"> definitely have</span> made a difference to the outcome of the case. It must be recalled that the threshold is that of “a substantial and realistic prospect of making a meaningful difference to the outcome of the case” and in our view, this threshold had been met. Indeed, the Judge’s own recognition that “the [Appellant] was hamstrung to the extent that its case was that the 18 transactions in the ledger [were] just part of a larger scheme to defraud the plaintiff” (see the GD at [17], also reproduced above at [2]) buttresses our conclusion that the Rejected Evidence did have the requisite prospect of making a meaningful difference to the outcome of the case. For this reason, the decision below cannot be allowed to stand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>We must next consider whether this court is in a position to evaluate the Rejected Evidence and determine the appeal on its substantive merits (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the second requirement in <span class="font-italic">Basil</span>). The following observations of this court at [56] of <span class="font-italic">Basil</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the present case, the evidence of the disallowed witnesses would certainly have a substantial and realistic prospect of making a meaningful difference to the outcome of the case. In fact, as we have said at various points, <span class="font-italic">the evidence of the disallowed witnesses might well be of decisive importance in confirming or refuting the factual positions taken by Basil and the respondents, as well as the credibility of each side’s witnesses. At the same time, it is impossible to say precisely what the evidence of the disallowed witnesses might be, whose evidence would be confirmed, and whose would be refuted. This can only be done by subjecting both parties’ witnesses to the crucible of cross-examination.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>Similarly, it is impossible, in relation to the present case, to say precisely what would have transpired if the Appellant had not been wrongfully denied the opportunity to present its full case, and what the crucible of cross-examination might have elicited from the various witnesses. Attempting to predict such an outcome would be an exercise in speculation and we are not prepared to venture into such murky waters. The Federal Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Chia Bak Eng</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Punggol Bus Service Co</span> [1965–1967] SLR(R) 270 is illustrative. In that case, the trial judge had erred in rejecting the evidence of one Lim Ah Huat (“Lim”), who was a bystander to an accident. The appellate court declined to simply reverse the conclusions of the learned judge and accept the evidence of Lim as true, primarily on the basis that this required a determination of Lim’s credibility, who was the only witness called by the plaintiff, and it was difficult to estimate correctly the credibility of the witness from the printed evidence (at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>Whilst the parties seek a final decision of this court on the merits, in preference to the trouble as well as concomitant costs of a retrial, especially given the Appellant’s monetary woes, this court is in no position to determine whose version of the facts should be believed based merely on the AEICs filed and the transcript generated from the limited cross-examination on the background facts relating to both the counterclaim and main claim that was permitted below. We see no alternative but to order a retrial, notwithstanding that this was a remedy that has not been sought by either party (see O 57 r 13 of the Rules of Court; see also the Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Ku Chiu Chung</span><span class="font-italic"> Woody v Tang Tin Sung </span>[2003] HKEC 727<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [22]−[28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>However, as the Judge had only allowed the counterclaim in the sum of $218,000, which is less than the District Court limit of $250,000, we consider it appropriate that the trial of the counterclaim be held in the District Court, as we take the view that the Respondents, even if entirely successful, would not recover anything more than what the Judge had awarded. This was also the situation in <span class="font-italic">Basil </span>(at [81]) where this court exercised its powers under para 10 of the First Schedule to the SCJA and s 54C(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (now the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed)), read with s 29A(3) of the SCJA, to send the case to the District Court to be heard. We so order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>Before we depart from the present analysis, although the Appellant has not appealed against the decisions to award security for costs or the subsequent stay and dismissal of the main claim for failure to furnish security, it would be appropriate for us to make a few observations as to the appropriateness of ordering such security in circumstances such as the present, where in dealing with the <span class="font-italic">substance </span>of the claim and the counterclaim, many of the same issues would arise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Security for costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>The order for security for costs in this case was made under s 388 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Security for costs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">388.—(1) Where a corporation is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding the court having jurisdiction in the matter may, if it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his defence, require sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security is given. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>There is no question that the court has jurisdiction to award security for costs in the present case.

This is because “while it is up to a plaintiff to decide on whether to run the risk of suing a party who may not be good for costs, a defendant has no comparable choice” (<span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">ingapore Civil Procedure Volume I</span> (GP Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2015) (“SCP”) at para 23/0/2).

This is a weighty factor, as the following cases will illustrate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span>We begin with the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Jurong Town Corp v Wishing Star Ltd</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 427 (“<span class="font-italic">Wishing Star</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star,</span> the dispute revolved around whether the contract between the parties was validly terminated. The appellant terminated the contract alleging that the respondent had made material misrepresentations in its tender submission for the contract. The respondent commenced legal proceedings against the appellant for wrongful termination. The appellant claimed that it had lawfully rescinded the contract and counterclaimed for damages suffered. The appellant subsequently applied for security for costs nearly four months after trial dates had been set down. The Court of Appeal agreed with the assistant registrar and the High Court judge that security should not be ordered in that case. The Court of Appeal identified two factors in <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star </span>as weighing heavily in the respondent’s favour (at [16]−[21]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first was the delay in taking out the application. Numerous steps had been taken in the proceedings by the time it was filed, and substantial work had already been undertaken by the solicitors of both parties. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The other factor was the fact that, given the substantial overlap between the appellant’s defence to the claim and the counterclaim, no significant additional costs would be incurred by the appellant whether or not the claim of the respondent was stayed. It was a significant consideration that granting security in such a situation could amount to indirectly aiding the appellant to pursue its counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>Before dealing with the second factor highlighted in the preceding paragraph, it would be useful to take a moment to discuss the effect of delay on an application for security for costs. The weight to be given to this factor may depend on the reasons for the delay, the length of the delay, and, crucially, the prejudice caused by the delay. A good explanation may be necessary in circumstances where the defendant was well aware from an early stage of the proceedings that the plaintiff company is impecunious but only applies for security for costs late in the day, after the financially straitened plaintiff has already expended much of its limited resources preparing for a trial which may now never come. As Newnes JA put it in the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia decision of <span class="font-italic">Christou v Stanton Partners Australasia Pty Ltd </span>[2011] WASCA 176 (at [20]), a plaintiff “is entitled to know at the earliest opportunity, before it has committed substantial resources to pursuing the litigation, whether it will be required to provide security” and, importantly, “<span class="font-italic">[s]ecurity for costs is not a card that a defendant can keep up its sleeve and play at its convenience</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>The delay in the present case was substantial. As noted above at [15], the Respondents had raised the issue of security for costs on 18 March 2013, and then failed to make an application by the deadline of 28 March 2013. Security was only sought on 10 July 2014, which was more than a year later. A plaintiff in such circumstances may well have incurred costs and adopted certain positions under the fair assumption that the defendant, who knows of the plaintiff’s financial position, would not be seeking security. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>Returning to the point on intersecting cross-claims<span class="font-italic">, </span>Prakash J, in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Pricewaterhousecoopers and others</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 796 held (at [27]) that, even if there is some overlap between the defences and counterclaims, it does not mean that no security can be ordered, and the degree of overlap can be taken into account in considering both whether security should be ordered and the quantum of security to be ordered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">82 </span>Whilst <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane </span>referred to the overlap between the <span class="font-italic">defence </span>and the counterclaim, it is nevertheless well established that, for similar reasons, a close overlap between the <span class="font-italic">claim</span> and the counterclaim also militates against the granting of the security for costs. In this particular regard, the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">B</span><span class="font-italic"> J Crabtree (Insulation) Ltd v GPT Communication Systems Ltd </span>(1990) 59 BLR 43 (“<span class="font-italic">Crabtree</span>”), which was referred to in <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [20]), is instructive<span class="font-italic">. </span>As stated in an oft-cited passage by Bingham LJ (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Crabtree</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at 52–53): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is, however, necessary, as I think, to consider what the effect of an order for security in this case would be if security were not given. It would have the effect, as the defendants acknowledge, of preventing the plaintiffs pursuing their claim. It would, however, leave the defendants free to pursue their counterclaim. The plaintiffs could then defend themselves against the counterclaim although their own claim was stayed. <span class="font-italic">It seems quite clear and, indeed, was not I think in controversy </span><span class="font-italic">– that in the course of defending the counterclaim all the same matters would be canvassed as would be canvassed if the plaintiffs were to pursue their claim, but on that basis they would defend the claim and advance their own in a somewhat hobbled manner, and would be conducting the litigation (to change the metaphor) with one hand tied behind their back.</span> I have to say that that does not appeal to me on the facts of this case as a just or attractive way to oblige a party to conduct its litigation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Phillips for the defendants submits there would really be no problem because, if the defendants failed in their counterclaim and the plaintiffs’ case contrary to the counterclaim effectively succeeded, then the stay could be lifted and the plaintiffs could be given judgment.

This is an important, but not <span class="font-italic">determinative, </span>factor – for example, the prejudice of the plaintiff being limited in the continuing litigation may be offset by the possibility that there may be no continuing litigation at all (see <span class="font-italic">Autoweld</span> at [58]–[60]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>While the dismissal of a claim for want of security would not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>prevent a plaintiff from raising overlapping evidence that is relevant to his defence to the counterclaim (as we have emphasised earlier in this judgment), an unfair result may still be occasioned if the plaintiff succeeds in his defence by relying on the same issues he raised in his main claim, and after having “incurred all the costs required to bring that claim to judgment in the prosecution of his defence of the… counterclaim”, he would still be unable to secure judgment on his claim: see <span class="font-italic">Dumrul </span>at [18]<span class="font-italic"> </span>(cited above at [41]). The effect would merely be “to prevent the claimant from obtaining compensation or other remedies in excess of the remedies, if any, to which the counterclaimant may be entitled”: see <span class="font-italic">Civil Procedure </span><span class="font-italic">Volume 1</span> (I R Scott and Steven D Whitaker gen eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2014) at para 25.13.1.1. We would note that, in <span class="font-italic">Crabtree, </span>Bingham LJ suggested (in the passage set out above at [82]) that if the claim was merely <span class="font-italic">stayed, </span>the stay could be lifted if the plaintiffs’ case contrary to the counterclaim effectively succeeded, and judgment could be entered in favour of the plaintiffs’ own claim. However, as he noted, one might then ask what the point of the stay would therefore be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>One might also consider what would have happened if the shoe was on the other foot, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the Appellant had instead sought security for costs from the Respondents for the counterclaim. Even though security for costs may generally be ordered in respect of a counterclaim, a court will ordinarily not order security for costs in respect of a counterclaim that arises in respect of the same matter or transaction upon which the claim is founded if it is in substance the nature of a defence. We refer to Bingham LJ’s pithy statement of principle in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Hutchison Telephone (UK) Ltd v Ultimate Response Ltd </span>[1993] BCLC 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Hutchison</span>”) as follows (at 317):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The trend of authority makes it plain that, even though a counterclaiming defendant <span class="font-italic">may</span> technically be ordered to give security for the costs of a plaintiff against whom he counterclaims, such an order should not ordinarily be made if all the defendant is doing, in substance, is to defend himself. Such an approach is consistent with the general rule that security may not be ordered against a defendant. So the question may arise, as a question of substance, not formality or pleading: <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is the defendant simply defending himself, or is he going beyond mere self-defence and launching a cross-claim with an independent vitality of its own</span>?

Because the court is concerned to assess the substance of the matter, it is less concerned with more technical matters as to whether a claim is, or can be, pleaded as a set off or can only be asserted as a cross claim. Further, the court is not influenced, or certainly not much influenced by, the fact as to who first sued whom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>In our view, the existence of the counterclaim which would require the raising of numerous issues that coincide with the claim is a factor which may well have influenced the various procedural decisions below, if only the argument had been clearly made.

the corporate veil is usually only lifted where there is fraud or highly unconscionable conduct: see <span class="font-italic">Nanyang Law </span><span class="font-italic">LLC v Alphomega Research Group Ltd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1153 (at [5]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>The decisions referred to in the preceding paragraph are consistent with the holdings in the well-known English Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Metalloy Supplies Ltd v MA (UK) Ltd</span> [1997] 1 WLR 1613 (“<span class="font-italic">Metalloy</span>”) where it was stated by Millett LJ (as he then was) at 1620:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is not, however, sufficient to render a director liable for costs that he was a director of the company and caused it to bring or defend proceedings which he funded and which ultimately failed. Where such proceedings are bought [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] bona fide and for the benefit of the company, the company is the real plaintiff. If in such a case an order for costs could be made against a director in the absence of some impropriety or bad faith on his part, the doctrine of the separate liability of the company would be eroded and the principle that such orders should be exceptional would be nullified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span>Whilst impropriety or bad faith on the directors’ or shareholders’ part in causing the company to bring proceedings is an important factor in deciding whether they should be made personally liable for costs, we should emphasise that there is no <span class="font-italic">strict </span>requirement that such elements should be made out before an order can be made. Thus, where directors who were also guarantors of the debt of the company and who had conduct of the appeal pursued an appeal that the receiver of the company would not have taken to the bitter end and which was “was not an appeal which on any realistic objective assessment could be said to have good prospects of success”, it was appropriate to exercise the power to make the non-parties pay costs (in this case, from the date they funded the litigation): see the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Fulton Motors Limited v Toyota (GB) Limited</span> [2000] CP Rep 24. The lodestar is always whether it is just to do so in all the circumstances of the case concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>We now turn to the appropriateness of the decision below as to the costs of the main claim and the counterclaim. They raise slightly different issues and so, for clarity, we will deal with them separately.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Third party costs for the main claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">95 </span>To begin, we accept that the basic factors laid out in <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see above at [89(c)])<span class="font-italic"> </span>have been met. That, as we have explained, is not, however, the end of the story. The court must still be satisfied that it is <span class="font-italic">just </span>for costs to have been ordered against KC and CM for the main claim. We see no evidence that the main claim was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide, </span>or that the Appellant was not the proper plaintiff<span class="font-italic"> </span>or that KC and CM had acted improperly, although the Respondents’ counsel argues that KC had not handled himself well in the way he asked for the defence to be amended and trial dates to be vacated during the trial, and also alleges that the Appellant had deliberately supressed evidence. We do not think that this amounts to bad faith, especially considering that KC, whilst legally trained, is not a practising lawyer. Moreover, the Judge himself had found that “it could not be said that the plaintiff had conducted the litigation in an extravagant, disproportionate or oppressive manner” (see the GD at [30]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">96 </span>It should be reiterated that the Appellant failed on the main claim because of the failure to provide security for costs, and not upon the merits of the case as such. Whilst we see no reason in principle to prevent non-party costs from being awarded in such a situation, it is a factor that this court should take into account when looking at the justice of the case. Further, a director/shareholder should not typically be discouraged from acting responsibly<span class="font-italic"> </span>in assisting the company in getting compensation from those who may have wronged it and put it out of funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">97 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Metalloy</span>, the plaintiff company was in liquidation and it was unable to put up security for costs. The claim was thus dismissed and the liquidator was ordered to pay costs personally. This went to the English Court of Appeal which allowed the liquidator’s appeal against the decision for him to pay costs personally. As Waller LJ put it (at 1619):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… All that happened was that having successfully resisted an order for security for costs, on appeal the plaintiff company was ordered to provide security. That in fact forced the liquidator to discontinue. There was nothing exceptional in his conduct; there was nothing improper in his conduct; and no one in fact warned him that they were going to suggest otherwise. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">98 </span>It was also held in <span class="font-italic">Metalloy</span> (at 1619) that there is nothing unreasonable or irresponsible about continuing an action just because the company has not the funds to fight a trial. As Millett LJ stated (at 1620), “[i]t is obviously risky for a plaintiff to begin proceedings which he cannot afford to finish, but it is not unreasonable, still less improper, for him to do so”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">99 </span>In the present case, costs were awarded against non-party shareholders or directors, even though they were funding a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>claim, which had been belatedly dismissed for failure to provide security for costs, in circumstances where the impecunious corporate plaintiff is clearly the proper claimant and there has been no finding of any impropriety or bad faith from the aforesaid shareholders. We fail to see anything extraordinary about the facts on the present case that should have merited such an order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">100 </span>Indeed, as mentioned earlier (above at [80]), the Respondents’ application for security for costs came late in the day notwithstanding that they were aware of the Appellant’s parlous financial position from an early stage. They may have had their own reasons for adopting such an approach – in their written submission for SUM 3367 it was explained that the Respondent’s present solicitors only took over conduct of the matter on 4 June 2014 and there was an outstanding “unless order” application against the Respondents at the time – but the point is that the trial dates had already been fixed and, by the time the order was made, the AEICs had been exchanged. Much of the costs of getting up had already accrued. The result is that the Appellant, KC and CM found themselves in a position where, after expending much time and money to fund the litigation, they were deprived of the chance of having the main claim heard at the eleventh hour. To also order that KC and CM pay for the Respondents’ costs out of their own pockets when it was entirely within the Respondents’ right and power to have taken out a security for costs application at an early stage appears to us to be unfair, and militates against an award of non-party costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">101 </span>The Respondents submit that it is nevertheless fair for KC and CM to pay for the costs of the main claim since they had stated on affidavit that they have been funding the litigation and “[would] undertake any orders if any”. However, this undertaking was made in the context of resisting an order for security for costs, which the Appellant was ultimately unsuccessful in. We read the undertaking as a conditional one, premised on the main claim being continued. This is not a scenario where the Respondents had withdrawn the application for security for costs in reliance on that promise, and we have not seen any evidence that the Respondents have been prejudiced by the statement in the affidavit. What CM said in her affidavit had clearly not influenced the Respondents in how they conducted the litigation, or the court below in its various procedural decisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">102 </span>In the result, it was not in the interests of justice for costs to have been ordered against KC and CM for the main claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Third party costs for the counterclaim below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">103 </span>To begin, and as counsel for the Respondents acknowledges, different considerations may apply where a company is forced to defend a claim as compared to a case where the company itself is the claimant (see, for example<span class="font-italic">,</span> the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Goodwood Recoveries Ltd v Breen</span><span class="text-uppercase"> </span>[2006] 1 WLR 2723<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">104 </span>When a claim or a counterclaim is brought against a company that is short of funds, the directors and shareholders (or the liquidator, if it is already insolvent) will frequently be the ones who are <span class="font-italic">both </span>in control of the proceedings and funding the company in the litigation, resulting in costs being incurred. To the extent that the value of their shareholding or any other interest that they may have in the company (if any) is enhanced by a positive result, they also stand to benefit by a successful defence. The factors in <span class="font-italic">Dymocks </span>and <span class="font-italic">DB Trustees </span>will therefore frequently be made out. But does that mean that it is automatically just for non-party costs to be awarded?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">105 </span>Guidance can be found in the following passage in the pre-<span class="font-italic">Dymocks </span>decision of <span class="font-italic">Taylor</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Anor v Pace Developments Ltd</span> [1991] BCC 406, a decision of the English Court of Appeal (at 409):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The controlling director of a one-man company is inevitably the person who causes the costs to be incurred, in one sense, by causing the company to defend the proceedings. But it could not be right that in every such case he should be made personally liable for the costs, even if he knows that the company will not be able to meet the plaintiff's costs, should the company prove unsuccessful. That would be far too great an inroad on the principle of limited liability. I do not say that there may not be cases where a director may not [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] properly be liable for costs. Thus he might be made liable if the company's defence is not bona fide, as, for example, where the company has been advised that there is no defence, and the proceedings are defended out of spite, or for the sole purpose of causing the plaintiffs to incur irrecoverable costs. No doubt there will be other cases. But such cases must necessarily be rare. In the great majority of cases the directors of an insolvent company which defends proceedings brought against it should not be at personal risk of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">106 </span>Thus where the insolvent company’s defence is <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a court should lean against an award of such third party costs for the primary reason that it would not be in the public interest or, indeed, the interests of the other creditors, to deter the directors or shareholders from assisting it to pursue a legitimate defence even if it turns out, in the end, that the defence was not successful. But this is not a strict rule and the factual circumstances may vary widely from case to case. In the present case, we do not think it can be said that the defence to the counterclaim was not <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in that it was unsustainable or was for the sole purpose of causing the defendant to incur irrecoverable costs. We are satisfied that the Appellant was reasonable in defending the counterclaim, that it was in the interests of the Appellant and its creditors that this should be done, and the fact that it was seriously impeded from properly pursuing it below should not be held against it, or KC and CM. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate order of costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">107 </span>We are satisfied that the decision to order non-party costs below was inappropriate, and we therefore set it aside. The question remains as to what the costs order ought to be, both here and below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">108 </span>In so far as the order for costs for the main claim was concerned, there is no appeal against the main claim or the order that the Appellant itself should pay $20,000 as costs. We see no reason to disturb the Judge’s order in this respect, save for the part that KC and CM are to bear the costs of main claim jointly and severally with the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">109 </span>We have allowed the appeal on the counterclaim and ordered a retrial in the District Court (see above at [70]–[71]). In <span class="font-italic">Basil </span>(at [83]–[86]), this court found itself in a similar position. In that case, it was found that the retrial had to be ordered in that case largely because of the conduct of the respondents <span class="font-italic">via </span>their “misguided procedural strategies”; however, the appellant’s counsel did not assist the court in the way that someone of his experience would be expected to. In our judgment, the position appears to be similar here, but, in the interests of fairness, we will hear the parties on the issue of the costs below and on appeal with respect to the counterclaim at a date to be fixed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">110 </span>For the reasons set out above, we allow the appeal and order a retrial for the counterclaim in the District Court. The Judge’s decision to order non-party costs is set aside. The usual consequential orders will apply. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not affect the result in the main claim which has already been dismissed (and for which no appeal was taken to this court), except that the costs of the main claim (which was fixed at $20,000) shall be borne by the Appellant alone. Finally, we will hear the parties on the issue of the costs below and on appeal with respect to the counterclaim at a date to be fixed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin     Andrew Phang Boon Leong  Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Judge of Appeal    Judge of Appeal   Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Prakash Pillai, Koh Junxiang and Clement Ong Yuan Kun (Clasis LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Jordan Tan and Keith Han (Cavenagh Law LLP) for the respondents.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
