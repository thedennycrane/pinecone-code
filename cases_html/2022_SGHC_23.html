The third claim is dismissed because the plaintiff was indeed guilty of insubordination and misconduct justifying summary termination of his employment. The fourth claim is dismissed because it is bereft of particulars and evidence and is completely baseless. The fifth claim is dismissed because the plaintiff failed to comply with an express contractual condition precedent for him to receive the post-termination monthly indemnity. The sixth and final claim is dismissed because there was no breach of any implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the plaintiff’s employment contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendants bring a counterclaim against the plaintiff seeking relief for his breach of his obligations of confidentiality.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I therefore take it that the plaintiff’s share of the profit on Fund II, by whatever formula it may be calculated, is zero. As such, even if I were to decide this first claim entirely in the plaintiff’s favour, he would be entitled only to nominal damages. In that sense, determining the first claim could be said to be of little substantive importance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Despite this, I will proceed to determine the proper construction of the phrase “2.5% carry”. I do this for two reasons. First, that issue of construction is fundamental to the resolution of the plaintiff’s remaining claims. It is impossible to assess the quality of the parties’ conduct after August 2014 without forming a view on whose position on the construction of “2.5% carry” was correct. Second, even if it is correct that the plaintiff is entitled only to nominal damages, that would still mean a victory for him on this claim, albeit a technical one. That could have a significant bearing on the award of the costs of this claim, and perhaps even of the entire action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I therefore analyse the first claim only in order to determine the proper construction of the phrase “2.5% carry”. In my view, for the reasons which follow, the LCA Group’s construction is undoubtedly correct and the plaintiff’s is fundamentally wrong. The phrase “2.5% carry” means 2.5% of the LCA Group’s share of the profit on Fund II and not 2.5% of the “gross profits” on Fund II.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The contextual approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The parties are in agreement that I must construe the phrase “2.5% carry” using the contextual approach. The contextual approach requires me to ascertain the parties’ objective intention at the time they entered into the contract, taking as my starting point the parties’ text and construing that text in light of its context, provided that that context is clear, obvious and known to both parties: <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [125], [128]–[129]; <span class="font-italic">Crescendas Bionics Pte Ltd v Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd</span> [2019] SGHC 4 at [104].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The text</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I start with the text, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the phrase “2.5% carry”. Construing this phrase requires me to construe its three aspects: (a) the meaning of “2.5%”; (b) the meaning of “carry”; and (c) the arithmetic relationship between “2.5%” and “carry”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">2.5%</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 There can be no dispute as to the meaning of “2.5%”. It is a fraction expressed as a percentage. Expressing a fraction as a percentage is a device to make it easier to compare fractions with different denominators. The symbol “%” indicates merely that the figure preceding it must be divided by one hundred to arrive at the decimal equivalent of the fraction. Expressing 2.5% as a decimal therefore simply requires dividing 2.5 by 100. Thus, 2.5% can be expressed as a decimal and then as an irreducible fraction as follows: <img alt="Math Equation" class="img-fluid" src="data:image/Png;base64, 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"/></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Carry</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On the meaning of “carry”, the expert evidence on both sides was consistent. “Carry” or “carried interest”

A fund’s profit is what remains after its costs have been paid, after investors have received their capital back and after investors have received an agreed rate of return on that capital.

A fund manager proposes a private equity fund to investors. The fund is to have a lifespan of exactly one year. The fund manager is entitled to retain 20% of the fund’s profit at the end of that year. But the fund manager will have no right to retain that 20% unless investors are first repaid 100% of their capital plus a rate of return on that capital at 8% per annum over the lifespan of the fund. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Now assume that the fund manager receives capital of $100 on 1 January 2022 from investors. He invests the $100 on the same day in a single investment. From 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, the investment generates no income and the fund manager makes no distributions to investors. On 31 December 2022, the fund manager sells that single investment for $238. The fund’s total costs over its one-year lifespan amount to $30, all of which are unpaid. That $30 includes the fund manager’s fees and expenses and the costs of acquiring, holding and selling that single investment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On 1 Jan 2023, therefore, the fund manager holds $238. He distributes that $238 as follows. First, he pays the fund’s costs of $30. That leaves $208. Second, he returns to the investors $100, being the capital they paid in at inception. That leaves $108. Third, he pays investors $8.00, being the agreed rate of return over the one year on their capital of $100. That leaves $100. Out of that $100, the fund manager pays $80 to investors as their agreed share of the fund’s profit. The fund manager retains the remaining $20 as the fund manager’s agreed share of the fund’s profit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this example, the total amount which investors receive from the fund on 1 January 2023 is $188 ($100 + $8 + $80). That is equivalent to investors earning a return of 0.88 times their initial investment of $100. This fund would then be said to have generated a multiple of 1.88x for investors. That means that its investors’ total pay-out at the end of the fund’s lifespan ($188) is 1.88 times the capital they paid in on the fund’s inception ($100).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The 20% share of the fund’s profit which the fund manager retains in the final step is what is known in the industry as the “carry” or the “carried interest”. The 8% rate of return which the fund manager had to earn for investors in order to be entitled to the carry is known as the “hurdle rate”. These two rates – 8% for the hurdle rate and 20% for the carry – are industry standards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The fund in this example would be said to have generated a carry of $20 for the fund manager. It is customary in the industry in certain contexts to view and refer to the carry as a “carried interest pool” comprising 20 points. In my example, therefore $1 of carry in the fund manager’s hands represents $1 out of $100 or 1% of the fund’s profit. The same $1 is also viewed as representing one point out of 20 points in the carried interest pool, or 5% of the carry. This is what gives rise to the factor of five between the parties’ competing constructions of the phrase “2.5% carry”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Arithmetic relationship between “2.5%” and “carry”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 All that remains now is to construe the arithmetic relationship between “2.5%” and “carry” expressed by the phrase “2.5% carry”. The plaintiff submits that the relationship is one of <span class="font-italic">division</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>The LCA Group submits that the relationship is one of <span class="font-italic">multiplication</span>. The plaintiff’s construction would, in my example, entitle him to $2.50, leaving $17.50 in the carried interest pool. The LCA Group’s construction, in my example, would entitle him only to $0.50, leaving $19.50 in the carried interest pool.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I have no hesitation in rejecting the plaintiff’s submission.

Further, insofar as this submission construes “carry” as being equivalent to “gross profits”, or what I have called simply profit, the expert evidence on both sides is consistent that that is not the meaning of “carry” in the private equity industry. “Carry” means the fund manager’s share of a fund’s profit, customarily 20%, and not the entirety of the fund’s profit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The alternative is that the plaintiff’s submission amounts to construing the symbol “%” as meaning “points of” such that “2.5% carry” means “2.5 points of carry”. There is no basis for construing the symbol “%” in this way. It denotes, without any ambiguity, a fraction or a ratio and not an absolute number. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In my view, “2.5% carry” is the linguistic equivalent of “2.5% <span class="font-italic">of</span> carry”. The natural reading of the phrase “2.5% carry” is that it holds the word “of”, unstated but understood, between “2.5%” and “carry”. That unstated preposition indicates to me nothing but the arithmetic relationship of multiplication. Thus, in my view, the phrase “2.5% carry” properly construed means that the plaintiff was entitled contractually to 2.5% <span class="font-italic">of</span> the carry on Fund II. That is the arithmetic equivalent of 0.5% of Fund II’s profit: <img alt="Math Equation" class="img-fluid" src="data:image/Png;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAa8AAAAsCAYAAADSODfDAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAAkwSURBVHhe7ZyBldQqGIW3GbuwCWuwBVuwAzuwAiuwARuwARuwgHnv27d3/eUBgUBmwuZ+53BmhpA/cCHckGT36WaMMcYshs3LGGPMcvxlXl+/fr29e/fu9vT0dPv8+fNL7h/Ij+nqrKpXqd7fvn17reuXL19eck0N6aUkrOV+trTTNiVzTV57/sePH7f379/ffv/+ffv582d2UHz48OHlm1lVr1q9+U7er1+/nr/zaeqU+tha7mdLO89DBrKXLUxsDJoUD5o8q+oV642pxfrynStgUyfXx9ZyPy3a5TQ31yNrXp8+fcqebFyxM9mRcrfJrsqqesV65yYN3+7aJtfH1nI/Ldp5HjLwP/NiMLBkr8EynmcmDLSrs6peab2pG5OCYNL4/v37yy+zRexja7mfHu08D12bv8yLKxxNaDzUZ1CQxwDi+8ePH59vNZEYNFuT9ltnVb1y9dYtRPKZFPjOpylT6mNruZ+Sdp6HTMqreTEAGCgxxcmYARSX6+RfmVX1KtUbuIWovNxtUPM3tT62lvvJaed5aC7oSFqZ7DOvFWFSZhLWRGzeBurTmMxcmMRSjVef2O4JK8BUv3usBjF2zJtP6lCCvqRcTFrFRhQv1/fEZ1vtOLPZGpd3NS8aXuvUVMwWuB/OrQMSHaIrsrfAEXodzew606/0J1fbsX/vMTmcldkax5UOGmtlwws9b5HZ+hEr6qdxio4cazbEJDYJQ+EcqR2L9lAfGZdSNAKegVNvPimbGhj5pB5Gdd4al3ed5TEaDp5rEBWicj2ocTy3EXzvjXNWZut1D2bXWfF0YvLJycpzj6tyxLhgnzg5cR6VjrE6R+iHdnE/YnOMODfNQn2jcwKjqR1L5lUjxkMDzE2oLdreygyda+Py7ksUGU5skBrSIw5liZNeDRA3Ci+0JK4lypyNWXrdk5l1TicF0NVtjlX7uZeZGutcYrIRmvBaro5zGsd0Rr1n6gfsl85FxKf9KaOaMfbTizeOXzontsyL7VwQCtVBEDuOjR5GdN4alw+5vxYbtHfAIC4xWvcbHTCPZIZe92ZWndmPvhFbV5kr93MvszTWFXKEeGlejpX1nqUf+xAnGn2MnTKqGXEpE8G4ogFFNOHTz+zHuRPbWTMvPvV2J/vxu1ejvTpvjct/P/+7pzgrtaIG7R0wj7x1lLZ5JLUyold6zJHUw2gfR6PiBCMe/b43Xg+xzY9IrYxqDJpQ0JikCYLY9yS2fzS1MkM/xZB+TPD8RscjILbMRWBepXbTLhkPiXOIsvG5Fr/VfupNebZTlk+t9kjR6FrZo/PWuOybjSbCEpuKRNFaoTz7IXArNFidV0oS5YyM6PUoRuusAc+Jo0Sf12Kt3s+9zBgXTEYkacwkwWTRgs+rP6sB6ccEX2vzqGYcizIRjstE3wLtJAZtF9SZGNKDMvzmfGPFFGPLUHrYo/PWuHyIedExNGLvcp0GsH+PgKMD5pGM6vUIZtRZ+/Wwcj/3MkNjrW5HnmnkNI7prHrP0A+YYKMRbDGqGfVM7zoxuad5NWQIgnZrdcaYYDzo3GOejWX5TrlW9ujcMi7vbl6xIaJ34JQaRv6ewXdmZuh1b2bVmRg9k8KVmKUxExZx3tp5s8Us/difOHvNfw9xdQR88ps2AfMg5qKLe/LJEypfMiBtlzY582q967VX55Zx+WpeHCR1bh04bWgpfws6mH1iQ4Qa1AoCUp6YiEs9iB076UhW0wtWqrP6k31qA/hoZmh2Vo05V1g1lGI9ghl6bzFLP8YldSVW62Q+A5kL9aTd9GHUjPkwasJcqdWhyrNv6bxCg6gn8dhHsK+MscZenVvH5bN5UVFSdFfQzgTju4yhlL8FYtUq0yKIIBadQZ1JdF4U/EhW1Gu1OqtfSbV4RzJLs978LWZpzOQvjc+wwl1tjBJD+qV1PhraoNt8mEQEHchXO/hNGemblo+wD8ZB/AhGwxzba+57dG4dl68rLwLFDkh/852gpfyrsaJeK9b50YxqZo37GNXbjIGGOcORWZJSY3sUXeYlN8/lX40V9Vqxzo9mVDNr3Meo3uY6VM0rLg/ZxnKzlH81VtRrxTo/mlHNrHEfo3qb61A0L5aGuXvKpfyrsaJe7uN+RjWzxn14jJpWns2Lh2J6u4OrGQYEcP+TPFK8n1zKvwor6uU+7meWZr35V8Vj1PTwuvIyxhhjVsHmZYwxZjlsXsYYY5bD5vUG4cH1WR5e89yCh/B+mG6MmYnN66TwAJq/W+GTN6tKYAqUi4m3tTCMiOLlTIT4bKsdpxdiUQ8evPNAnYfxJagT9Y3JZmeMqWHzOhlM+kz4JAyFt6/4XjIWJnrMQcalFCd/jAMj4ZOyqTGQXzOXPfBvZPTKM39/U3sbjG16aywaHjGMMSaHzetkpP9NGaPhd+kff8q8asR46T/d5LZe3D4D1bnnj0YxrGig0kGvSxtjTMTmdQC6RVdLpZUIK4/0v2ozsWsVk7JlXmxn9SZ0fEHsPf+ZgLikFMwGg5R55cqkYJyp2aldLfsbY66HzesARsyLCZvtEYwrGlBEkzwTP/ul/ziT7SXz4hOjpDz78XtrBaZbfJiebu/F1RGrJ/2hac6Ic1B3ykdkgMYYk8Ozw8lgwpa5CEygNJFH4yHJOOJzLX7LlDAFyrOdsnzKZEglkwQZZTReDCx9NkWcNK8GZYlDfJKMq2Twxhhj8zqAI1ZeTO4tYFLEiM+PMBNikCcj4zcmxqopxpaJ5GBbupKS8UU4BrFbwTBJxCJhXqU6GGMM2LwOYMS8Wg2ihkxAxNUZKy1u08mwMIlYlu+Uy5FbDaVGpRdAWl+02PNyhzHG2LxORlwdgVZSMg0me8xFKxPyyRMqXzIgbZe55Mwrt2qSKcUVEeXIi8fnuOS1ohhqrzHGtGDzOhkyF1ZGGAG30+KqC/Ngu8wJs6EMpqfy7FsyA27JRWMjHvsI9o0GFVFd2C6TSldi1Kd1lYjpEZM4rSs1Y4wBm9cJwXh0my+9nZauvPitNw1z5SMyqtTYdKtSL06UwGAog0GVnkthRLmVWw6Mj1ik+IzOGGO2sHldCMwit8KRWZJKK7YWME7MK95GNMaYI7B5mSmwCtMKzhhjjsbmZabArT9uW46s3IwxphWblzHGmMW43f4BNcAngixB94kAAAAASUVORK5CYII="/>.

Mr Goodson agreed that, in my example, the phrase “50% carry” would mean $10 and that the phrase “10% carry” would mean $2. He then had to accept that the phrase “2.5% carry” had to mean $0.50 and not $2.50 because “2.5% carry” had to be less than “10% carry”.

Mr Ong was the LCA Group’s Chief Financial Officer at the material time. Mr Ong’s email is the earliest occasion in the evidence before me on which any of the parties used the phrase “2.5% carry”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In his estimate, Mr Ong assumed that Fund II, like its predecessor Fund I, would raise US$635.5m from investors and would generate a multiple of 2.5x or 250%. That means that Fund II would earn enough to return 100% of the investors’ capital to them plus an additional 150% of their capital. On those assumptions, he projected that “2.5% carry” would translate to US$4.77m for the plaintiff:

We are expecting to raise a larger fund in the next round and hence the number is expected to be larger.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Mr Ong does not set out in this email how he arrived at the estimate of US$4.77m as the plaintiff’s share of the carry on Fund II. But Mr Ong was a witness at trial and explains his working in his affidavit of evidence in chief. A 2.5x fund which raised US$635.5m in investors’ capital would leave the fund manager holding 2.5 times US$635.5m or US$1,588.75m at the end of the fund’s lifespan. On Mr Ong’s assumptions, the investors’ capital of US$635.5m is first returned to investors out of that sum. That leaves US$953.25m, being 1.5 times US$635.5m. The fund’s costs and hurdle rate have been accounted for in the selection of 2.5x as the multiple and need not be deducted separately. The carry would therefore be 20% of US$953.25m or US$190.65m. The plaintiff’s share, being “2.5% carry”, would be 2.5% of US$190.65m or US$4,766,250. Rounded off to two decimal places, that is Mr Ong’s figure of US$4.77m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The plaintiff’s own expert, Mr Carr, accepted that, on these assumptions, the estimate of US$4.77m in Mr Ong’s email was an estimate of 2.5% of the carry on Fund II and not an estimate of 2.5% of the “gross profit” or the profit of Fund II.

All of this is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s case as to context and a “shared understanding” of the meaning of the phrase “2.5% carry” in the May 2012 Letter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Industry norms</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I am also satisfied that an award to the plaintiff of a share of the carry on Fund II of 12.5% would have been wholly contrary to industry norms. The plaintiff’s case is that his share of the carry on Fund II was worth US$37.5m. Alternatively, calculating the plaintiff’s share of the carry according to the plaintiff’s formula but based on Mr Ong’s assumptions in his June 2011 email would yield five times Mr Ong’s US$4.77m figure or US$23.83m. The evidence before me establishes that it would have been wholly contrary to industry norms for the LCA Group to have awarded a share of the carry of that order of magnitude to someone with the plaintiff’s experience in private equity and for someone performing the plaintiff’s role in the LCA Group.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The plaintiff had no private equity experience when he accepted employment with the LCA Group. It is true that he is highly educated and holds a Masters in Business Administration from Insead, a leading international business school. It is also true that he had held very senior executive positions before joining the LCA Group. But it is equally true that his exposure to the private equity industry before then was either purely academic (as part of his business school curriculum) or from the other side (as a senior executive of a private equity fund’s investee company).

The plaintiff’s expert, Mr Carr, is an expert on executive compensation in the private equity industry. His expert report cites and exhibits a paper by Ms Amanda Persaud, a partner in the asset management group of a Wall Street law firm. The title of Ms Persaud’s paper is “Private Equity Carried Interest Arrangements: A Business Perspective”. Both Mr Goodson and Mr Carr were cross-examined on Ms Persaud’s paper. Her paper contains a statement of industry norms for the allocation of a share of carry to a list of recipient classes. Each recipient class in her list typically deserves and receives a smaller share of the carry than the class above it. Operations professionals such as the plaintiff are in the lowest class. The plaintiff was at best in the lower tier of the second recipient class or, more likely, in the third recipient class. As Ms Persaud says:

</div> That range is perfectly consistent with a 2.5% share of the carry. The plaintiff’s claim to a 12.5% share of the carry is outside the range by an order of magnitude.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 None of this evidence was satisfactorily addressed by the plaintiff’s expert witnesses. Mr Goodson was not an expert on executive compensation and did not address the issue at all. Mr Carr included market data from a different market with different norms, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, North America, and addressed the issue from the perspective of a loss of compensation. In any event, Mr Carr’s market data on compensation in the Asia Pacific region does not support a share of the carry of the order of magnitude of 12.5%.

He therefore preferred a higher base salary and a higher bonus target over a higher share of carry. That is why cl 3.1 of the February 2012 Contract weighted the plaintiff’s remuneration package towards salary and bonus rather than carry, giving him a fixed salary of US$400,000 per annum and an annual performance bonus targeting 100% of his fixed salary (see [29] above). The evidence at trial established that the plaintiff’s base remuneration placed him as high as the 75th percentile for executives in the private equity industry in the Asia Pacific region.

If the plaintiff has to rely on his misrepresentation claim, that means that the LCA Group’s representations have been falsified in that the plaintiff has been found not to be entitled to “2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II” but only to 2.5% of the carry on Fund II. The first defendant made these representations fraudulently, knowing them to be false, or recklessly, not caring whether they be true or false.

</div> This representation says nothing about the quantum of his share of the carry. The second written representation says simply that the plaintiff will be “awarded 2.5% carry” on Fund II. It says nothing about what “2.5% carry” means or how it is to be calculated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The plaintiff claims that he understood both written representations to mean that the LCA Group would award him some part of the “gross profits” of Fund II, not of its “net profits”. According to the plaintiff’s use of the terms “gross profits” and “net profits”, the fund in my example (see [44]–[46] above) generated “gross profits” of $100 and “net profits” of $20. The plaintiff’s case is therefore that he understood the two written representations to mean that he was entitled to 2.5% of the $100 ($2.50) and not to 2.5% of the $20 ($0.50).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 But neither of the written representations uses the words “gross” or “profits” or the phrase “gross profits”. This is an objective fact. The plaintiff had no alternative but to accept this fact in cross-examination.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiff’s use of “gross profits” in pleading and presenting his case is contrived and incorrect. The experts are agreed that it is customary in the private equity industry to refer to what the fund manager retains after he has paid 80% of a fund’s profits to investors as “the carry” or “the carried interest”. These were the only terms which the LCA Group used in its written representations to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 At best, all that the LCA Group represented to the plaintiff in the two written representations is that he would be entitled to 2.5% of the carry on Fund II. At best, and correctly understood, the two representations did not mean that the plaintiff would be entitled to 2.5% of the “gross profits” on Fund II, as the plaintiff has pleaded.

That is because he relies on it not only as a fraudulent misrepresentation but also as evidence of a shared understanding forming part of the admissible context for construing the phrase “2.5% carry”. On the plaintiff’s case, this phone call was the earliest time that anybody on behalf of the LCA Group made the specific representation to the plaintiff on which his entire misrepresentation case rests. One would expect it to be the cornerstone of the plaintiff’s positive case on both misrepresentation and breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Despite this, the plaintiff did not plead this representation anywhere in his original statement of claim. The plaintiff pleaded it belatedly in his reply, and even then only to meet the LCA Group’s plea in its defence and counterclaim that Mr Ong’s June 2011 email and other contemporaneous documentary evidence showed that the first defendant promised the plaintiff nothing more than “2.5% carry”.

He did nothing of the sort. From in or around June 2011 (when the third defendant allegedly made this representation) to June 2015 (when the plaintiff’s employment was terminated) all the way up to July 2016 (when the plaintiff first pleaded this representation in his reply and then incorporated it by amendment into his statement of claim), he had made no reference whatsoever to this representation, whether by himself, through his solicitors or through Spencer Stuart, his interface with the LCA Group in 2011, and whether informally in correspondence or formally in his pleadings.

</div> That would mean that the plaintiff accepted the remuneration package in that offer – including the award of “2.5% carry” in those very words – even though he knew: (a) that the third defendant had, more than six months earlier, expressly disavowed Mr Ong’s written representation that the plaintiff would be entitled to “2.5% carry” estimated to be worth US$4.77m; and (b) that that disavowal was purely oral and was not in writing or even evidenced by writing. There is no record of the plaintiff making any attempt to have the third defendant’s earlier representation recorded in the LCA Group’s written offer of February 2012 or indeed anywhere else in writing before he accepted the offer. There is also no record of the plaintiff himself restating the third defendant’s representation in any pre-contractual correspondence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In fact, in July 2011, the plaintiff informed Spencer Stuart that the first defendant’s package was acceptable, making no mention whatsoever of this alleged oral representation.

</div> It appears therefore that the plaintiff would have been happy, if he had been minded to accept the LCA Group’s offer in July 2011, to proceed on the basis that Mr Ong’s July 2011 email was the definitive word on the plaintiff’s share of Fund II’s carry.

A share of the carry on Fund II of this order of magnitude is all the more uncommercial given the plaintiff’s case that he was not expected to invest any of his personal funds in Fund II. As the LCA Group puts it, that means that the plaintiff’s case today is that it agreed in February 2012 that the plaintiff should bear none of the risks of Fund II and reap only the rewards of Fund II. That is contrary to the inherent probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The plaintiff says that the third defendant offered him a share of the carry of this order of magnitude in July 2011 because he wanted the LCA Group’s offer to be competitive with Zovi.com’s offer. That offer included participation in an employee’s share option plan. On this point, I accept the defendant’s expert witnesses’ evidence: a share of the carry of a fund to be launched and managed by a well-established and successful private equity fund manager, such as the LCA Group, carries far less risk, and is therefore far more valuable, than an option to be awarded shares in a start-up company with no track record and with no certainty that the shares can ever be monetised, let alone that the shares will have value or appreciate in value over time.

This excludes statements as to the future. A representor’s statement that a state of affairs will come about in the future is either a promise or a prediction. It is a promise when that state of affairs is within the promisor’s control. It is a prediction when that state of affairs is outside the promisor’s control.

</div>
</div>
</div> For the purposes of this section of my analysis, I will assume, contrary to the plaintiff’s concession and my findings, that the LCA Group actually did make this representation to him in writing and orally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 This representation is not a statement of fact. It is in substance a promise. That is because it is a statement by the LCA Group that it would bring about in the future a state of affairs. That state of affairs is that the LCA Group would pay the plaintiff “2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II”. If falsified, this representation will amount to broken promise. It cannot be a failed prediction. That is because what the LCA Group pays to the plaintiff out of the profits of Fund II in the future is not outside the control of the LCA Group. I therefore need say nothing further about failed predictions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 A broken promise gives rise to a viable claim in fraudulent misrepresentation only if the representor had no intention of fulfilling the promise at the time he made it. This is not an exception to the rule that an actionable misrepresentation must be a statement of fact. That is because, in truth, it is not the broken promise which is the actionable misrepresentation. The actionable misrepresentation is the implicit representation which accompanies every promise: that the promisor genuinely intends to honour his promise. If the promisor has no such intent, the promise is made fraudulently. That is because the implicit representation which accompanies the promise is false. That is so even if, by some happenstance, the subject of the promise ultimately eventuates. Another way of putting the same point, albeit somewhat inaccurately, is that a broken promise is actionable in misrepresentation if and only if the representor makes the promise having no intention of fulfilling it, and the representor is in that sense fraudulent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Therefore, contrary to the LCA Group’s submission, classifying the alleged representation as a promise rather than a statement of fact is not in itself a ground on which to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim in fraudulent misrepresentation. All that that means is that this claim cannot succeed simply by the plaintiff showing that the LCA Group has broken its promise. The plaintiff can nevertheless succeed by proving fraud, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that the LCA Group represented to the plaintiff that it would pay him“2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II” with no intention of keeping the promise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s own case is that the first defendant was not fraudulent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The plaintiff’s own evidence is fatal to his plea of fraud. He readily accepted in cross-examination that the third defendant and Mr Piette fully intended that the LCA Group would keep its promise to pay the plaintiff “2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II” when they made the representations to him in June 2011 and February 2012. That necessarily means that he accepts that the implicit representation which accompanied this alleged promise (see [128] above) was true at the time the LCA Group made this promise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 As the plaintiff explained in cross-examination, the only case he advances on fraud is that the third defendant and Mr Piette changed their mind in August 2014 and decided to cause the LCA Group to break the promise to pay him “2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II”. The plaintiff asserts further that they did so in order to put pressure on him because they were unhappy about his whistleblowing:

In August, they restated that position, and when we go further into my whistleblowing, I can explain the context and why I believe that’s so. So I don’t believe that there was anything false mentioned in 2011 and 2012.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: …Mr Mehra, what Mr Tan is saying is: from what I understand of your evidence, you are saying that you accept that in 2011, the third defendant was telling you the truth as to his future intention, and in 2014, he was lying to you about what he had told you in 2011. If he was telling you the truth in 2011 and you joined L Capital in 2012, and then he lied after you had joined, then you would not have been induced to join by a lie.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A:  Your Honour, that is absolutely correct.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: All right, thank you.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The plaintiff’s answers in cross-examination are not admissible evidence on whether the third defendant and Mr Piette made the pleaded representation fraudulently. That question turns on whether the third defendant and Mr Piette intended at that time to cause the LCA Group to keep its promise to pay the plaintiff “2.5% of the gross profits of Fund II”. The plaintiff is not, of course, a mind reader. He can therefore have no personal knowledge of their state of mind at the material time. He is therefore incapable of giving direct evidence as to the third defendant’s and Mr Piette’s state of mind at the material time within the meaning of s 62(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 But the plaintiff is not merely a witness in this litigation. He is also one of the litigants. I must take it that he presents his case to the court as an honest litigant. It is therefore not open to the plaintiff to advance a position in this action – whether in his pleadings, in his affidavit of evidence in chief, in his counsel’s cross-examination of the defendants’ witnesses or in his submissions – which is contrary to facts which the plaintiff accepts to be true. That is so even if the plaintiff himself is unable to give admissible evidence as to the truth of those facts, for example, as in this case, because they are outside his personal knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The passages from the plaintiff’s cross-examination which I have cited at [131] and [132] above show that the plaintiff believes to this day that the third defendant and Mr Piette made the representation to him honestly, not fraudulently. The plaintiff therefore could not have hoped to succeed in his plea of fraud. He should have never made the plea, let alone pursued it at trial in an attempt to secure judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff was not induced by the representation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I also do not accept that the first defendant’s alleged representation induced the plaintiff to leave his employment with Zovi.com and take up employment with the first defendant. Again, for the purpose of this analysis, I assume that the LCA Group did make a misrepresentation to the plaintiff as alleged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 First of all, in the passage from his cross-examination which I have cited at [132] above, the plaintiff himself accepted that he was not induced to accept employment with the LCA Group by any pre-contractual deception by the LCA Group. That is fatal to the plaintiff’s case in inducement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Second, I accept LCA Group’s case that the plaintiff was asked to leave Zovi.com in early 2012 and that that was why he reinitiated the discussions with the LCA Group about potential employment. The evidence before me shows that the plaintiff was, by early 2012, in “settlement” negotiations with Zovi.com. The negotiations were over a “severance package” of six months’ salary with the possibility of extension if he had been unable within those six months to find employment or to start a business of his own.

</div>
</div> Further, the plaintiff expressed concern in contemporaneous emails to Zovi.com about how his departure would be publicised. That would have been an unlikely concern if he were leaving voluntarily for a better employment opportunity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I therefore find that the plaintiff accepted the LCA Group’s offer of employment in February 2012 because that was the best alternative he then had, after having been asked to leave Zovi.com. As such, I find that he would have accepted the LCA Group’s offer of employment with or without the alleged representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Finally, returning to my actual findings thus far, insofar as the plaintiff was induced by anything to accept the first defendant’s offer of employment, the true and operative inducement was, at best, his own misunderstanding of what the phrase “2.5% carry” meant. That misunderstanding did not originate from any act or omission on the part of the LCA Group or its representatives. Nor was it a reasonable misunderstanding of the representations which the LCA Group actually made to him. His misunderstanding was entirely subjective, entirely self-engendered and entirely unreasonable. The LCA Group cannot bear any responsibility in fact or in law if the plaintiff was induced to accept the LCA Group’s offer of employment by his own subjective, self-engendered and unreasonable misunderstanding of the terms of his remuneration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 For all of these reasons, I find that the plaintiff has failed to establish the element of inducement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff has not proven that he suffered any loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Finally, I accept the LCA Group’s submission that the plaintiff has failed to prove that he suffered any loss as a result of the alleged misrepresentations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The plaintiff claims that his reliance on the first defendant’s misrepresentation caused him to suffer loss of US$75m or US$3m. That is the value which the plaintiff ascribes to the shares in Zovi.com which he would have received under its employee stock option plan (“ESOP”) if he had remained with Zovi.com instead of accepting employment with the LCA Group in February 2012.

His true complaint is the LCA Group broke its promise to pay him 2.5% of the “gross profits” of Fund II. Protecting the plaintiff’s interest in that promise, assuming for the moment that it was made, is entirely and properly the domain of the law of contract. I have already rejected the plaintiff’s contractual claim for 2.5% of Fund II’s gross profits as wholly misconceived. It would subvert the law of contract to allow the plaintiff to pursue, let alone succeed, in an alternative claim in tort based on the LCA Group’s breach of the very same promise. His true complaint is not even actionable in tort.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Claim 3: termination in breach of contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The plaintiff’s third claim is a claim that the LCA Group terminated his employment in breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The applicable law is not in dispute. An employment contract is treated in Singapore law like any other contract.

Misconduct is conduct which destroys the relationship of trust and confidence which underlies a contract between employer and employee and which thereby renders the employment relationship untenable (<span class="font-italic">Piattchanine (HC)</span> at [253]–[254] and [260]; cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Piattchanine </span><span class="font-italic">(CA) </span>at [50] and [53]). One type of conduct which will have this effect is insubordination. Insubordination is the wilful disobedience of a reasonable and lawful command from a superior officer (<span class="font-italic">Piattchanine </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> at [52(b)], [55]). Disobedience is wilful if it is done “intentionally, knowingly and purposely, without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly, or inadvertently.”

That additional ground is that, between March 2015 and June 2015, the plaintiff used his LCA Group email account to send emails containing material confidential to the LCA Group to his personal email account without the LCA Group’s consent. The LCA Group did not include this ground in the termination letter because it discovered the underlying facts only afterwards, in April 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 In response, the plaintiff asserts that the LCA Group terminated his employment in breach of the June 2015 Contract on two grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, none of the conduct which the LCA Group now complains of amounts to a breach of his employment contract at all. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, even if he was in breach of his employment contract, the LCA Group failed to issue him a written notice of deficiency and failed to allow him an opportunity to cure the breach as it was required to do by the express terms of his employment contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The gist of the plaintiff’s case is that the LCA Group has contrived the allegation of insubordination in order to hide its true reason for terminating the plaintiff’s employment: to “suppress the plaintiff’s whistleblowing and [to] cover up [Mr] Piette’s mistake of informing the plaintiff that he would be entitled to US$37.5 million” as his share of the carry on Fund II.

Arising from the plaintiff’s allegations, LVMH appointed KPMG to conduct an internal review. KPMG found no wrongdoing.

</div> The plaintiff’s whistleblowing was entirely without merit. Further, I accept that the whistleblowing was a mere contrivance, designed to create leverage to be deployed in his dispute over his share of the carry on Fund II. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In any event, the plaintiff’s whistleblowing is and was, both factually and legally distinct from his obligations under his employment contract in three senses. First, his status as a whistleblower gave him no legal basis on which to disregard his contractual obligations under his employment contract and gave him no legal excuse for any breach of his employment contract. Although the plaintiff asserted this legal proposition in his cross-examination, his submissions cite no authority for it. Second, I accept the fourth defendant’s evidence that the LCA Group kept entirely separate the plaintiff’s performance or non-performance of his contractual obligations under his employment contract from the action it took to investigate his allegations of wrongdoing.

</div> The third defendant denies ever giving any such blanket approval. I accept the third defendant’s evidence. The plaintiff’s evidence is contrary to the inherent probabilities. No superior officer would give a subordinate blanket approval to absent himself from his primary place of work as and when the employee chose to do so. That is especially the case when the other place of work is not just in another city but in another country. In the absence of specific approval from the LCA Group, it was a breach of contract for the plaintiff to remain in Mumbai beyond 10 April 2015. The plaintiff does not allege that there was any such specific approval. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Second, the plaintiff alleges that he understood the third defendant’s offer to meet the plaintiff in Mumbai on 24 April 2015 as an instruction that the plaintiff should remain in Mumbai until 24 April 2015.

</div>
</div> That is disingenuous and a pure contrivance. The third defendant’s offer to the plaintiff to meet him in Mumbai was purely an indulgence to the plaintiff. It came only after the plaintiff had refused to obey the third defendant’s instruction to meet in Singapore and as an effort to accommodate the plaintiff’s personal circumstances with his parents’ illness. The plaintiff had no basis to read the third defendant’s offer as an instruction to remain in Mumbai after 10 April 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Finally, the plaintiff alleges that the LCA Group told him, in response to his query, that he did not require approval to postpone the date of his return from Mumbai to Hong Kong from 10 April 2015 to 29 April 2015.

</div>
</div> His case is that this amounts to approval for him to remain in Mumbai after 10 April 2015. This is another disingenuous contrivance. The plaintiff’s query was in substance about the LCA Group’s travel and expenses policy about the cost of postponing his flight. It was not a query about extending his approved absence from his primary place of work. Further, the person who told him that no approval was required for the date change because there was no cost difference was a junior member of the LCA Group’s administrative staff.

At this meeting, the third defendant set out the three conditions for the plaintiff’s continued employment. First, Singapore was now to be the plaintiff’s primary place of work, with his scope of work focusing on operations and portfolio management. Second, the plaintiff had to accept that he was entitled only to 2.5% of the carry on Fund II. Finally, the plaintiff had to agree to draw a line under the past and to perform his contractual obligations going forward in a cooperative and responsive manner.

Clause 5.5 does not stipulate any specific form for the written notice of deficiency which it obliges the LCA Group to provide to the plaintiff. The contractual intent of cl 5.5 is to afford a measure of employment fairness to the plaintiff. It ensures that the plaintiff has a chance to redeem himself before the LCA Group can take the final and irreversible step of terminating the employer/employee relationship. It further ensure that that termination will not come as a surprise to the plaintiff. Thus, the LCA Group must not only give the plaintiff notice that he is at risk of termination but must also tell him what deficiency has caused that risk to arise and allow him an appropriate amount of time to correct the deficiency. The contractual intent in requiring the notice of deficiency to be in writing is to enhance the protection which cl 5.5 affords to the plaintiff by minimising the scope for miscommunication or misunderstanding the contents of the notice and by alleviating problems of proving that notice was or was not given. The contractual intent of cl 5.5 is served so long as the LCA Group gives the plaintiff notice in writing of the deficiencies in his performance and allows him an opportunity to correct those deficiencies. So long as the plaintiff understands the significance of the notice and the seriousness of the consequence that may ensue if he does not take advantage of the opportunity afforded to him to correct his deficiencies, the precise form of the notice is irrelevant to the contractual intent of cl 5.5.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The LCA Group gave the plaintiff many such notices and opportunities.

</div> I give no weight to his opinion. Whether or not a particular written communication which the LCA Group issued to the plaintiff is a notice of deficiency within the meaning of cl 5.5 is a question of law. It is an issue for the court to decide. It cannot be the subject of evidence, particularly from a witness of fact such as the fourth defendant. Furthermore, the June 2014 Contract is expressly governed by Singapore law. The issue cannot therefore even be the subject of expert evidence. The fourth defendant’s opinion on the issue, coming from a witness of fact and moreover on a matter of Singapore law, is quite irrelevant to my determination of the proper construction of cl 5.5 and its application to the LCA Group’s communications with the plaintiff.

The provisions in cl 9 relating to denunciation do not oblige the plaintiff to denounce cl 9. They merely provide that if it chooses to do so, it must do so in writing and, on the plaintiff’s case, on 29 June 2015. Even if the plaintiff is correct that the 16 July 2015 email is not a valid denunciation within the meaning of cl 9, that invalidity is its only consequence. The failed attempt to denounce cl 9 on 16 July 2015 does not put the LCA Group in breach of contract or even in anticipatory breach of contract. The effect of the invalid denunciation is that cl 9 simply continues to bind the parties in accordance with its terms. The plaintiff continued to be entitled to receive the monthly indemnity from the LCA Group. But the express condition precedent to be fulfilled month by month to receive the monthly indemnity continued to bind the plaintiff. That condition precedent was never fulfilled during the six month non-compete period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 The plaintiff’s claim for the monthly indemnity fails. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Claim 6: stigma loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 The plaintiff’s sixth claim is that the LCA Group terminated his employment contract in breach of contract and in breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the contract, thereby attaching a stigma to him in the employment market by reason of which he has to date been unable to find any employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 I assume, without deciding, that there is an implied term of mutual trust and confidence in every employment contract governed by Singapore law (<span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San Lawrence Bernard v Robinson &amp; Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 357 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span>”) at [24]). I also assume, without deciding, that the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA</span> [1988] AC 20 (“<span class="font-italic">Malik</span>”), approved <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> in <span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span>, represents the law in Singapore. I also assume in the plaintiff’s favour, contrary to my finding, that the LCA Group terminated the plaintiff’s employment in breach of contract and, more specifically, in breach of this implied term.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 Even with the benefit of all these assumptions, this claim is misconceived. As the LCA Group points out, if all that an employer does is to terminate an employee’s employment in breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, “the only damages recoverable by the employee will be damages for premature termination losses flowing from the employer’s failure to give proper notice or pay salary in lieu of notice” (<span class="font-italic">Wee Kim San</span> at [34] and [36]). There is in this situation no scope for the employee to recover “stigma loss”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 The plaintiff’s case is simply that the LCA Group committed a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence when it terminated his employment on 29 June 2015. The plaintiff does not allege that the LCA Group breached the implied term in any other way. Thus, for example, it is not the plaintiff’s case that the LCA Group engaged in corrupt business practices which caused a stigma to attach to its employees, as in <span class="font-italic">Malik</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 Therefore, even if the LCA Group had terminated the plaintiff’s employment in breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, there would be no scope for the plaintiff to recover any damages under the rule in<span class="font-italic"> Malik</span>. The result is <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, given that I have found that the LCA Group committed <span class="font-italic">no</span> breach of contract whatsoever in terminating the plaintiff’s employment. It was the plaintiff who breached the contract by his sustained and wilful insubordination and misconduct from February 2015 to June 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 The claim for stigma loss is dismissed. There is no breach of the implied term to sustain such a claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 That suffices to dispose of the entirety of the plaintiff’s six claims against the defendants. I now turn to consider the LCA Group’s counterclaim against the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The LCA Group’s counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 The plaintiff does not seriously dispute the facts underlying the LCA Group’s counterclaim.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 I deal with the plaintiff’s alleged obligation of confidence in equity before considering his alleged contractual obligation of confidentiality.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Obligation of confidence in equity</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 In considering the law on the obligation of confidence in equity, it is useful to keep separate three conceptually distinct questions: (a) the circumstances which give rise to the obligation of confidence; (b) the conduct which amounts to a breach of the obligation of confidence; and (c) the nature and the extent of the remedy to be granted for the breach. A subsidiary issue on each of these three questions is the allocation of the burden of proving the factual predicates relevant to each question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The three questions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 On the first of the three questions, two Court of Appeal decisions in 2020 have established that a person (X) will owe an obligation of confidence in equity to another person (Y) in relation to certain information if and only if two factual predicates are proven:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The information has the necessary quality of confidence about it (<span class="font-italic">LVM</span> at [15(a)] and [16]; <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [20], [43] and [61]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Y imparted the information to X in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence binding upon X’s conscience in equity (<span class="font-italic">LVM</span> at [15(b)] and [17]; <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [20(b)], [43] and [61]). This predicate will be satisfied even if Y did not, on the facts, voluntarily and consciously make the information known to X (in the ordinary sense of the word “impart”) so long as X first accessed or acquired the information from Y by surreptitious means, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> without Y’s knowledge or without Y’s consent (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [61]; <span class="font-italic">Vestwin Trading Pte Ltd v Obegi Melissa </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 573 at [45]–[50]; appeal allowed on other grounds in <span class="font-italic">Obegi Melissa v Vestwin Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 540).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 On the second question, it is obviously a breach of the obligation of confidence for X to misuse the information to Y’s detriment (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [50]). But it is equally a breach of the obligation: (a) for X to create a real and sensible possibility that he will misuse the information (<span class="font-italic">LVM</span> at [15(c)] and [20]–[21]); and (b) for X improperly to threaten the confidentiality of the information (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [51] and [54]). Thus, X can breach the obligation even if his conduct causes no harm or damage (in the ordinary sense of the word “detriment”) to Y (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [50]–[51]). In particular, X’s conduct in surreptitiously accessing or acquiring Y’s confidential information without Y’s knowledge or Y’s consent can both give rise to an obligation of confidence and also amount to a breach of the obligation of confidence (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 On the third question, because the obligation arises in equity, only equitable remedies are available as relief. And the available remedies being equitable, they are granted only in the discretion of the court, not as of right (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [67]). The available remedies include a final injunction. The injunction can be granted in prohibitory form, either to bring an end once and for all to an ongoing breach of the obligation or <span class="font-italic">quia timet</span> to prevent a future breach of the obligation. The injunction can also be granted in mandatory form, to require X to deliver up or to permanently erase the information in order to eliminate any possibility of X misusing the information or to eliminate any improper threat to its confidentiality (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [68]). The available remedies include the court’s power to grant damages in lieu of an injunction under paragraph 14 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), read with s 18(2) of that Act (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [77]). Finally, the available remedies include the court’s power to order an account of profits and to award equitable compensation (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The burden of proof</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 One each of these three questions, the burden of proof is allocated as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 Y bears the legal burden of proof on both of the factual predicates necessary to establish that X owes Y an obligation of confidence (<span class="font-italic">LVM </span>at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 There is a division of opinion as to who bears the burden of proof on the issue of breach. The Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">LVM</span> proceeded on the basis that the burden rests on Y to prove the breach (<span class="font-italic">LVM</span> at [23]). However, a differently constituted coram of the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> that the burden rests on X to establish that his conduct has left his conscience unaffected (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [61]). Allocating the burden of disproving the breach to X in this way, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, vindicates the full extent of Y’s interest in the information which equity protects: (a) the interest in preventing X from making a wrongful gain or profit from Y’s confidential information (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [50]); and (b) Y’s interest in avoiding the threat of X inflicting a wrongful loss on Y by creating an improper threat to the confidentiality of Y’s information (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [53]–[55] and [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 One way of reconciling the division of opinion in <span class="font-italic">LVM</span> and <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> is by noting that in <span class="font-italic">LVM</span>, X was a law firm and first acquired the confidential information in the course of representing Y’s <span class="font-italic">opponent</span> in litigation <span class="font-italic">against</span> Y. Y therefore knew full well that X was acquiring the information when X first acquired it. And Y’s consent to that acquisition was irrelevant because Y had no contractual or other nexus to X. In <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, on the other hand, X first acquired the confidential information surreptitiously, without Y’s knowledge and without Y’s consent. And X did so in a situation where X was an employee of Y, thereby establishing the necessary nexus between them to make both Y’s knowledge and Y’s consent relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 On the issue of remedies, there is no division of opinion: the legal burden of proof in relation to the factual predicates relevant to persuading the court to exercise its discretion to grant one of the remedies available rests on Y (<span class="font-italic">LVM</span> at [23]. This includes satisfying the court as to the appropriate nature and extent of the remedy. That does not, however, preclude the evidential burden of proof shifting to X on any particular aspect of Y’s case (<span class="font-italic">LVM</span> at [24]; <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law applied to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The plaintiff owed an obligation of confidence to the LCA Group</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 The plaintiff owes an obligation of confidence in equity to the LCA Group because both factual predicates necessary for the obligation to arise are satisfied. On the first (see [246(a)] above), he concedes that the emails include at least some information which has the necessary quality of confidence about it.

</div> On the second (see [246(b)] above), he does not argue that the LCA Group sent the emails to him in circumstances which did not import an obligation of confidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 As a result, the plaintiff came under an obligation of confidence to the LCA Group from the date on which he received each email. The obligation of confidence did not arise on the date on which he forwarded that email to his Hotmail account. This is so even though the plaintiff’s conduct in forwarding each email was surreptitious conduct, undertaken without the LCA Group’s knowledge or consent. That type of surreptitious conduct is capable, in itself, of satisfying the second factual predicate for an obligation of confidence to arise (see [246(b)] above). But the critical point in this case is that the plaintiff had, at the time he forwarded these emails, already acquired these emails with the LCA Group’s knowledge and consent. That occurred when the LCA Group sent each of the emails to the plaintiff’s LVMH account, with the plaintiff as an addressee, as a cc party or as a bcc party. This is not a case where, for example, the plaintiff gained unauthorised access to <span class="font-italic">another</span> employee’s emails and forwarded them to his personal Hotmail account. Therefore, it is not the plaintiff’s surreptitious conduct in forwarding these emails to his Hotmail account between March and June 2015 which gave rise to his obligation of confidence. The obligation arose and bound him from the time he first acquired the emails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The plaintiff breached his obligation of confidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 The burden of proving a breach of the obligation of confidence rests on the LCA Group. This is because the plaintiff first acquired the emails with the LCA Group’s knowledge and consent. This case is in that sense more akin to <span class="font-italic">LVM</span> rather than to <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>. There is therefore no burden on the plaintiff to disprove breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 The plaintiff breached his obligation of confidence to the LCA Group.

The plaintiff’s conduct is the virtual world’s equivalent of taking physical documents which the LCA Group had given to the plaintiff for the purposes of his employment, duplicating the documents, leaving the originals in the office and taking the copies home. The effect of the plaintiff’s conduct was twofold: (a) he deprived the LCA Group of the exclusive power in a practical sense to control access to and prevent disclosure of the information contained in the emails; and (b) he acquired for himself an unrestricted power in a practical sense to have access to the information contained in the emails and to disclose it for his own purposes. His conduct was a direct infringement of the LCA Group’s wrongful loss interest identified in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> (at [53]–[55]). That interest is engaged even outside the paradigm situations of unauthorised use or disclosure of the information (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The plaintiff’s grounds for denying the breach</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 The plaintiff denies that he breached his obligation of confidence on two grounds.

</div> an allegation that the LCA Group’s information technology staff had approved this practice on previous occasions. That may well be true. But the evidence before me suggests that the LCA Group condoned this practice only for work-related purposes. The plaintiff had no work-related purpose for forwarding these emails to his Hotmail account. This alleged common practice, even if established, would not negate his breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 Second, the plaintiff submits that it is not a breach of an obligation of confidence for X to copy and disclose confidential information to X’s solicitors and to the court in order to establish or protect his legal rights in litigation against Y or to defend himself in litigation by Y. For this proposition, the plaintiff relies on <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee v Citra Group Pte Ltd </span>[2015] SGHC 30 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee</span>”) at [228]–[229].

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  PRCS at para 187.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 In <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee</span>, Tan Siong Thye J held (at [228]) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">228 I find that while the information and documents are confidential, there was no breach of confidence by the plaintiff. The duty to maintain confidentiality is not an unqualified one and the scope of confidence is not so wide such that the confidential information cannot be used for the purposes of establishing one’s claim. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">229 Balancing the rights of the plaintiff and [the defendants] I find that the balance lies with the plaintiff. Disclosing the confidential information for the purposes of legal proceedings is necessary for the plaintiff to have access to justice and establish his legal rights. They were disclosed in the interests of justice and to enable the truth to be elucidated, facilitating the litigation process. Therefore, there was no breach of confidentiality by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 The plaintiff’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee</span> is misplaced for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 First, <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee</span> was decided five years before the decisions in <span class="font-italic">LVM</span> and in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>. <span class="font-italic">LVM</span> and <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> are both Court of Appeal decisions and are therefore, of course, binding on me. Both of those decisions now recognise that the full extent of Y’s legitimate interest in confidential information goes beyond simply preventing detriment in the sense of misuse or disclosure and extends to eliminating a real and sensible possibility that the information will be misused and eliminating an improper threat to the confidentiality of the information (see [247] above). Conduct by X which infringes upon Y’s legitimate interest amounts to a breach of confidence, whether or not it is undertaken in the context of litigation against Y. The plaintiff’s conduct infringed both interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 Second, the proposition from <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee</span> on which the plaintiff relies (see [260] above) is against the weight of authority. There is English authority that it is a breach of confidence for an employee to forward emails containing information confidential to his employer to his personal email account in order to deploy that information in litigation by or against an employer. As the English authorities recognise, the proper course for an employee in that position is not to breach his obligation of confidence but to honour the obligation and to use the proper procedural machinery to compel disclosure of the confidential material from the employer, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> by seeking pre-action or in-action discovery or by administering interrogatories (Toulson &amp; Phipps on Confidentiality 4th Ed. (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2020) at [13-012]; <span class="font-italic">Brandeaux Advisers (UK) Limited v Chadwick</span> [2010] EWHC 3241 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Tokio Marine Kiln Insurance Services Ltd v Yang</span> [2013] EWHC 1948 at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Farnan v Sunderland Association Football Club Ltd</span> [2015] EWHC 3759 at [77]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 The tenor of the English authority must be correct as a matter of principle. If the law were otherwise, it would amount to granting a licence to every disgruntled employee contemplating a claim against his employer or fearing a claim by his employer to duplicate and appropriate reams of confidential information of potential relevance to the claim. That would not only be employment law anarchy, it would also eviscerate the additional legitimate interest which the employer has in its confidential information which <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> has now explicitly recognised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 I therefore do not accept that copying and disclosing the emails to the plaintiff’s solicitors or to the court for the purposes of establishing or protecting his legal rights as against the LCA Group in any way negates the plaintiff’s breach of his duty of obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 I also do not accept that assessing whether a breach of confidence has taken place is a discretionary balancing exercise (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> <span class="font-italic">Leong Hin Chuee</span> at [229]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Remedy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 I now turn to the question of remedy. Despite my finding that the plaintiff owed an obligation of confidence to the LCA Group and breached it, I decline to exercise my discretion in favour of granting the LCA Group any of the equitable remedies it seeks. I arrive at that conclusion for four reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 First, the LCA Group adduced no evidence: (a) that the plaintiff had any purpose in forwarding the emails to himself other than disclosing them to his lawyers; (b) that the plaintiff made any use of the emails other than disclosing them to his lawyers and the court; (c) that the plaintiff is likely to misuse or disclose the emails in the future; (d) that the plaintiff made or is likely to make any electronic or physical copies of the emails; (e) that the plaintiff’s breach has caused the LCA Group any loss or damage (despite a bare plea to that effect); or (f) that the plaintiff’s breach yielded him any profits or other gains. I therefore accept the plaintiff’s evidence: (a) that the only purpose for which he forwarded these emails to his Hotmail account was to disclose them to his lawyers in order to seek legal advice; and (b) that the only use he has made of the emails was to disclose them to his lawyers for the purpose of seeking legal advice and to the court for the purpose of this litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 Second, the LCA Group does not suggest that it would not have disclosed the emails itself in discovery in this action in any event, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> even if the plaintiff had not forwarded them to his Hotmail account. And the LCA Group has indeed disclosed the emails in this action, albeit subject to redaction. Therefore, the plaintiff’s lawyers and the court would have come to know the contents of the emails with or without the plaintiff’s breach of confidence. The plaintiff’s conduct merely accelerated the disclosure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">271 Third, the emails and the information contained in them and in their attachments are now at least seven years old. The LCA Group does not suggest that their contents are so confidential that they are worthy of protection by a <span class="font-italic">quia timet</span> or mandatory injunction to this day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 Fourth, insofar as it is considered desirable or necessary for the court to mark its disapproval of the plaintiff’s breach, I point out that the primary purpose of a remedy, even in equity, is to protect or compensate the party who has been wronged and not to mark disapproval or to punish the wrongdoer. In any event, my finding of breach has exposed the plaintiff to a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> liability for costs. So in that sense, the LCA Group will <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> be compensated for the only actual loss which the plaintiff’s breach of confidence has caused it: the costs of this counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 I therefore do not accept that the grant of any of the remedies which the LCA Group claims for the plaintiff’s breach of confidence is warranted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Contractual obligation of confidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 As for the contractual obligation of confidence, the plaintiff admits that he owed that obligation to the LCA Group in respect of the emails under the express and implied terms of his employment contract.

</div> His grounds for denying breach are the same two grounds I have analysed and rejected at [258]–[266] above. I reject them again in the context of his contractual obligation of confidence for the same reasons. In any event, liability for a breach of contract is strict. It therefore matters not why the plaintiff breached his contractual obligations, even if it was for the purest of motives. The plaintiff does not suggest that either of his two grounds affords any contractual defence, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> by becoming incorporated as a terms of his employment contract or by giving rise to an estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 The plaintiff is therefore <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> liable to the LCA Group for breaching his contractual obligation of confidence. As a remedy for this breach, however, I decline to award the LCA Group any form of permanent injunction or substantive damages. That is for the same reasons set out above at [268]–[273]. Quite simply, the LCA Group has failed to show that it has suffered any loss or damage or will suffer any loss or damage by the plaintiff’s breach of contract. But that does not suffice to negate the LCA Group’s right to recover damages from him. Simply by virtue of his breach of contract, the plaintiff’s employer at the time of the breach is entitled to an award of nominal damages against the plaintiff. I assess those nominal damages at $1,000. The plaintiff’s employer between March and June 2015 was the second defendant under the June 2014 Contract. The plaintiff will therefore have to pay $1,000 as nominal damages to the second defendant for breach of his employment contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 The plaintiff mounted an elaborate, contrived and exaggerated claim in every respect. It has failed in every respect. He showed himself to be an employee with a vastly inflated sense of his own skills and worth. He showed himself to be a litigant and a witness with only a loose relationship with the truth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 For all of the foregoing reasons, I dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ claims. I also allow the second defendant’s counterclaim. I therefore enter judgment against the plaintiff in favour of the second defendant on the counterclaim for $1,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 The only remaining matter to deal with are the costs of the claim and the counterclaim. I now invite the parties to ascertain the other party’s position on costs and to reach agreement on costs as far as possible. To the extent that no agreement can be reached, the parties are to file and serve, within three weeks of the date on which this judgment is handed down, written submissions on costs not exceeding 7,500 words (excluding title page and footnotes).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 Each party’s written submissions should address: (a) who should pay and who should receive the costs of the claim and the counterclaim, or any part thereof; (b) whether those costs should be awarded on the standard basis or the indemnity basis; (c) whether those costs should be taxed or fixed; and (d) in the latter event, the quantum of those costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 Further, each party is to justify its submissions on the quantum of costs by reference to: (a) the costs schedules which have been filed, including the costs schedule filed by that party itself; (b) the applicable costs guidelines in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions entitled “Guidelines for Party-and-Party Costs Awards in the Supreme Court of Singapore”; (c) any formal offers to settle or offers of compromise without prejudice save as to costs which have been made and which carry costs consequences; and (d) any taxation precedents which may be comparable and relevant. The written submissions should also address any interlocutory matters for which costs were not fixed but were ordered instead to be in the cause, to be reserved or to be a particular party’s costs in any event.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Roderick Martin SC, Rajaram Ramiah, Senthi, Dayalan, Nandhu, Gideon Yap, Eugene Tan (RHTLaw Asia LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Chee Meng SC, Jenny Tsin, Alma Yong, Chang Qi-Yang, Koh Jiawen, Ephraim Tan (Wong Partnership LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
