For present purposes, it suffices to note the following. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The respondent was employed by Chye Joo Marine Pte Ltd since 6 May 2013 to perform grit blasting and painting works at a shipyard (“the Shipyard”). In this connection, he operated forklifts and supervised the work of other workers.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 26 May 2019, six employees – including the respondent, Shanmugam and the deceased – were assigned to work at the Shipyard. The team began spray painting a vessel at about 9.00am. At about 3.00pm, the respondent sought permission from one Velu Prakashraj (“Velu”), employee of Asia-Pacific Shipyard Pte Ltd (the operator of the Shipyard) (“APS”) to use a forklift (which was distinct from the K Forklift) (“the M Forklift”). Velu allowed the respondent to use the M Forklift as he knew the respondent was a certified forklift operator but cautioned the respondent that the brakes of the M Forklift were not effective. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Separately, at about 5.00pm, the respondent wanted to seek permission to use the K Forklift (which similarly had faulty brakes). However, as none of the APS employees were present at the Shipyard and the respondent knew that he could start the engine to the K Forklift without an ignition key, he used his locker key to ignite and operate the K Forklift. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The respondent and Shanmugam subsequently used the K Forklift to transfer spray painting equipment. Sometime after 5.40pm, Shanmugam attempted to transport a blasting pot using the K Forklift. In his attempt to elevate the height of the forks of the K Forklift to lift the blasting pot, Shanmugam erroneously stepped on the accelerator of the K Forklift (while the K Forklift was in forward, rather than neutral gear). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 This caused the K Forklift to crash through the guardrail along the edge of a slipway and fall onto the slipway, resulting in minor injuries to one Subramaniam and the death of a co-worker. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Investigations subsequently revealed that (a) Shanmugam was not certified, trained and competent to operate a forklift; (b) the respondent had allowed Shanmugam to operate forklifts on multiple occasions knowing that Shanmugam lacked the qualifications to do so; and (c) the respondent knew that the brakes of the K Forklift were faulty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The DJ considered that the two-stage sentencing framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Mao Xuezhong v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2020] 5 SLR 580 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mao</span>”) pertaining to offences under s 15(3A) of the WSHA (involving negligent acts) could be modified to deal with wilful or reckless acts under s 15(3) of the WSHA and that the factors relevant to harm and culpability set out at [64(a)] of <span class="font-italic">Mao</span> were equally relevant to cases involving s 15(3) of the WSHA.

</div> In particular, she found that the respondent was less culpable than Shanmugam given that (a) Shanmugam had committed an additional unsafe and reckless act, namely in operating the K Forklift in a manner which resulted in the fatal accident; (b) the respondent’s reckless act of permitting Shanmugam to operate the forklift was distinct from the accident caused by Shanmugam; (c) the accident arose because Shanmugam mistakenly stepped on the acceleration pedal (which had nothing to do with the faulty brakes and which could have still occurred if a trained individual operated the K Forklift); (d) the respondent did not instruct Shanmugam to operate the K Forklift in a reckless manner or deviate from the usual safety procedure; and (e) it was too onerous to expect the respondent to have refused to comply with instructions to perform the works using forklifts with faulty brakes.

In so far as the respondent’s act of permitting Shanmugam to operate the forklift cannot be artificially divorced from Shanmugam’s subsequent mishandling of the forklift, the DJ accorded too much weight to the fact that the respondent was not the proximate cause of the incident.

I note that this accords with the High Court’s provisional view in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Manta Equipment (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2022] SGHC 157 (“<span class="font-italic">Manta</span>”) that the two-stage sentencing approach set out in <span class="font-italic">Manta</span> (which is consistent with the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Mao</span>) “should in principle apply to <span class="font-italic">all</span> Part 4 offences punishable under s 50 of the [WSHA]” (at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As parties have not made submissions on the propriety of the appellant’s proposed sentencing ranges for the various sectors in the sentencing matrix governing offences under s 15(3) of the WSHA (which the DJ relied on), I make no finding on this. It suffices to note that Shanmugam’s sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment is not the subject of the present appeal and the key question for present purposes is whether the DJ correctly assessed the culpability of the respondent and particularly vis-à-vis Shanmugam’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Before leaving the issue of the appellant’s proposed sentencing matrix for offences under s 15(3) of the WSHA, I make one observation. I caution against any notion that “the sentence ranges for high level of culpability should generally be reserved for wilful acts”.

</div> Wilfulness and recklessness are dichotomous legal concepts but no bright line distinction can be drawn between the two <span class="font-italic">mentes reae</span> in assessing the culpability of an offender <span class="font-italic">at the sentencing stage</span>. Each case turns on its own facts (see also <span class="font-italic">Jali bin Mohd Yunos v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 4 SLR 1059 at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Set against this backdrop, I find that the DJ erred in assessing the respondent’s culpability to be lower than Shanmugam’s. Though Shanmugam was the individual who negligently stepped on the accelerator of the K Forklift, this cannot be neatly divorced from the fact that the respondent – as Shanmugam’s supervisor – allowed Shanmugam to operate the K Forklift knowing that the latter was not trained or competent to operate the forklift and that the forklift had faulty brakes. To draw a water-tight distinction between the respondent permitting Shanmugam to use the forklift and Shanmugam’s subsequent act (in the manner that the DJ had done) accords insufficient weight to first, the working relationship between the respondent and Shanmugam and second, the fact that it is reasonably foreseeable that an untrained and uncertified operator may make mistakes and cause accidents while operating a forklift.

</div> In the former regard, it is undisputed that Shanmugam worked under the supervision of the respondent. In this connection, the DJ implicitly recognised the influence that the respondent had over Shanmugam’s reckless act; she observed that Shanmugam “was authorised and instructed by [the respondent]” and did not operate the K Forklift “on a frolic of his own”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The DJ’s assessment of the acts of the respondent and Shanmugam also unjustifiably attenuates a supervisor’s culpability for facilitating a supervisee’s reckless act. It is pertinent to note that (a) the legislative intent of the WSHA was to improve workplace safety by effecting a cultural change for employers and other stakeholders to take proactive measures to prevent accidents; and (b) the scope of liability under s 15(3) of the WSHA was intended to be a broad one, imposing a duty on multiple persons at work to ensure the safety or health of themselves and others (<span class="font-italic">Mao</span> at [40] and [47]). Thus, during the Second Reading of the Workplace Safety and Health Bill (Bill No 36/2005) – through which Parliament promulgated s 15(3) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (“WSHA 2006”) (which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> to s 15(3) of the WSHA) – then Minister for Manpower, Dr Ng Eng Hen observed that under the liability regime introduced by the WSHA 2006, “responsibility for the safety and health of others will lie not only with employers, but also with employees, whether they be supervisors or rank-and-file workers” (<span class="font-italic">Nurun </span>at [57]). I find that the DJ’s evaluation of the relative culpabilities of the respondent and Shanmugam cuts against the public interest in ensuring that persons who hold positions of authority under the WSHA (and who, for this reason, are likely to have greater influence over workplace practices) act in a manner that respects the safety of their supervisees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 For the avoidance of doubt, my holding in this regard should not be (mis)construed as a pronouncement that supervisors will invariably be equally or more culpable than supervisees where the latter acts in a reckless manner. Again, each case turns on its own facts. In the present case, the constellation of factors, including the working relationship between the respondent and Shanmugam and the fact that the respondent permitted Shanmugam to operate a faulty forklift on multiple occasions knowing that Shanmugam lacked the training to do so, militates in favour of a finding that the respondent’s culpability was, minimally, on par with Shanmugam’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Next, I also find that the DJ placed undue weight on the fact that the faulty brakes did not materially contribute to the accident.

</div> That said, even if the proximate cause of the accident was Shanmugam mistakenly stepping on the accelerator, one must be alive to the reality that the risk of an untrained individual erroneously operating a forklift with malfunctioning brakes is significantly higher than the commensurate risk of this individual operating a functioning forklift. Whilst the respondent’s counsel submits that the issue of the faulty brakes is relevant only to an assessment of potential harm and which the DJ had already pegged as high,

</div>
</div> I find to the contrary. That the respondent knew that the forklift had malfunctioning brakes and still permitted Shanmugam, an untrained individual, to operate it, heightens his culpability as a supervisor. This is inasmuch as culpability includes a consideration of the nature of the unsafe act (<span class="font-italic">Mao </span>at [64(a)(ii)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Finally, in my view, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Chong </span>is of limited assistance to the respondent. First, <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Chong</span> is not a decision involving workplace safety. Rather, Chong and Nazhan, who had sanctioned the continuance of ragging through their inaction (in contradistinction to Fatwa and Farid who actively encouraged ragging and made sure that the servicemen of Tuas View Fire Station submerged the victim in the pump well), were convicted of offences under s 338(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The legislative intent animating the WSHA, in particular to ensure that all stakeholders would be held responsible for workplace safety (<span class="font-italic">Nurun</span> at [57]), is a consideration that was not germane on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Kenneth Chong</span>. Second, while Chong, Nazhan and the respondent were each one step removed from the act(s) that eventually resulted in the death of the victims, the respondent, unlike Chong and Nazhan, had directly contributed to the initial unsafe state of affairs by permitting Shanmugam to operate the K Forklift. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For completeness, I briefly deal with <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wong Kiew Hai and others</span> (DSC 900150/2018 &amp; Ors) (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Kiew Hai</span>”), a decision which was accompanied by the District Judge’s brief oral remarks. Before me, the respondent’s counsel submitted that the fact that the natural persons subject of<span class="font-italic"> Wong Kiew Hai</span>, namely Wong and Yee, received sentences of eight and ten months’ imprisonment respectively even though they committed reckless acts under s 15(3) of the WSHA which contributed to the death of one worker and injuries to ten others suggested that the respondent’s sentence of seven months’ imprisonment was fair and just. I am unable to accept this submission. It must be remembered that the District Judge had reduced Wong and Yee’s respective sentences by three months to account for the fact that a more culpable co-accused person, one Robert Tjandra, had earlier been sentenced to approximately 12 months’ imprisonment on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Nurun</span> (which was subsequently disapproved by <span class="font-italic">Mao</span>).
