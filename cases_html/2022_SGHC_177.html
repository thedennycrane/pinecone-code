</div> The complaints by the police posted on its Facebook page (which I understand to refer to the press statement issued by the police on 19 May 2021), have nothing to do with the contents of the subject statement; the police’s press statement concerns the allegation that four police officers crowded around the elderly lady and told her off for not wearing a face mask. This is true based on the video evidence: there were four police officers around her, and a police officer did speak loudly to the elderly lady and took issue with her not wearing a mask. This is further supported by evidence obtained by Ms Pak from the elderly lady. In contrast, the police failed to provide video evidence which is in their possession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Third, there has also been an abuse of power by the Minister in his directing that TOC post the corrective notice as a new Facebook post, as opposed to a corrective notice atop the offending post.

The appellant’s argument is twofold.

</div> Alternatively, the adverse inference is an evidential principle in the common law available to the court. Thus, the court is able to draw an adverse inference presently. Second, an adverse inference ought to be drawn despite the respondent having adduced additional footage.

This licence was cancelled as of 15 October 2021: Infocomm Media Development Authority, “Cancellation of The Online Citizen Pte Ltd Class Licence”, press release (15 October 2021), <https: 2021="" cancellation-of-the-online-citizen-pte-ltd-class-licence="" media-releases="" media-room="" news-and-events="" www.imda.gov.sg=""> (“15 October 2021 Press Release”). As the TOC website was no longer appropriately licenced, it could no longer use its websites and social media accounts at the time of the hearing, and certainly by the time of this judgment. In fact, it had been suspended from doing so as of 14 September 2021 due to its “fail[ure] to comply with the requirement to make an annual declaration of its funding sources in respect of TOC’s 2020 Undertaking and Statutory Declaration”: 15 October 2021 Press Release.</https:></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Correction Direction issued by the Minister was made under s 11 of the Act, and specified that the correction notice should be posted on TOC’s Facebook page. The present appeal is against the Correction Direction. As the Correction Direction required action with respect to a specific social media site, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, TOC’s Facebook page, if that site is no longer operated or in use, the Correction Direction is not displayed. Since the Correction Direction is not displayed, it cannot be removed, even if the appeal is successful.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Mr Lim Tean, counsel for the appellant, maintained that his client still wishes to pursue the application as a matter of principle. While that is understandable, to my mind, the Court should only make an order under the Act if there is some practical effect. Courts would be slow to grant relief, especially in a public law setting, if the relief sought would be futile, and of no effect:  <span class="font-italic">AG (Pakistan) (R on the application of) </span><span class="font-italic">v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2011] EWCA Civ 998 at [7] to [9]; see also <span class="font-italic">Pannir Selvam a/l</span> <span class="font-italic">Pranthaman v Attorney-General</span> [2022] SGCA 35 at [29], which affirmed the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Pannir Selvam a/l Pranthaman v Attorney-General </span>[2022] 3 SLR 838 at [73] where the relief sought by the applicant was denied on the basis that it would be of “zero or very limited utility, whether to the Applicant or the criminal Bar as a whole”. This is all the more so when the issues are factual and would not have a wider import.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Here, any vindication of TOC’s position would not lead to any practical consequence. It cannot operate its websites or social media accounts. The Correction Direction does not appear anywhere, so there is nothing to complain of. While it is true that the fact that the Correction Direction was issued would always remain, I could not see that that fact would engage any substantive interest of TOC. No harm or injury arose from the issuing of the Correction Direction alone. Though this is not a public or administrative law case, I am of the view that the same approach should apply: the underlying basis is simply that the Court should not be asked for orders that are ultimately futile or moot. A similar approach was taken in <span class="font-italic">Heng</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings SEA (Pte) Ltd v Tomongo Shipping Co Ltd</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 669 (“<span class="font-italic">Heng Holdings </span><span class="font-italic">(SEA)</span>”), where the Court refused to deal with the appellant’s contention therein that an injunction should not have been granted or ought to have been discharged or set aside earlier. This was as the injunction had been discharged and parties had entered final judgment by consent with regard to the claim giving rise to the injunction by the time of the hearing: <span class="font-italic">Heng Holdings (SEA)</span> at [29]. Pertinently, as part of the final judgment (which was granted by consent), no injunction was sought as such relief was no longer necessary: <span class="font-italic">Heng Holdings (SEA)</span> at [29]. Any pronouncement or order granted on this front would thus have been academic. The appeal should be dismissed on this ground alone. Nonetheless, I turn to consider the other grounds for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The intended meaning of the subject statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Correction Direction issued specifies that the subject statement, which is false, had been communicated.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 An objective approach is taken here as well: <span class="font-italic">TOC (CA)</span> at [136].   Furthermore, for present purposes, what is important is that the subject statement need not be expressly stated as such in the subject material, but only that it could be construed or interpreted as such. The guidance from the Court of Appeal is that the material should be interpreted objectively in its context, regardless of the subjective intention of the statement maker: <span class="font-italic">TOC (CA)</span> at [156]. At the nub of the exercise is whether there would be “an appreciable segment or a particular class of the potential readership … who would construe [the subject material] as making or containing the subject statement, or regard the subject statement as a reasonable interpretation of the subject material”: <span class="font-italic">TOC (CA) </span>at [156].  This is done as a matter of impression: <span class="font-italic">TOC (CA)</span> at [157]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The subject material refers to the material in respect of which the correction direction was issued: <span class="font-italic">TOC (CA)</span> at [109]. Presently, this refers to the Instagram Stories reported in the TOC Posts which included the following captions:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) “Do we really need 4 policemen to cluster an elderly auntie that took off her mask because she was feeling breathless?!?”;  </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) “Poor auntie already put back on her mask but they continued to tell her off to the extent someone had to come and salvage the situation.”;  </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) “Please @singaporepoliceforce there are people not wearing a mask and asking why people no badge, go and spend your time and make yourself more useful!

Thus, there is sufficient basis for the subject statement, which, to recap, states that the police reprimanded and taunted an elderly woman for not wearing a mask: see [24]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the statement is a statement of fact or is a true statement of fact</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The subject statement is one of fact, but is not a true statement.

</div> The appellant points to the text of the Instagram Stories as showing that it indicated an opinion, and this is reinforced in an email sent by the original poster to the TOC as exhibited in the appellant’s affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The contention is without basis. The Instagram Stories are clear in stating a fact: it refers to actions and remarks made by the police officers that were observed by the original poster. While the Instagram Stories also contain a subjective assessment or evaluation of what was perceived, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the original poster’s opinion on the propriety of the actions of the police officers, the parts that were complained about by the Minister were the characterisation of things occurring or said.

</div> As noted by the respondent, the appellant’s arguments are essentially an invocation of a defence of honest or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reporting. That is not however catered for under the Act. There is no carve out for any repetition of a statement by a media outlet, or any third party. Additionally, that TOC had only reported on the posts does not detract from the subject statement falling within the definition of a statement of fact as per s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act. Plainly, the representations of facts emanating from the subject statement remain unaffected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is also irrelevant that TOC edited its report to take in the response of the police on 19 May 2021. The Correction Direction was directed at the posts of the TOC as they were on 18 May 2021 and in any event, the amendments did not alter the nature of the subject statement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the subject statement is true </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The bulk of the arguments put forward by the appellant is directed to maintaining that the subject statement is true. The appellant relies on the fact that the police did not dispute that there were four police officers at the scene, and that one of the police officers was speaking loudly at the elderly lady, taking issue with her not wearing a mask. This is said to be supported by the elderly lady’s recounting of events to Ms Pak. The appellant also takes issue with the police not releasing the video footage, and instead relying on a statement of just one of the four officers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 To reiterate, the subject statement reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Police reprimanded and taunted the elderly woman, shown in the Instagram story by Instagram user [the original poster] on 18 May 2021, for not wearing a mask.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 What needs to be shown is that the police officers did in fact reprimand and taunt the elderly woman because she was not wearing a mask. The burden lay on the appellant to show this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether the police officers were reprimanding and taunting the elderly lady</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I am satisfied that it is not true that the officers were reprimanding and taunting the elderly lady. In determining this, I had to consider issues of evidence, and the initial absence of certain video footage. On review of the evidence (including the additional footage), there are deficiencies which cannot be resolved in favour of the appellant, who bore the burden.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Video footage </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Initially only the body-worn camera footage from one officer was adduced. Additional footage was subsequently adduced after the Court’s initial remarks.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The respondent argues that the further footage shows that the police did not scold or taunt the elderly lady. I accept from viewing the evidence that there was no taunting or scolding. If anything, what was done was more of inquiry and advice. I note that from the video evidence, what is apparent is that at least two of the officers present were initially under the impression that the lady had lost her way. What was expressed was of concern with the aim of rendering assistance, by getting the elderly lady to put on her mask. The officer mainly dealing with her sat down next to her to talk to her and eventually helped her don on a mask. There is no room on an objective assessment to conclude that the elderly lady was being reprimanded or taunted. There was also no scolding. While the officers were not soothing, or obsequious, or mollifying, it would be a very long stretch to characterise their behaviour as scolding in any way, and certainly not reprimanding or taunting. At the very most, they were perhaps paternalistic or nagging, but there was no element of sharpness, insult, scorn, disrespect, or cruelty, let alone any hint of an intention to anger or cause pain or jeer. There was also no sarcasm present. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In fact, I could not see how the original poster could have in good faith concluded that there was reprimanding or taunting. In addition, I note that one of the officers bought food for the elderly lady, and from the additional videos, that two of the officers interacted with her in a similar manner (as observed at [47]) earlier in the day.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The interview with the elderly lady</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The elderly lady gave an interview to Ms Pak. The appellant adduced this evidence to demonstrate the truth of the subject statement, namely that the elderly lady was indeed taunted, or at least treated badly by the police officers.

</div> This interview was captured on video and transcripts, which included a translation of the Hokkien used in the interview. The appellant had two sets of transcripts: an initial set filed as part of the appeal papers, and a subsequent one provided to the Court subsequently. On the basis that the appellant’s transcript contained inaccuracies, the respondent also adduced its own transcript of the interview. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As it was, the appellant did not in the end take issue with the accuracy of the respondent’s transcripts where it differs from the appellant’s. In the final analysis, I do not find that the transcripts could assist much in the Court’s determination of the material issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The assessment of what transpired is made objectively: <span class="font-italic">TOC (CA) </span>at [159]. How the elderly lady felt she was treated would be of some relevance in the Court’s assessment whether she was taunted or reprimanded. If the intended subject of a remark were to regard what was said as scolding or insult, that should be taken into account. But it would not be determinative. Neither would the speaker’s intentions, thought it may also be somewhat relevant. What matters is the objective assessment by the Court, from the video evidence capturing what transpired, and for the Court to come to a conclusion about what happened. How the actions and statements of the police officers may have been construed by those present, including the elderly lady, who was the one being spoken to, matters much less. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other matters</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the elderly lady suffers from dementia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The respondent further argues that the elderly lady’s response during the interview, taken together with the police report, raise concerns about her mental faculties.

</div> Specifically, the respondent refers to the possibility that the elderly lady may have been suffering from dementia. To this end, the respondent also points to discrepancies in the elderly lady’s answers to Ms Pak in the interview, including the fact that she kept saying that it was about to rain, when it was not, and her denial that the police officers had bought her dinner, though the police officer bought food for her. A police report filed by the elderly lady’s daughter-in-law was also adduced by the respondent: that report stated that the elderly lady had been suffering from dementia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There is insufficient evidence before the Court for me to make any finding on this. The evidence before me is untested, and the elderly lady’s purported condition of dementia is unsupported by any medical report or any other form of corroboration. In the absence of medical evidence, the Court should not make such a finding.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether a presumption could arise under s 116(g) of the EA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The issue arises because the respondent previously had not adduced all the relevant video footage of the incident. Having adduced the additional footage, the respondent argues that the Court need not determine whether any adverse inference may be drawn.

</div> This departure from the norm shows that there was no basis for the corrective notice to appear on top of the posts complained of. There is, however, no merit in this submission. Not only is there no evidence of such a norm, the specific manner in which the present correction notice is to be displayed is not proscribed by the Act.
