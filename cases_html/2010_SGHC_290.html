<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The two applications before me relate to whether
                    the plaintiff’s solicitors, Drew &amp; Napier LLC (“Drew &amp;
                    Napier”) are conflicted from acting for the plaintiff in the present suit
                    on the grounds that they had earlier acted for the defendants in same or related
                    matters and therefore should be restrained from acting as counsel for the
                    plaintiff. For the reasons that follow, I allow the defendants’
                    application to restrain Drew &amp; Napier from doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff Nikolay Vorobiev brought this suit
                    against the defendants John Frederick Peters Lush (“Lush”),
                    Francois Ostinelli (“Ostinelli”) and Alexander Novoselov
                    (“Novoselov”) on the grounds that the defendants made, or
                    conspired to make, fraudulent misrepresentations to him to induce him into
                    entering an agreement for the purchase of 20% of the shares in Stainby Overseas
                    Limited (“Stainby”) (a company incorporated in British Virgin
                    Islands (“BVI”)) which held the shares in Petroval Pte Ltd
                    (“PPL”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff claimed that he and the defendants
                    were directors of PPL. Subsequently, around February 2006, Artem Zakharov
                    (“Zakharov”) contacted the plaintiff who then agreed to buy 20%
                    share in PPL for US$3,810,000. The plaintiff was under the impression that
                    another company Everon held the shares in PPL through Stainby. Pursuant to the
                    agreement, on 8 May 2006, Boyce (a BVI company solely owned by the
                    plaintiff) was issued 20% shareholding in Stainby, and on
                    19 June 2006, Stainby became the sole shareholder of PPL. The three
                    defendants and Zakharov, through their respective nominee companies, also each
                    held 20% shareholdings in Stainby. Around late May or early June 2006, the
                    parties (the plaintiff, the three defendants and Zakharov) agreed that they
                    would each provide loans of US$2,000,000 to Stainby for the purpose of Stainby
                    making a loan of US$10,000,000 to PPL. Following this, around
                    26 June 2006, Stainby and PPL entered into a loan arrangement. Around
                    September 2006, the same parties again agreed they would each provide
                    another loan of US$1,000,000 to Stainby for the purpose of Stainby then making a
                    loan of US$5,000,000 to PPL. Following this, around 27 September 2006,
                    Stainby and PPL entered into another loan arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff further claimed that on
                    7 December 2007, another company Petroval SA (“PSA”)
                    commenced proceedings in BVI against the defendants, their nominee companies,
                    and Boyce, for a declaration that Stainby held the shares in PPL on trust for
                    PSA, and for an account of profits. On 15 February 2008, PSA commenced
                    proceedings in Singapore against the defendants seeking the same reliefs. Around
                    10 September 2009, the parties to the Singapore proceedings
                    settled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The bases of the plaintiff’s claim against
                    the defendants are as follows. Firstly, the plaintiff alleged that the
                    defendants fraudulently misrepresented that they were the ultimate beneficial
                    owners of the shares in PPL or had the authority of the beneficial owners to
                    deal with the PPL shares, when in fact the shares were held by Stainby on trust
                    for PSA (and therefore Stainby did not have the beneficial ownership to PPL).
                    Secondly, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants fraudulently misrepresented
                    that the purchase price paid by him for PPL shares was based on 20% of the price
                    payable by the defendants to Everon for its beneficial shareholding in PPL. The
                    plaintiff alleged that, unknown to him, Everon reduced the purchase price
                    payable to it by the defendants for its beneficial interest in PPL such that the
                    defendants did not have to make any payment to Everon and would only have to
                    declare all of PPL’s monies at that time as dividends to Stainby (and
                    ultimately to Everon). Thirdly, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants
                    fraudulently misrepresented that neither Petroval Bunkering International
                    (“PBI”) nor PPL will have any assets or liabilities at the time he
                    acquires his 20% shareholding in PPL, although in fact PBI had liabilities
                    amounting to US$5,000,000 at the material time. The plaintiff alleged that as a
                    consequence of the defendants’ misrepresentations, he suffered losses
                    amounting to US$3,810,000 for the purchase of the 20% stake in PPL, and
                    US$3,000,000 for the shareholder loans made. In the alternative, the plaintiff
                    alleged that the defendants wrongfully and dishonestly and with the intent to
                    injure him, conspired and agreed together to make the representations to induce
                    him to purchase a stake in Stainby, and to make the loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As the action against the first defendant has
                    currently been stayed, and service on the second and third defendants have been
                    set aside (see below), the defendants have not entered their
                defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Registrar’s Appeal No 154 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 30 September 2009, Lush filed an
                    application to stay the proceedings against him in favour of Switzerland. The
                    stay was granted by assistant registrar Crystal Tan but is now the subject
                    of appeal (registrar’s appeal no 19 of 2010
                    (“RA19/2010”)) and judgment has been reserved. On
                    27 October 2009, the plaintiff obtained an order for service of the
                    writ and statement of claim out of jurisdiction on Ostinelli and Novoselov, and
                    they were duly served. However, that order for service out of jurisdiction was
                    set aside by assistant registrar Denise Wong on 5 April 2010. That
                    decision is the subject of the appeal before me in registrar’s appeal
                    no 154 of 2010 (“RA154/2010”). However, in view of the appeal
                    against the stay of proceedings against Lush in RA19/2010, I was of the view
                    that it would be expedient to await the outcome of that appeal. I therefore
                    adjourned RA154/2010 to await the outcome of RA19/2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applications before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The defendants applied for the plaintiff’s
                    solicitor, Drew &amp; Napier, to be restrained by way of an injunction from
                    acting as counsel for the plaintiff in the present suit and/or in any
                    applications and/or appeals arising out of or made in connection with the
                    present suit and/or giving legal advice to and/or legally representing in any
                    other way the plaintiff in connection with this suit. The plaintiff applied for
                    the defendants’ application to be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The basis of the defendants’ application
                    is r 31(1) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct Rules)
                    (Cap 161, r 71, 2000 Rev Ed) (“PCR”), which reads
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Not to act against
                            client</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31. —(1) An advocate and solicitor who has acted for a client in a
                        matter shall not thereafter act against the client (or against persons who
                        were involved in or associated with the client in that matter) in the same
                        or any related matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the term “client”
                        includes a client of the law practice of which the advocate and solicitor is
                        a partner, a director, an associate or an employee, whether or not he
                        handles the client’s work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Paragraph (1) shall apply even where the advocate and solicitor
                        concerned becomes a member of a different law corporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Nothing herein shall preclude a law practice or law
                        corporation from acting against a party in a matter provided that
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) the law practice or law corporation
                            has not previously acted for the party (or for persons who were involved
                            in or associated with the party in that matter) in the same or any
                            related matter; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) any advocate and solicitor of the
                            law practice or law corporation who has previously acted for the party
                            in the same or related matter neither acts nor is involved in that
                            matter or related matter in any way whatsoever and does not otherwise
                            disclose any confidential information relating to the matter or the
                            party to any other member of the law practice or law corporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendants contended that r 31(1) of
                    the PCR displaced the common law position on this issue. It was therefore an
                    absolute prohibition against an advocate and solicitor acting against his former
                    client in the same or related matter, and was not contingent on the advocate or
                    solicitor having acquired confidential information from the client and/or that
                    there be a risk of disclosure of such confidential information. For this
                    proposition, the defendants relied on Pinsler’s observation in <em>Ethics and Professional Responsibility: A Code for the Advocate and
                        Solicitor</em> (Singapore: Academy Publishing, 2007) and <em>Law Society of Singapore v Seah Li Ming Edwin and
                        another</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 401. The defendants claimed
                    that Drew &amp; Napier had previously acted for them in the following matters
                    (“the previous retainers”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendants’
                        shareholders’ dispute with Everon which ultimately resolved through
                        the defendants’ purchase of Everon’s shares held in
                        Stainby.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Negotiations with Everon on the purchase of Everon’s shares in
                        Stainby and the terms of such purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Shareholders’ loan of US$10m from Stainby
                        to PPL and the loan agreement dated 26 June 2006 between Stainby
                        and PPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendants contended that the previous
                    retainers concern matters which are “same or related” to the
                    present proceedings, and therefore, r 31(1) of PCR provided an absolute
                    prohibition against Drew &amp; Napier from acting for the plaintiff against the
                    defendants. In particular, the defendants contended that Drew &amp; Napier acted
                    for the defendants in the previous retainers for at least a period of seven
                    months, from December 2005 to July 2006, which was also the same
                    period during which the plaintiff alleged that the defendants have made certain
                    representations to him about the shareholding in PPL and the terms of the
                    defendants’ purchase of Everon’s shares in Stainby. Therefore, by
                    providing them with legal advice in their negotiations with Everon over the sale
                    and purchase of Everon’s shares in Stainby, and by providing them with
                    legal advice on the loan agreements, the defendants contended that Drew &amp;
                    Napier acted in matters which were related if not the same as the present
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff did not dispute that Drew &amp;
                    Napier had acted for the defendants in the previous retainers as described
                    above. But the plaintiff disputed the scope of “same or related
                    matter” under r 31 of PCR. The plaintiff submitted that the basis of
                    r 31 is the protection of relevant confidential information. Therefore, the
                    matter is only “related” to the previous retainer if, by reason of
                    the previous retainer, the advocate and solicitor obtains confidential
                    information that is relevant to the present matter. For this proposition, the
                    plaintiff relied on the common law position and the Ethics Committee of the Law
                    Society of Singapore’s observations in <em>Duties to Former
                        Clients: Ethical Considerations</em> and <em>In re A
                        Firm of Solicitors</em> [1997] Ch 1. The plaintiff argued
                    that since there is no guidance as to the interpretation of r 31, there is
                    no reason for this court not to seek guidance from past case law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Applying the above principles, the plaintiff
                    contended that he never obtained any confidential information from Drew &amp;
                    Napier and is unaware of any information that Drew &amp; Napier may have
                    obtained from the defendants by virtue of their previous retainer. The
                    plaintiffs contended he had prepared his case solely on his personal knowledge
                    of the facts and/or the information obtained from documents that were obtained
                    by the plaintiff before he instructed Drew &amp; Napier in the current retainer.
                    The plaintiff further contended that the defendants failed to particularise its
                    allegations despite repeated requests from Drew &amp; Napier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Scope of rule 31 of the PCR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As may be readily observed, the main
                    contention between the parties concern the scope of r 31(1) of the PCR, in
                    particular, whether “same or related matter” must be read in the
                    light of the receipt of confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pre-PCR position/common law position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Where a solicitor acts for a client in
                    opposition to the interests of a former client, the common law position is
                    divided between a school of thought which sees the test as whether there is a
                    real conflict (<em>ie</em> where confidential information
                    would be disclosed to the subsequent client or used against the earlier client),
                    and another which saw the test as one of reasonable likelihood of such mischief
                    or prejudice occuring. This is best exemplified in <em>Rakusen v
                        Ellis, Munday &amp; Clarke</em> [1912] 1 Ch 831
                        (“<em>Rakusen</em>”), where the English
                    Court of Appeal rejected the view that there was a general principle that a
                    solicitor who has acted for a client in a particular matter cannot, under any
                    circumstances, act for the opposite party in the same matter. Cozens-Hardy MR
                    took the view that before granting an injunction order, the court “must
                    be satisfied that real mischief and real prejudice will in all human probability
                    result if the solicitor is allowed to act”. On the other hand, Buckley LJ
                    took the view that there must “exist, or may be reasonably anticipated to
                    exist, a danger of a breach of that which is a duty, an enforceable duty,
                    namely, the duty not to communicate confidential information”. That case
                    concerned a situation where one partner was acting for a client and another
                    partner unknowingly agreed to act for the opposing client in the same
                    action.</p>

          <em>In re a firm of
                        solicitors</em> [1992] QB 959, in the course of acting for a
                    company, the law firm received confidential information from its client’s
                    associated companies. Subsequently, the law firm was instructed to act for a
                    defendant in another litigation brought by the said associated companies. Parker
                    LJ preferred and applied the test as set out by Buckley LJ <em>ie</em> that the test is "whether there is or is not a reasonable
                    anticipation of mischief”. Likewise, in <em>Alrich
                        Development Pte Ltd v Rafiq Jumabhoy</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 38
                        (“<em>Alrich Development</em>”) (where
                    counsel for the plaintiffs contended that the defendant’s solicitor should
                    disqualify themselves from further acting for the defendant because a former
                    partner from the plaintiffs’ previous solicitors’ firm joined the
                    defendant’s solicitor’s firm), Chao Hick Tin J (sitting in the High
                    Court)(“Chao J”) held at [139]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion the public interest in the administration of justice is
                        sufficiently safeguarded on the test of “reasonable anticipation of
                        mischief” or in other words “reasonable likelihood of
                        mischief”. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Chao J also quoted (at [142]) para 25[c] of the Practice Directions of
                    the Law Society, which was a reply given by the Council of the Law Society to a
                    member's query:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There was no general rule that a solicitor who had acted for some
                        person either before or after a litigation began cannot in any case act for

                            satisfied that mischief would result from the solicitor so acting. If
                            there was no danger of any breach of confidence for the solicitor to act
                            for the opposite party in a particular situation, then the question of a
                            conflict of interest will not arise</em>. The decision on point is
                        the English Court of Appeal case in <em>Rakusen v Ellis,
                            Munday &amp; Clarke</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the other hand, in <em>Seet

                        (“<em>Seet Melvin”</em>), the Court of
                    Appeal at [17] adopted the position taken by Cozens-Hardy MR in <em>Rakusen</em> ([14] supra) and held that what was prohibited
                    was putting oneself in a situation where real mischief or prejudice would
                    result, not merely a mere risk or possibility of mischief or
                prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     With either approach, it may be observed that
                    the courts have identified the key interest as the protection of confidential
                    information. <em>In re A Firm of Solicitors</em>
                    [1997] Ch 1, the plaintiffs retained a firm to act for them in a
                    litigation matter. Subsequently, a partner to the firm not involved in the
                    matter left to join another firm who were later retained to act for the
                    defendants to the litigation matter. The plaintiffs therefore applied to
                    restrain the said partner from acting against them. Lightman J, after
                    considering the authorities, stated (at p9E–p10F) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… (1) The basis of the courts’ intervention is not a possible

                        the court is particularly sensitive to the need to afford the fullest and,
                        where required, special protection to such confidential information: see

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The effect of the PCR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The PCR was introduced in
                    1 June 1998 pursuant to s 71 of the Legal Profession Act
                    (Cap 161, 2000 Rev Ed) which provided that the Council of the Law
                    Society may make rules for regulating the professional conduct. Firstly I note
                    that whatever may be the position taken by the Law Society in its practice
                    directions earlier (<em>eg</em> see [15]), r 2(3) of
                    the PCR provides that the PCR “shall, to the extent of any inconsistency,
                    prevail over the Practice Directions and Rulings 1989 issued by the Law Society
                    or any additions or amendments thereto.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     A plain reading of r 31 of the PCR does
                    not support the plaintiff’s position that there is no change from the
                    common law position. Rule 31(1) simply states “[a]n advocate and
                    solicitor who has acted for a client in a matter shall not thereafter act
                    against the client (or against persons who were involved in or associated with
                    the client in that matter) in the same or any related matter.” There is
                    nothing in r 31(1) which limits “any related matter” to
                    matters where relevant confidential information has been passed. This is a new
                    rule that came into force well after the common law rule was established. There
                    is no reason to distort the meaning of a piece of subsidiary legislation to suit
                    the common rule in existence at the time it was enacted. Furthermore, this
                    interpretation fits the overall structure of r 31. While there is an
                    absolute prohibition against an advocate and solicitor acting against a former
                    client in the same or related matter (r 31(1)), an exception is made where
                    the advocate and solicitor leaves to join another firm in which situation, his
                    new firm may act against his former client in the same or related matter so long
                    as he is not involved, and does not disclose confidential information
                    (r 31(4)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Helpfully, the Ethics Committee of the Law
                    Society of Singapore released an article “Duties to Former Clients:
                    Ethical Considerations” in <em>Law Gazette</em>:
                        <em>Search &amp; Sight</em> (October 2009) commenting
                    on the application of rule 31:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Scenario
                        1</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let us first look at a simple scenario. You acted for Client A in drafting
                        a simple will a few years ago. That retainer then came to an end. You now
                        act for Client B, the Wife in a divorce matter. Client A is the Husband in
                        the divorce matter. What would you do?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The key issue in these situations is usually whether the
                        solicitor is acting against the former client “in the same or . . .
                        [a] related matter”. In some cases, it will be obvious that the two
                        matters are neither the “same” nor “related”
                        matters and the solicitor is therefore not prohibited under r 31 from
                        acting against the former client. However, in other cases, the two matters
                        may not be sufficiently distinct and a test is required to ascertain whether
                        the two matters are the “same” or
                        “related”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Scenario 1, the will and the divorce are clearly not “the same
                        matter” within the meaning of r 31(1). So r 31(1) prevents
                        you from acting for the Wife only if the divorce proceeding is
                        “related” to the Husband’s will. The mere fact that you
                        prepared the will for the Husband does not in itself place you in a position
                        of conflict if the two matters are not “related”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no guidance in the PCR on the test to be applied in determining
                        whether one matter is “related” to another matter within the
                        meaning of r 31(1). The Committee’s view is that two matters are
                        clearly related if any information which the former client previously
                        imparted in confidence to you for the purposes of the earlier matter is
                        relevant to the later matter. This, it seems to the Committee, strikes the
                        right balance between protecting the interest of the former client in having
                        his confidences preserved and the interest of the current client in being
                        permitted to engage her choice of counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Conclusion</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether a solicitor may act against a former client under r 31
                        depends on whether the current matter is the “same” as or
                        “related” to the former matter. This is always a question of
                        substance, not form, and must therefore depend on the circumstances of each
                        case. It will usually be obvious whether two matters are the
                        “same” by reason of an identity or overlap of parties, legal
                        or factual issues or subject-matter. The more difficult question is when two
                        matters are “related”. In this regard, the
                        “confidential information” test provides a useful yardstick.
                        However, in an area where substance prevails over form, this is perhaps not
                        the only yardstick. Members should therefore be aware that there could be
                        other considerations that a court may take into account in applying this
                        test, for example, the solicitor’s knowledge of the disposition of the
                        former client which is neither confidential information nor information
                        which is directly relevant to the subject-matter of the later matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff submitted that the Ethics Committee was of the view that
                    whether matters are deemed “related” would depend on there being
                    any information which the former client previously imparted in confidence to the
                    advocate or solicitor which is relevant to the later matter. I am unable to
                    agree. The question postulated was whether having acted for a client in a will
                    would disqualify the solicitor from acting for his wife in their divorce. The
                    issue was whether they constitute “related matters” under
                    r 31(1), the answer to which was not immediately apparent in this scenario.
                    What the Ethics Committee meant was that when confidential information is
                    imparted by the former client to the advocate or solicitor, and such
                    confidential information was relevant to the matter at hand, then the two
                    matters are clearly related. However, while the “confidential
                    information” test was useful, it was not the sole yardstick in
                    determining if two matters are related. In fact, upon closer scrutiny of the
                    article, it is noted that the Ethics Committee was applying the
                    “confidential information” test to a situation where the two
                    matters were not the same or obviously related, specifically the Ethics
                    Committee envisaged a scenario where a solicitor acted for a husband in the
                    drafting of a will, and subsequently, acted for the wife in a divorce matter. In
                    such a case, the “confidential information” test is a useful, but
                    not necessarily conclusive, tool in assessing whether an advocate and solicitor
                    should represent the subsequent client. For the reasons below, I found that the
                    matters in the previous retainer and the present case are obviously
                    related.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I should add that the view that r 31 is
                    not dependent on whether confidential information will be disclosed is also
                    shared by commentators including Yasho Dhoraisingam and Sivakumar Murugaiyan in
                    “Understanding the Recent Amendments to the Professional Conduct and
                    Publicity Rules” in <em>Law Gazette</em>: <em>Getting On Top Of Ethics</em> (December 2001). There,
                    the authors stated the following when addressing the amendment to r 31 to
                    include r 31(3):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It should be noted that the absolute prohibition against an advocate and
                        solicitor who has previously acted for a client in a matter to, thereafter,
                        not act against the client or other person involved in the same or related
                        matter remains. <em>This was so whether he had in his
                            possession any confidential information relevant to that
                            matter</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Likewise, Jeffrey Pinsler in <em>Ethics and Professional Responsibility: A Code for the Advocate and
                        Solicitor</em> (Academy Publishing, 2007) agrees that r 31 is
                    stricter than the common law position. At para 16-008 he states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...It will be clear that r 31 is stricter than the common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and para 16-017:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... r 31 is not concerned with whether confidential information has
                        been obtained from the client. It simply prohibits the advocate and
                        solicitor from acting against his former client unless one of the
                        qualifications in r 31(4) operates. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is my view that r 31 was not intended
                    to replicate the common law position, and for two matters to be related, it is
                    not necessary that the solicitor had received confidential information relevant
                    to the subsequent suit. In taking the ordinary meaning of the word
                    “related”, it may be useful to consider r 3.01 of the UK
                    Solicitors’ Code of Conduct 2007 (“UK code”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>3.01 Duty not to
                        act</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) You must not act if there is a conflict of interests (except in the
                        limited circumstances dealt with in 3.02).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) There is a conflict of interests if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) you owe, or your firm owes, separate duties to act in the best
                            interests of two or more clients in relation to the same or related
                            matters, and those duties conflict, or there is a significant risk that
                            those duties may conflict; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) your duty to act in the best interests of any client in relation
                            to a matter conflicts, or there is a significant risk that it may
                            conflict, with your own interests in relation to that or a related
                            matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) For the purpose of 3.01(2), <em>a related matter will
                            always include any other matter which involves the same asset or
                            liability</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It must be emphasised however that the UK Code is different from the
                    PCR; in particular, the PCR does not limit the prohibition against solicitors
                    acting in “related” matters to instances where there would be a
                    conflict of interest, or risk of it. Regard may also had to the r 1.9 of
                    the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in
                            a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a
                            substantially related matter in which that person's interests are
                            materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the
                            former client gives informed consent, confirmed in
                        writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the comments to r 1.9, it is stated that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[3] <em>Matters are "substantially related" for purposes of
                            this Rule if they involve the same transaction or legal
                            dispute</em> or if there otherwise is a substantial risk that
                        confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the
                        prior representation would materially advance the client's position in the
                        subsequent matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The interpretation of r 31 that I have
                    adopted coincides with observations of the Court of Three Judges’ in
                        <em>Law Society of Singapore v Seah Li Ming Edwin and
                        another</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 401 at [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The underlying rationale for such a rule [<em>ie</em>
                        rule 31] is to ensure that the <em>trust</em> between
                        lawyer and client is not compromised and that, on the contrary, the
                        confidence of the client is in fact maintained. <b><em>There
                            is, indeed, a larger public interest that underscores such a
                            rule</em></b>. The legitimacy of the law in general and the confidence
                        of clients in their lawyers in particular are of fundamental importance and
                        will be undermined if such a rule is not observed. <b><em>Indeed, the fact that a client may feel that he or she is let down or
                            betrayed by his or her lawyer can be very damaging to the standing of
                            the profession as a whole</em></b>. [emphasis in original in italics;
                        emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court had clearly opined that there was a larger public interest
                    beyond the need to protect against the disclosure of confidential information,
                    and that is the solicitor-client relationship of trust and public confidence in
                    the integrity of the legal profession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Turning to the facts of the present case, the
                    previous retainers and the present proceedings are “related”
                    matters, given that the previous retainers dealt with the shareholders loan and
                    price of Everon shares, the very matters which are the subject of dispute in
                    this suit. Indeed, in the hearing before me, counsel for the plaintiff quite
                    candidly conceded that the matters were “related” to the extent
                    that the previous retainers pertained to matters the subject of the present
                    litigation even though there was no confidential information at
                risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether an injunction order may be made against the particular
                advocate and solicitor, or as against the law firm</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Before me, the plaintiff contended that since
                    r 31(1) of PCR relates to a personal disqualification rule, the defendants
                    cannot seek to restrain Drew &amp; Napier (<em>ie</em> the
                    entire law firm) by way of an injunction order. In my view, this contention is
                    misguided. I agree with the defendants that by virtue of r 31(2), it is
                    irrelevant whether the solicitor concerned personally handled the client’s
                    work, so long as the client was a client of the law practice of which the
                    solicitor is a partner, director, associate or employee of. Thus, any solicitor
                    of Drew &amp; Napier would be equally prohibited from acting against a former
                    client of Drew &amp; Napier in the same or related matter, whether or not he was
                    personally involved in the earlier matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendants’ application should be taken out in a
                separate suit </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff also applied to strike out the
                    defendants’ application pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court
                    on the ground that the normal and proper course is for the application to be
                    made in separate proceedings against Drew &amp; Napier alone <em>ie</em> not in the present suit. For this proposition, the plaintiff
                    relied on <em>Diamond v Foo and others</em>
                    [2002] EWHC 979 (CH) (“<em>Diamond</em>”). As the plaintiff was not privy to the
                    defendants’ previous retainer and has no knowledge of what confidential
                    information belonging to the defendants which Drew &amp; Napier was in
                    possession of, and the defendants have refused to waive privilege over the
                    information, the plaintiff is prevented from obtaining information from his
                    solicitors with respect to the matters raised by the defendants and is thus
                    unable to respond fully to the defendants’ allegations. The defendants
                    contended that this court is in a position to decide whether Drew &amp; Napier
                    is in breach of r 31(1) of the PCR by examining the scope of Drew &amp;
                    Napier’s previous retainers with the defendants and the issues raised in
                    suit no 720 of 2009 proceedings to determine whether they are the same or
                    related matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I do not think that Lightman J in
                        <em>Diamond</em> laid down any rule that an applicant
                    for an order restraining solicitors acting for one of the parties on such basis
                    must make that application in totally separate proceedings against the
                    solicitors alone. The reason Lightman J found that the application ought to
                    be made in totally separate proceedings against the solicitors was because the
                    court would require to be informed as to what the confidential information was,
                    and that such confidential information could not be disclosed in the main
                    proceedings as the opposing party would then have access to them and all
                    confidentiality in that information would be lost. However, given my findings
                    above concerning the scope of r 31, a finding that the earlier and later
                    matters are the same or related can be made without any consideration of
                    confidential information. Furthermore, in <em>Alrich
                        Development</em> (<a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> supra), the
                    application to disqualify the law firm from acting because of an alleged
                    conflict of interest was dealt with in the substantive action
                itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For the reasons above, I grant the
                    defendants’ application in summons no 2035 of 2010 for an
                    injunction restraining Drew &amp; Napier from further acting for the plaintiff
                    in this action. It follows that summons no 2312 of 2010, in which the
                    plaintiff applied to strike out summons no 2035 of 2010, is dismissed. I
                    will hear counsel on the issue of costs.</p>
