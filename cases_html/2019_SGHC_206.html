But in brief, Aries followed up on VQ’s reply by sending a letter on 20 March 2013 to Fiberail to request for Fiberail’s consent to withdraw the DWDM-1 equipment.

However, Fiberail took a contrary position regarding the continued use of the DWDM-1 equipment in its 24 April 2013 letter to Aries. As mentioned (see [13] above), Fiberail stated that it was not the right party to give any consent for VQ to release the DWDM-1 equipment.

</div> I do not agree with Aries that this was the correct inference to be drawn from the date of the deliveries. The March 2011 delivery had to be considered together with the earlier deliveries. The fact that the bulk of the DWDM-1 equipment was delivered in 2010 supported VQ’s case, especially since the date of the initial deliveries in July 2010 corresponded with the Service Orders between VQ and Fiberail that were dated 28 and 29 June 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Aries’ case that it had a contractual relationship with VQ in mid-2010 also did not square with the email evidence supporting VQ’s account that its representatives were only introduced to Aries in November 2010. Liew gave affidavit and oral evidence that he and Lim were introduced to Suppiah at a conference in Kuala Lumpur on 2 November 2010.

</div> While he was arguably not an independent witness, his evidence did cast doubt on Aries’ case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I also note that in the 5 March 2013 letter from Aries to VQ to reclaim the DWDM-1 equipment, Aries did not assert or mention that the equipment had been delivered to VQ pursuant to a contract between these two parties. Furthermore, the letter mentioned that based on the records of BTI, the DWDM-1 equipment rightfully belonged to Aries. If the DWDM-1 equipment had been delivered to VQ pursuant to a contract between these two parties, it would have been simple enough for Aries to say so, and to request to reclaim the equipment on that basis. Also, there would have been no need for Aries to try and persuade VQ that Aries was the rightful owner of the DWDM-1 equipment. The substantive parts of the letter are set out at [58] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It was Aries that bore the burden of proving that the DWDM-1 equipment was delivered pursuant to a contract between Aries and VQ and that, therefore, VQ knew that the DWDM-1 equipment belonged to Aries when the 5 March 2013 letter was issued. On the unsatisfactory state of the evidence before me, I find that Aries has failed to discharge this burden. Accordingly, VQ was entitled to question Aries’ claim for the DWDM-1 equipment at least when the claim was initially made. I turn now to the conduct of the parties after 5 March 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The length of the conversion period</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The commencement of the conversion period</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Aries pleaded that the conversion period commenced on 31 August 2012, but submitted that the conversion period commenced when it sent the 5 March 2013 letter informing VQ that it wished to reclaim the DWDM-1 equipment. If this demand was unconditional and specific, an unconditional refusal by VQ to return the DWDM-1 equipment within a reasonable time would have evidenced a course of dealing with the equipment inconsistent with Aries’ rights over it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I first consider whether the demand in the 5 March 2013 letter was sufficiently unconditional and specific.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 This issue was considered, by way of <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Schwarzchild</span><span class="font-italic"> v Harrods Ltd </span>[2008] EWHC 521 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">Schwarzchild</span>”). The claimant’s mother had kept a safe deposit box on the defendant’s premises. The claimant’s private investigator wrote to the defendant making “a formal demand for an immediate commencement of the process to return [the claimant’s] jewellery”. The letter also stated that “failure to deal with [the] letter and to reply in a meaningful fashion” would be regarded as theft (at [8]). The defendant applied for the claim to be struck out, or alternatively that summary judgment be granted in the defendant’s favour on the basis that the claim was time-barred. Summary judgment was granted against the claimant. The claimant’s appeal against the summary judgment was allowed. At [30], Eady J considered that the demand in the letter appeared equivocal as it invited comment on a proposed procedure for the return of the equipment, and invited the recipient to “reply in a meaningful fashion”. The demand was not specific as to the property being sought, since the contents of the safety deposit box had been removed and mixed with other property more than three years before. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The demand in <span class="font-italic">Schwarzchild</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>can be compared with that in <span class="font-italic">Antariksa</span><span class="font-italic"> Logistics Pte Ltd and others v McTrans Cargo (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 250, where the letter of demand in question stated (at [91]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">unless we receive your confirmation by 3.00 pm today (12 October 2009) that you will forthwith deliver up the Containers and their contents to our clients, our clients shall have no alternative [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] but to commence legal proceedings to compel you to deliver up the same</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This was held to be an unequivocal demand for delivery up (at [91]).

</div> I find that VQ only raised this argument in its submissions as an afterthought. The affidavit and objective evidence showed that VQ did understand Aries’ 5 March 2013 letter to be a notice that it was reclaiming the DWDM-1 equipment. Liew, at para 106 of his AEIC affirmed on 16 February 2015, described himself as having received the 5 March 2013 letter “demanding the return of the DWDM 1 equipment supplied to [VQ]”.

In my view, it was likely that he did read the email. Furthermore, if there were indeed no attachment, he would have asked Aries to re-send it given that there was an outstanding issue to be resolved with Fiberail’s assistance.

</div> Yet VQ still did not inform Aries that it would return the DWDM-1 equipment to Aries. This suggested that VQ was not really waiting for Fiberail’s response or only wanted a response which would allow it to continue using the DWDM-1 equipment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I am of the view that in withholding the DWDM-1 equipment after 10 April 2013, VQ’s detention of the equipment and refusal to return it amounted to a converting of Aries’ equipment to its own use. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I also consider VQ’s argument that, in any event, it needed time to migrate the DWDM-1 equipment from VQ’s systems.

</div> Any argument that it needed time after 10 April 2013 to properly extract the DWDM-1 equipment from its systems before returning it to Aries was therefore irrelevant as VQ did not, on its own account, begin the migration of the equipment until late October 2013 and did not acknowledge Aries’ entitlement to the DWDM-1 equipment during the alleged period of migration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I now address VQ’s position that its conversion of the DWDM-1 equipment only began when Fiberail filed its initial defence on 14 May 2014 to “categorically” state that the DWDM-1 equipment did not belong to Fiberail.

</div> This submission is without merit. As discussed above, VQ knew by 10 April 2013 that Aries, and not Fiberail, was the party that purchased the DWDM-1 equipment from BTI. It also knew by 3 May 2013 that Fiberail invoked no claim over the DWDM-1 equipment, when Fiberail’s 24 April 2013 letter was sent by Aries to Liew via email as an attachment. This letter contained a clear statement on Fiberail’s part that the DWDM-1 equipment did not belong to it. In any event, a hard copy of Fiberail’s 24 April 2013 letter was handed to VQ on 19 September 2013. But VQ continued to maintain to Aries that the DWDM-1 equipment belonged to Fiberail, and sent an email to Aries on 2 October 2013 alleging that the DWDM-1 equipment had been sent by BTI to VQ pursuant to a partnership between Fiberail and VQ:

</div> However, even if the alleged migration had been completed in January 2014 and VQ had placed the DWDM-1 equipment in storage after that, the problem for VQ was that it still did not inform Aries that it was free to collect the equipment.

</div> I find that it was entitled to refuse to give an indemnity to VQ as the terms of the indemnity were too wide. For example, the letter of indemnity included an agreement by Aries to provide VQ with funds to defend proceedings taken against VQ in respect of losses caused by the return of the DWDM-1 equipment to Aries.

</div> VQ was not entitled to dictate the terms on which Aries was to reclaim its own equipment.

VQ proposed asking BTI to supervise the stocktake, condition assessment and file extraction, with BTI’s charges to be borne equally by the parties.

Offering to return the DWDM-1 equipment on the conditions that a stocktake, condition assessment and the downloading of system configuration files were to be carried out was not inconsistent with Aries’ rights over the DWDM-1 equipment. Even if VQ had agreed to return the DWDM-1 equipment on 10 April 2013 such that no wrongful conversion was committed, a stocktake and condition assessment of the DWDM-1 equipment would have had to be carried out as part of the process of the equipment’s return. There was also no suggestion that the condition requiring the configuration files to be downloaded was unreasonable in the circumstances.

</div> Liew’s supplementary AEIC also listed, at para 24, instances where Aries’ solicitors took an unexplained amount of time to follow up on correspondence with BTI or VQ. For instance, Aries’ solicitors took 33 days to reply to VQ’s email regarding BTI’s terms of reference. VQ had sent Aries an email containing VQ’s proposed terms on 17 April 2015 and Aries replied only on 20 May 2015 to accept them (see above at [88]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 While Aries’ solicitors need not immediately respond, the point is that VQ should not be held responsible for such delay or any other delay which would have advertently arisen after it acknowledged Aries’ right to the DWDM-1 equipment. I am of the view that the delays were not a result of any conduct on VQ’s part that was inconsistent with Aries’ rights over the DWDM-1 equipment. The delay in the return of the DWDM-1 equipment is therefore not inconsistent with my finding that the conversion period ended on 3 March 2015. Thus the conversion period was from 10 April 2013 to 3 March 2015 and lasted 22 months and 22 days (inclusive of 3 March 2015) (the “Conversion Period” or “CP”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The quantum of ordinary damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Broadly, the object of an award of damages for conversion is to compensate the plaintiff for the damage it has suffered. The usual approach is to equate the damage with the market value of the goods at the date of conversion: <span class="font-italic">Marco Polo Shipping Co Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport Services Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 541 at [28]–[30].

Instead, it claimed damages based on VQ’s use of the DWDM-1 equipment during the CP. The parties agreed that the proper measure of ordinary damages, based on the user principle, is the rental value of the DWDM-1 equipment over the conversion period at a rate of US$2,700 per month. This fixed rental sum might not have accounted for the depreciation of the DWDM-1 equipment even before the 5 March 2013 letter was sent. However, I adopt this sum as it has been agreed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I explain briefly the term “user principle” which Aries used in its submissions, where it cited <span class="font-italic">ACES System Development Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Yenty Lily (trading as Access International Services) </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1317 (“<span class="font-italic">Yenty</span><span class="font-italic"> Lily (CA)</span>”).

If Aries had succeeded in proving its case, I would have found that the conversion period began running from 5 March 2013 instead. This is because VQ would have known on 5 March 2013 that Aries was entitled to the DWDM-1 equipment, and its subsequent retention and use of the equipment after it received Aries’ letter of demand would have amounted to conversion. But it suffices to note that even if I were wrong, the quantum of ordinary damages in this alternative scenario would differ from the present award by little more than a month’s rent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The award of punitive damages </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether punitive damages should be awarded</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As set out in <span class="font-italic">ACB</span>, punitive damages may be awarded in tort “where the totality of the defendant’s conduct is so outrageous that it warrants punishment, deterrence, and condemnation”. Such conduct must be beyond the pale and deserving of special condemnation (at [176]).

The Court of Appeal elaborated that punitive damages serve both to punish the defendant as well as promote societal welfare (at [200]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… When it performs its retributive function, a punitive award looks backwards at the conduct of the defendant and imposes a condign sanction; however, a punitive award also looks <span class="font-italic">forward</span> by making an example of the particular defendant to deter would-be tortfeasors from committing similar transgressions, influencing societal behaviour, and allowing the victim of the wrong an avenue to vindicate his/her rights. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Punitive damages may be awarded even if a defendant’s actions are technically only negligent (<span class="font-italic">ACB </span>at [201]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Whilst it is true that the outrageous nature of the conduct often takes its colour from an intentional act on the part of the tortfeasor, and that, overwhelmingly, an award of punitive damages will only be appropriate where the defendant’s wrongdoing was intentional or consciously reckless, one can never foresee every factual permutation that might arise. There may be situations where the defendant’s conduct, though technically only negligent, was – “because of its quality or extent, or its duration or repetitiveness, or casualness or indifference, or any other reprehensible feature” (see <span class="font-italic">Bottrill</span><span class="font-italic"> v A</span> [2001] 3 NZLR 622 per Thomas J, dissenting) – so beyond the pale that it is properly characterised as outrageous. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, the single instance of negligence in <span class="font-italic">ACB </span>did not suffice to ground a finding of outrageous conduct (at [208]). The Court of Appeal found that <span class="font-italic">A v </span><span class="font-italic">Bottrill </span>[2003] 1 AC 449 was instructive in this regard. While the High Court of New Zealand had not been prepared to say that the defendant-pathologist’s conduct crossed the threshold of outrageousness, this changed after a State-ordered inquiry revealed that the defendant had a record of “an alarming rate of false positives and a persistent pattern of incompetent performance” (at [208]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consideration of cases in other jurisdictions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Before turning to the present facts, I will discuss various cases decided in other jurisdictions where punitive damages were awarded.

The respondents committed motor insurance fraud and sought to enforce default judgments for fictitious motor accidents against the appellant insurance company (“Axa”) for a sum of approximately £85,000. At [32], the English Court of Appeal described the case as “a paradigm case for the award of exemplary damages”: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… This was a sophisticated and sustained fraud involving deceit and fraudulent misrepresentation from the outset. The accidents were faked. False documentation, such as the hire agreements and medical reports, was created. The claimants themselves may not have existed. The first respondent conducted proceedings on the basis that it was authorised to do so as a firm of solicitors when it was not, thereby committing a criminal offence. Its conduct of those proceedings was cynical and abusive and through its dishonest manipulation and misuse of the court process, falsely representing that court documents had been served when they had not, the fraud very nearly succeeded. There is little doubt that if the respondents had managed to enforce the judgments they obtained against Axa, Axa would never have seen its money again.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Deterrence was necessary given the seriousness of the respondent’s conduct and the prevalence of “cash for crash” fraud, which affects policyholders who face increased insurance premiums (at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 <span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span> <span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> was a case involving trespass to land. The claimant’s father had owned a restaurant on the ground and first floor, with a function room on the first floor. A store room located on the first floor of an adjoining building formed part of the property owned by the claimant’s father and provided access to a fire escape for the function room. In 1999, the defendant company (“Brookwide”) subsumed the store room into a flat which it rented out. Brookwide also bricked up the entrance to the store room and severed the stairs of the fire escape, rendering the fire escape impossible to use. As a result, the function room of the restaurant could no longer be used, as regulations required the fire escape to be available to it. The claimant acquired the property in 2001. The trespass continued until judgment was handed down in 2010. The High Court found that this case was one of the “worst examples of its kind” where exemplary damages should be awarded because an order for the disgorgement of profits was unlikely to provide a sufficient deterrent in itself: <span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span><span class="font-italic"> v Brookwide Ltd</span> [2011]<span class="font-italic"> </span>2 All ER 38<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”) at [69].

The appellant bank had been found liable for breach of contract and conversion of the respondent debtor’s assets for failing to give notice when calling its loan and appointing a receiver. The bank’s “egregious” conduct included the filing of a misleading affidavit to obtain a receivership order (at [12] and [26]). Although the Supreme Court had reservations about some of the factors that the trial judge relied upon to justify his award of exemplary damages, the bank’s conduct was held to be a serious affront to the administration of justice; such conduct did not have to rise to the level of fraud, malicious prosecution or abuse of process to justify an award of exemplary damages (at [28]).

The appellant (“Switzer”) had seized the equipment belonging to the respondent (“Klewchuk”) in his belief that Klewchuk did not have a valid lease. It was relevant that Switzer had been legally advised that the parties’ prior written agreement had been frustrated by the enactment of new legislation and notified Klewchuk as such (at [11] and [69]). The trial judge found that frustration had not occurred, and that Switzer had carried out a secret plot to expropriate Klewchuk’s business. The Alberta Court of Appeal disagreed, and held that trial judge had erred in finding that the agreement had not been frustrated (see [21], [67] and [70]).

Two matters displayed the appellant’s “arrogant disregard for any rights the respondents may have had”. First, the appellant’s employee rejected Murray’s offer to remove the car, and towed it away notwithstanding that Murray was sitting in it. It ought to have been obvious that the employee should exercise some caution and make some inquiries as to his legal position and that to continue to remove the car was likely to produce a reaction. Second, the appellant’s employees interfered with the brake mechanism of the respondents’ car. This demonstrated the length to which the appellant was prepared to go to protect the payment of NZ$18, which Murray had already indicated his willingness to pay.

She drove her vehicle back onto the premises and parked the vehicle to prevent the vehicle from being removed. The High Court found that the first respondent’s actions had not occurred because of her ignorance of the true legal position, but because of her determination to have her way regardless (at [23]).

In this case, the defendant was embroiled in a dispute with her brother and sister-in-law to control the business entities set up by their father. The defendant unlawfully issued trespass notices against her brother and sister-in-law to prevent their entry onto one of the business premises and tried to persuade the police that she was entitled to act on behalf of one of the companies (see [198] and [199]).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 First dealing with VQ’s arguments, I am of the view that Aries was not obliged to accept Fiberail’s offer to purchase the DWDM-1 equipment. In <span class="font-italic">Uzinterimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> JSC v Standard Bank plc </span>[2008] EWCA Civ 918, the English Court of Appeal held that a claimant in conversion has a duty to minimise his losses (at [69]). Moore-Bick LJ explained the principle in the following terms (at [63]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n many cases (of which the present is an example) the Claimant is deprived of his property <span class="font-italic">temporarily</span> rather than permanently. It has long been recognised that if the Claimant in conversion recovers his property or any part of it, he must give credit for the value of what he has recovered. That being the case, <span class="font-italic">it is difficult to see why a person who has been deprived of his property should not be expected to take reasonable steps to</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">recover it</span>, thereby reducing the loss that he would otherwise suffer. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, the duty to mitigate does not mean that Aries was obliged to allow Fiberail to purchase the DWDM-1 equipment. Indeed, even though VQ pleaded that Aries had a duty to mitigate, VQ did not plead that this duty meant that Aries was obliged to sell the DWDM-1 equipment to Fiberail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 As for Aries’ submissions, in the light of my finding that Aries has not proved that VQ was aware of any alleged contract between the parties as at 5 March 2013, VQ’s reply on 20 March 2013 denying Aries’ request to reclaim the DWDM-1 equipment was not outrageous. Any admission or allusion by VQ that the DWDM-1 equipment was in the meantime being used to service contracts or customers apart from those under the Purchase Order was also not outrageous in these circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 However, I find that VQ had acted wilfully in withholding the DWDM-1 equipment after 10 April 2013, when BTI confirmed that it was Aries who had bought the equipment and Liew admitted that it was by then that VQ knew that Aries owned the equipment (and was entitled to reclaim it) (see above at [61] and [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The facts show that VQ was aware of but ignored Aries’ entitlement to the DWDM-1 equipment from an early stage. BTI’s 10 April 2013 email to VQ confirmed Aries’ ownership of the equipment, but VQ did not follow up with Aries on this email. VQ also did not accede to Aries’ request for delivery up of the DWDM-1 equipment when Aries sent VQ an email on 3 May 2013, attaching Fiberail’s 24 April 2013 letter, where Fiberail disclaimed any interest in the equipment. Even though Liew claimed he did not receive this email and the attached letter, which I did not accept (see above at [66]), a hard copy of Fiberail’s 24 April 2013 letter was physically delivered to VQ on 19 September 2013. VQ did not return the DWDM-1 equipment even after Fiberail sent its 11 October 2013 letter to Aries (copying VQ), where Fiberail affirmed the existence of the VQ-Fiberail agreement, but did not claim the equipment nor request that VQ retain it. VQ also did not acknowledge Aries’ title to the DWDM-1 equipment and right to possession after Fiberail sent VQ its draft proposal to purchase the equipment from Aries on 23 October 2013, thereby acknowledging Aries’ superior rights over the equipment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 VQ’s conduct also comprised periods of inexplicable conduct. VQ claimed that it was motivated to migrate the DWDM-1 equipment after October 2013 to “mitigate” its risk.

</div> The delay between 2 July 2014 and 19 August 2014 when its new solicitors wrote to Aries’ solicitors to offer to return the DWDM-1 equipment was perhaps due to some delay on the part of the new solicitors to act more promptly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In any event, a negative inference can be drawn from VQ’s inaction in this regard. The first inference to be drawn is that VQ did not migrate the DWDM-1 equipment by January 2014, but at some other later time, in which case it lied to the court when it claimed to have done so. In the alternative, VQ did migrate the DWDM-1 equipment by January 2014 but continued to retain the equipment, with no reasonable explanation apart from a vague suggestion that VQ had been confused by the poor advice it received from its previous solicitors to retain the equipment to preserve evidence.

</div> the fact remained that, firstly, it did not even begin the migration of the DWDM-1 equipment until late October 2013. Secondly, after the alleged completion of the migration on 24 January 2014, it still did not inform its own solicitors that it would return the DWDM-1 equipment until 2 July 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In summary, this was a situation where Aries consistently asserted a claim over the DWDM-1 equipment. However, VQ refused to return the DWDM-1 equipment for the duration of the CP of 22 months and 22 days. VQ’s conduct displayed a callous disregard for Aries’ entitlement to its property and a lack of contrition. It went beyond mere negligence. VQ’s conduct did not arise only from a lack of knowledge of Aries’ claim, or from a genuine belief in Fiberail’s entitlement to the DWDM-1 equipment. It is worth reiterating that not once did Fiberail inform VQ not to return the DWDM-1 equipment to Aries. The only logical inference that can be drawn is that VQ knowingly withheld the DWDM-1 equipment for its own purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In these circumstances, I find that VQ’s cumulative actions amounted to a sustained and intentional withholding of the DWDM-1 equipment that was sufficiently outrageous such as to justify punitive damages being awarded to Aries. While my award of ordinary damages<span class="font-italic"> </span>accounts for the <span class="font-italic">length </span>of VQ’s conversion, it does not address the <span class="font-italic">character</span> of VQ’s conduct. An award of compensation would neither adequately serve the function of sufficiently punishing and condemning VQ for wilfully and intentionally closing its mind to evidence of Aries’ claim over the DWDM-1 equipment, nor deter such conduct from taking place in the future, whether by VQ or other parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I qualify that the period of VQ’s outrageous conduct (the “Outrageous Conduct Period” or “OCP”) was not identical to the length of the CP. The CP ended only on 3 March 2015 when VQ made the Third Offer to return the DWDM-1 equipment (see above at [86]–[89]). But I find that VQ’s outrageous conduct ended prior to that date. Aries’ Mustafa acknowledged at trial that VQ’s conduct ceased to be “cynical” after the Second Offer was made on 25 February 2015.

</div>
</div> Hence, in closing submissions, Aries did not seek to establish that VQ’s offers constituted outrageous conduct justifying punitive damages. I take the view that VQ’s outrageous conduct ended when it made the First Offer on 19 August 2014 to return the DWDM-1 equipment. Although the First Offer included certain terms and conditions and a request that Aries issue VQ a letter of indemnity, the First Offer did not continue VQ’s outrageous conduct. I am of the view that the requirement of an indemnity was unwise and likely to be due to VQ’s solicitors taking an overly cautious approach. There was no other claimant and, in any event, VQ would be protected if it allowed Aries to collect the DWDM-1 equipment pursuant to a court order or judgment. The requirement of an indemnity unduly prolonged VQ’s delay in giving an unconditional acknowledgement that Aries was entitled to claim the DWDM-1 equipment. However, as mentioned, it was not outrageous to require an indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Therefore, the OCP extended from 10 April 2013 to 19 August 2014, and lasted for 16 months and 10 days (inclusive of 19 August 2014).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The quantum of punitive damages to be awarded</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I turn now to the question of the quantum of punitive damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In England, the following criteria have been advanced and accepted as relevant to this calculation: <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages </span>(James Edelman gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">McGregor</span>”) at para 13-031 <span class="font-italic">et seq</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Rookes</span><span class="font-italic"> v Barnard </span>[1964] AC 1129 (“<span class="font-italic">Rookes</span>”) at 1227–1228, Lord Devlin set out three considerations that are relevant to awards of exemplary damages. First, the plaintiff must be the victim of the punishable behaviour. Second, the award must be moderate. Third, the means of the parties are material in the assessment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The conduct of the parties is also relevant. In <span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [71], the High Court held that the defendant’s conduct in deliberately expropriating the claimant’s property, followed by no contrition, no apology and attempted cover-up by lying in evidence was relevant to the award of £60,000. This award of exemplary damages was reduced to £20,000 on appeal, as elaborated upon below at [127]. Conversely, a defendant’s apology in the witness box may well make a difference in his favour, as the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Loudon v Ryder </span>[1953] 2 QB 202 at 207.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Fifth, the adequacy of the amount awarded as compensation is relevant. As Lord Reid held in <span class="font-italic">Cassell</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Co Ltd v Broome</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[1972] 2 WLR 645 (“<span class="font-italic">Broome</span>”) at 686B, while compensatory damages are always part of the total punishment, if the sum awarded in compensation is insufficient as a punishment, the tribunal is to “add to it enough to bring it up to a sum sufficient as punishment”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The possibility of criminal penalty is also relevant, as are the positions of joint wrongdoers and multiple claimants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In <span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [83], Arden LJ reduced the High Court’s award of punitive damages by two-thirds after taking into account the following: the claimant had only acquired the property from his father in 2001 after Brookwide first expropriated the store room in 1999; the award must not be disproportionate; the High Court criticised Brookwide’s conduct in very strong terms; and Brookwide was liable to pay “a very considerable sum by way of compensation …, namely £55,000 for the loss of the store room, £213,073.50 for the loss of profits and interest on both those sums”. Arden LJ concluded that the reduced award of £20,000 in punitive damages remained a “significant sum” that marked the High Court’s and her own conclusion that Brookwide’s conduct was “a totally unacceptable way of resolving the issues as to the ownership of property in a democratic society subject to the rule of law”. The commentary in <span class="font-italic">McGregor </span>at para 13-032 criticised the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Ramzan</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> for failing to directly engage with the usual criteria for the assessment of punitive damages, apart from a “faulty reference to the relevance of a compensatory award”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Similar approaches have been taken in the other jurisdictions surveyed. In Canada, the defendant’s conduct, whether a criminal conviction may be brought and the defendant’s financial means are relevant: <span class="font-italic">King </span>at [159]–[160]. The New Zealand High Court in <span class="font-italic">Philip Moore </span>(at [246]) cited the New Zealand Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">McDermott v Wallace </span>[2005] 3 NZLR 661 (“<span class="font-italic">McDermott</span>”) at [94]–[102], which set out six principles relating to the assessment of quantum: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the claimant must be the victim of punishable behaviour; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the award should be moderate; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the means of the parties should be considered; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) awards of compensation to the claimant, whether under the criminal law or in regulatory proceedings, are relevant; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) regard must be had to the imposition of any relevant criminal penalty; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the conduct of the parties up to the time of judgment is relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 As regards the principle that awards of exemplary damages should be moderate, I set out for illustration a number of English and New Zealand cases where punitive damages were awarded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The commentary in <span class="font-italic">McGregor </span>at para 13-037 considered how the criteria of moderation applied in English cases:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Drane</span><span class="font-italic"> v Evangelou</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [1978] 1 WLR 455, the defendant-landlord invaded the maisonette he let to the plaintiff-tenant when the tenant and the woman he lived with were out. The tenant could not re-enter the premises as the doors were bolted from the inside, and the landlord moved his own in-laws into the maisonette (at 457E–457H). The landlord and his in-laws did not comply with the injunctions that the tenant was granted and did not leave until there was an application to commit them for contempt. Lord Denning MR considered this a case in which it was necessary “to teach the defendant a lesson” and upheld the award of £1,000 in exemplary damages (at 460A).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Design Progression Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Thurloe Properties Ltd</span> [2005] 1 WLR 1, a landlord breached its duty under s 1(3) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1988 (c 26) to decide whether to give consent for a tenant’s assignment of the lease within a reasonable time. Exemplary damages of £25,000 were awarded against the landlord as it operated in a cynical way designed to frustrate the tenant in obtaining its legitimate expectation of an assignment of the premises in order to extract for itself the value of the property (at [144]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Daley v Mahmood</span> [2006] 1 P &amp; CR DG10, the defendants harassed the claimants and unlawfully evicted them. The trial judge found that there had been a deliberate campaign of intimidation, harassment and threats designed to make the occupiers leave the property. Exemplary damages of £7,500 were awarded to each of the four claimants, to reflect “the seriousness and the attempt to make a speculative profit” (at D30).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In <span class="font-italic">McDermott</span> at [97], the New Zealand Court of Appeal reproduced a schedule tendered by counsel of awards in precedent cases for the benefit of practitioners.

at [97], the award of punitive damages should serve the function of punishment, deterrence or condemnation where the demands of justice are not served purely by an award of compensation (<span class="font-italic">ACB </span>at [172] and [173]). The court should consider the adequacy of any compensatory award and the existence and adequacy of any criminal and/or disciplinary sanctions that might have already been imposed (at [180]). As regards the former factor, the Court of Appeal at [178] and [179] endorsed Lord Devlin’s statements in <span class="font-italic">Rookes</span> at 1228 and Lord Reid’s statements in <span class="font-italic">Broome </span>at 685G–686B as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">178    In <span class="font-italic">Rookes</span> … Lord Devlin stressed that exemplary damages should only be awarded as a last resort, where the existing remedies are inadequate.

</div> Aries eventually dropped its claim for the disgorgement of VQ’s profits (see above at [27]). Nonetheless, I am satisfied that VQ did profit at least in part from its continued use of the DWDM-1 equipment after 5 March 2013. I accordingly find that VQ’s actions were not motivated solely by sheer intransigence. Rather, VQ had acted out of intransigence in combination with a desire to use the DWDM-1 equipment to make a profit. Such self-serving conduct for a commercial purpose would justify a reasonably sizeable award of punitive damages to deter VQ and others from similar conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Turning to the adequacy of the compensation award, I did not consider that the compensatory award of US$61,521.43 (see above at [95]) sufficed to serve the two purposes of compensation <span class="font-italic">and </span>punishment. Solely awarding compensatory damages based on the user principle in this case would encourage VQ and others to treat compensatory damages as mere business and operating costs akin to rent, especially in similar cases where the conversion is prolonged, wilful and carried out for profit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 On the other hand, Aries’ proposed quantum of S$500,000 appeared excessive as it was more than six times the ordinary damages awarded. At the same time, there was no suggestion on VQ’s part that VQ was not in a position to pay damages of that quantum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In the circumstances, I award punitive damages in the sum of S$60,000, which I consider to be moderate. This sum is in addition to the award of US$61,521.43 in compensation damages, to reflect the court’s disapprobation of VQ’s conduct, the duration of the outrageous conduct and VQ’s motive to retain the DWDM-1 equipment to make a profit. Although the awards of exemplary damages in the English and New Zealand cases set out at [130] and [131] appear mostly to be relatively lower in comparison, many of those cases were decided before 2000. Furthermore, it bears noting that the award of punitive damages should not be too low, or its deterrent value will be lost. An award of S$60,000 is necessary here to serve as a sufficient deterrent. Indeed, future cases may involve higher awards if the present award of S$60,000 is insufficient to deter similar conduct. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 For the reasons above, I award Aries ordinary damages of US$61,521.43, calculated on the basis of the agreed monthly rental of US$2,700 over the CP of 22 months and 22 days, and punitive damages of S$60,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I will hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Woo Bih Li  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeo Siew Chye Troy (M/s Chye Legal Practice) and Ong Pang Meng (M/s C K Tan &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff;<br/>Sze Kian Chuan John and Loh Hui Chen Nicola (Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP) for the defendant.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
