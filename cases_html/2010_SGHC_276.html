<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 16 March 2010, an AR of the Supreme
                    Court heard an application by the defendant to strike out the plaintiffs’
                    action on the ground of the plaintiffs’ failure to comply with an
                    “unless Order” in respect of discovery of documents. The AR
                    ordered the amended writ of summons and statement of claim struck out and the
                    action dismissed. He also ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendant the costs
                    of the application and of the action, such costs to be taxed or agreed between
                    the parties. The case was then at the stage where exchange of affidavits of
                    evidence-in-chief had been ordered and trial dates set for end March to early
                    April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiffs appealed against the above orders
                    and asked that they be given an extension of time to comply with the order of
                    court dated 30 November 2009 by filing and serving on the defendant within
                    14 days a second supplementary list of documents and an affidavit verifying the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal and
                    ordered them to pay the defendant’s costs of the appeal, such costs to be
                    taxed or agreed. The plaintiffs now appeal to the Court of Appeal against my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiffs are the joint holders of three
                    accounts opened in October 2005 with American Express Bank Limited
                    (“AEB”) which was subsequently acquired by the defendant. The
                    first account was held by the first and the second plaintiffs who are brother
                    and sister. The second account was held by the first and the third plaintiffs
                    who are brothers. The third account was held by the second and the fourth
                    plaintiffs who are wife and husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Before opening the above accounts, the
                    plaintiffs also had accounts with DBS and in October 2002, they began to
                    purchase various investment products from DBS, including structured notes and
                    dual currency investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiffs’ relationship manager in
                    the defendant was Daphne Lau (“Ms Lau”). In March 2008,
                    Ms Lau spoke to the first and the fourth plaintiffs about a structured
                    product known as 10Y NC3m Callable LIBOR Range Accrual Note (“the
                    product”), the subject of the action here. In the conversation,
                    Ms Lau referred to a previous investment and told the first plaintiff in
                    Mandarin that the product was “just like the one we did at that
                    time”. This was a reference to a LIBOR-linked structured note which the
                    first and the third plaintiffs had previously purchased from DBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiffs purchased the product, with the
                    first and the second plaintiffs investing US$500,000 through their account. The
                    first and the third plaintiffs invested US$100,000 and the second and the fourth
                    plaintiffs also invested US$100,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 4 March 2009, the plaintiffs commenced
                    the present suit in relation to the product, alleging that Ms Lau made the
                    following misrepresentations:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the product is a safe investment;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the product is 100% principal
                        protected;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c) </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">there is no risk; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">there is a guaranteed return of the
                            plaintiffs’ principal amount with a higher
                        interest.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiffs pleaded that they were conservative customers who placed
                    most of their money with the defendant in the form of fixed deposits. The
                    defendant denied these averments and alleged that the plaintiffs were
                    experienced investors who knew what they were buying. In an affidavit of 7
                    December 2009, the plaintiffs asserted that they were of the impression that
                    their investments in the product were fixed deposits with slightly higher
                    interest returns. One of the important issues for trial would therefore be the
                    plaintiffs’ experience in financial products of the nature in issue
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 15 July 2009, the plaintiffs filed their
                    list of documents which did not contain documents relating to their investment
                    experience in such structured products between October 2002 and March 2008 with
                    any bank or financial institution. On 18 August 2009, the defendant’s
                    solicitors wrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to ask for discovery of
                    such documents. However, the plaintiffs did not accede to this request. The
                    defendant therefore applied for specific discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 23 October 2009, the AR who heard the
                    application ordered the plaintiffs to give discovery as he was of the view that
                    the documents requested were relevant and necessary. The plaintiffs were given
                    three weeks (up to 13 November 2009) to comply with this
                order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiffs did not comply with the
                    AR’s order. On the last day for compliance, they applied for a reasonable
                    extension of time to comply with the said order. This application was supported
                    by an affidavit of their solicitor who merely stated that the plaintiffs would
                    file and serve an affidavit to explain their position and would send him their
                    affidavit for filing shortly as they were in Taiwan. However, the said affidavit
                    of the plaintiffs was not filed nor served and there was therefore no
                    explanation about why they required the extension of time to comply with the
                    AR’s order on discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     That same day, the defendant’s
                    solicitors wrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to ask them to comply with
                    the AR’s order by 16 November 2009 and to inform them to request an
                    urgent hearing date for their application for extension of time. There was no
                    response to this letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 20 November 2009, the
                    defendant’s solicitors inspected the court files and discovered that the
                    hearing date for the plaintiffs’ application for extension of time had
                    already been given as 30 November 2009. However, the plaintiffs had still
                    not served their application on the defendant’s solicitors. Accordingly,
                    on 24 November 2009, the defendant applied for an “unless
                    order” which was fixed for hearing on the same day as the
                    plaintiffs’ application for extension of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The next day, the plaintiffs informed the
                    court that their solicitor, Mr Leonard Loo, would be overseas from
                    25 November 2009 to 3 December 2009 and asked for an adjournment of
                    the defendant’s application. The defendant was not amenable to this
                    request. On 26 November 2009, the plaintiffs wrote to the court to state
                    that both their solicitors, Mr Leonard Loo and Mr Edwin Loo, were
                    overseas and that there would be no solicitor to attend the hearing on
                    30 November 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 30 November 2009, an AR dismissed the
                    plaintiffs’ application for extension of time and granted an
                    “unless order” to the defendant. Under this order, the plaintiffs
                    had to comply with the order for discovery by 7 December 2009, failing
                    which the writ of summons and the statement of claim would be struck out and
                    their action against the defendant dismissed. The trial dates for this action
                    had already been given as 29 March to 1 April 2010 and the parties had
                    to file and exchange their witnesses’ affidavits of evidence-in-chief by
                    15 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 4 December 2009, the plaintiffs
                    appealed against the “unless order” and the dismissal of their
                    application for extension of time. They served these notices of appeal on the
                    defendant on 7 December 2009, the last day for compliance with the
                    “unless order”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 7 December 2009, the plaintiffs also
                    filed an affidavit in purported compliance with the “unless
                    order”. In this affidavit, they disclosed four documents relating to two
                    investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As a result of this affidavit, the
                    defendant’s solicitors asked the plaintiffs’ solicitors whether they
                    intended to proceed with their appeals. On 17 December 2009, the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors replied and asked the defendant to confirm that the
                    plaintiffs had complied with their obligations under the AR’s order for
                    discovery and offered to pay costs. The defendant’s solicitors responded
                    the same day to state that only the plaintiffs would know whether they had
                    complied with the AR’s order for discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 28 January 2010, Andrew Ang J
                    heard the plaintiffs’ appeals. In the course of the hearing, the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors again asked that the defendant confirm that the
                    plaintiffs had complied with their discovery obligations and the “unless
                    order”. Andrew Ang J refused to direct the defendant to give such
                    confirmation whereupon the plaintiffs’ solicitors applied to withdraw the
                    appeals. Leave was granted and costs were ordered against the
                plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the said affidavit of 7 December 2009,
                    the plaintiffs stated as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiffs’ supplementary list of
                    documents exhibited to the above affidavit disclosed a deposit confirmation
                    dated 17 October 2002 in respect of the first and the third
                    plaintiffs’ investment in Surf Deposit 02, a statement of accounts for
                    October 2002, the final term sheet for Surf Deposit 02 and a confirmation advice
                    dated 7 July 2005 in respect of the second and the fourth plaintiffs’
                    investment in Surf Deposit 28.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The deposit confirmation for Surf Deposit 02
                    showed that there were at least three other sets of documents relating to this
                    deposit which were not disclosed by the plaintiffs. The statement of accounts
                    for October 2002 indicated that the first and the third plaintiffs had bought
                    another undisclosed investment in October 2002. The confirmation advice of
                    7 July 2005 also indicated that the plaintiffs had various bank accounts in
                    which their investments and the interest therefrom were held.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 8 December 2009, the defendant’s
                    solicitors wrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to ask that the plaintiffs
                    confirm that the first and the third plaintiffs never had any statement of
                    accounts in their possession, custody or power besides the one for October 2002
                    and that the second and the fourth plaintiffs never had any statement of
                    accounts in their possession, custody or power. The plaintiffs replied on
                    17 December 2009 saying that the plaintiffs only had the disclosed
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant then applied under section 175
                    Evidence Act (Cap. 97) to obtain discovery directly from DBS, a non-party in
                    this action. The plaintiffs opposed this application. An AR heard the
                    application and ordered DBS to provide the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     DBS complied with the order of court and
                    provided the defendant’s solicitors various documents which took up almost
                    two arch-lever files. These documents indicated that the plaintiffs had made
                    investments in structured products with DBS between October 2002 and March 2008
                    totalling almost US$5 million, most of which were not mentioned by the
                    plaintiffs. These documents included term sheets, statements of account and
                    interest payout letters addressed to the plaintiffs and/or signed by
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application before the AR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The AR who heard the defendant’s
                    application to strike out the plaintiffs’ action on the ground of the
                    plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the “unless Order” ruled
                    in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The Surf Deposits are no doubt structured products
                            falling within the ambit of the Discovery Order. The documents disclosed
                            by DBS are relevant as the structures of the Surf Deposits are similar
                            to the Product, and importantly, there were disclosed risks in relation
                            to the Surf Deposits (<em>cf</em>. the
                            representation of “no risk”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The plaintiffs had been, at the very least,
                            cavalier and reckless with regard to their discovery obligations.
                            Notwithstanding that the contents of the Discovery Affidavit are untrue,
                            default alone of the Unless Order by itself might not justify striking
                            out as: (a) a fair trial is still possible; and (b) the non-disclosure
                            was a matter of degree, as opposed to complete
                        non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    However, by arguing that they thought Surf
                            Deposits are not Structured Deposits and were outside the ambit of the
                            Discovery Order, the plaintiffs have compounded their present
                            predicament, as that is a clear attempt to mislead the court given that
                            the plaintiffs knew full well (at the time of the Discovery Affidavit
                            was filed) that Surf Deposits were structured products falling within
                            the ambit of the Discovery Order: see the Discovery Affidavit at
                            paragraphs 4 – 6. In view of the totality of the plaintiffs’
                            conduct herein, the court has little alternative but to allow the
                            defendant’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">After hearing the parties on the question of costs, the AR
                    added:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Costs of this application to be agreed if not taxed. I would reiterate
                        that if the plaintiffs had apologised to the Court for their default and not
                        sought to absolve themselves by arguing that the Surf Notes were not
                        structured products, the outcome of this hearing might have been different
                        for the reasons given at (2) above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted before me
                    that the plaintiffs had not disclosed a full list of their investments with DBS
                    for the following reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">they did not keep track of all their investments
                            with DBS;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">they were of the view that they only invested in
                            fixed deposits with DBS; and/or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">they disclosed that they invested in Surf
                            Deposits already and did not hide this fact from the
                        court.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">As a result, the plaintiffs could not keep track of their losses and
                    could only produce limited records in discovery. Although they did not manage to
                    disclose the full extent of their investments with DBS due to their poor record
                    maintenance, they did disclose that they invested in a particular investment
                    product.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Counsel for the plaintiffs went on to submit
                    that the plaintiffs were under the impression that Ms Lau referred to fixed
                    deposits in their conversation of 13 March 2008. They relied on her to
                    supply them with the documents relating to their investment with DBS. On the
                    face of the documents disclosed by the plaintiffs in their affidavit of
                    7 December 2009, none of the documents contradicted their position. The
                    October 2002 statement did not disclose a further Surf Deposit investment. The
                    plaintiffs are also prepared to give any further explanation on oath as to what
                    has happened to all their documents relating to their investment with DBS in
                    order to achieve a fair and open trial. In the circumstances, they ought to be
                    given an extension of time to file additional documents and to have their action
                    restored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiffs submitted that their case was
                    unlike that in <em>Manilal &amp; Sons v Bhupendra KJ Khan (t/a JB
                        International)</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 603 where the action was
                    struck out because a claim that certain documents were not in existence was
                    found to be untrue. That case also held that even if the defaulting
                    party’s omission was not deliberate, it had arisen out of gross negligence
                    amounting to wilfulness. The plaintiffs also argued that their case did not fall
                    within the four instances cited in <em>Alliance Management SA v
                        Pendleton Lane P &amp; Anor</em> [2008] 4 SLR 1
                        (“<em>Alliance Management</em>”) where an
                    action would be struck out. These instances are where the defaulting party has
                    deliberately or wilfully failed to comply with an “unless order”,
                    where the court has made successive orders for discovery (not “unless
                    orders”) which have not been complied with so that the default is clearly
                    contumacious, where the consequences of non-compliance with an order or rule
                    requiring discovery is such that there is a serious risk that a fair trial may
                    no longer be possible and where there are circumstances in which the deliberate
                    suppression of evidence might justify striking out even if a fair trial is still
                    possible. In the present case, ‘[w]hether or not the plaintiffs invested
                    $1 or $1 million in Surf Deposits, they have explained that they invested in
                    Surf Deposits. This is already a known fact”. The plaintiffs conceded, on
                    hindsight, that they should have kept proper records of their banking
                    relationship with DBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The defendant took quite the opposite view. It
                    submitted that the plaintiffs’ non-disclosure of their full investment
                    experience in structured products with DBS and the documents relating thereto
                    was wilful and deliberate. Their disclosure of their investments in Surf
                    Deposits 02 and 28 was selective. In particular, there was non-disclosure of the
                    first and the third plaintiffs’ investment of some US$1.4 million in Surf
                    Deposit 28. The plaintiffs could not have been unaware of the rest of their
                    investments in both Surf Deposits since the first plaintiff was the common joint
                    account holder. Moreover, the value of the undisclosed investments was
                    significantly higher than what was disclosed and it was plainly inconceivable
                    that the plaintiffs did not recall them. Significantly, a large investment of
                    about US$925,000 in Surf Deposit 09 was still ongoing as at November 2008, some
                    six months after the plaintiffs invested in the product in issue here. Surf
                    Deposit 09 is very similar to the product as they are both structured products
                    linked to the US LIBOR and both have a tenor of 10 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendant also took issue with the fact
                    that the plaintiffs objected to its application to order DBS to give disclosure
                    of the relevant documents. The documents furnished for the six-year period were
                    voluminous and it was suspicious that the plaintiffs only had the few documents
                    that they disclosed. The fact that they suffered significant losses as a result
                    of the premature termination of their investments in Surf Deposits 18 and 28
                    also contradicted their assertion that they thought the Surf Deposits were fixed
                    deposits with slightly higher interest returns. Further, the documents
                    themselves made it quite clear that the investments were Surf Deposits and not
                    fixed deposits. In any event, for the purposes of complying with the
                    “unless order”, the plaintiffs obviously knew that Surf Deposits
                    were not fixed deposits but structured products because they disclosed two Surf
                    Deposits. If the plaintiffs were unsure about the documents, they could have
                    requested DBS to furnish the details of their investments but there was no
                    evidence that any such action had been attempted. The defendant therefore
                    submitted that the plaintiffs’ conduct was calculated to suppress relevant
                    documents relating to their investment experience in structured products, a
                    central issue in the action at hand. These documents were adverse to their case.
                    At the very least, it was argued, “the plaintiffs were grossly negligent
                    and wilfully neglected to make enquiries and/or to disclose numerous relevant
                    documents”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant referred to the third and the
                    fourth instances cited in <em>Alliance Management</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) where striking out would be
                    justified. It submitted that the plaintiffs’ conduct had been
                    “nothing short of extraordinary”, that it was “difficult to
                    imagine a more egregious case” than this and that it was clear the
                    plaintiffs have no intention whatsoever of complying with their discovery
                    obligations. Striking out here is therefore justified even if a fair trial is
                    still possible. However, the defendant argued, a fair trial would not be
                    possible here. The documents suppressed were severely damaging to the
                    plaintiffs’ case. By concealing them, the plaintiffs were clearly seeking
                    to wrest for themselves an unfair tactical advantage, without regard for the
                    rules of engagement or the orders of court. Their conduct showed that they had
                    no qualms about lying on oath to avoid their discovery obligations in order to
                    advance their case. If the defendant had not been aware of their investments
                    with DBS, it was clear that the plaintiffs would have got away with their
                    non-disclosure, thereby severely prejudicing the defence of the
                action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In <em>Federal Lands
                        Commissioner v Neo Hong Huat</em> [1998] SGHC 131, the
                    defaulting party would insist that he had no documents and wait to see if the
                    other party could produce any. If the latter could, he would then admit to the
                    documents’ existence. The defendant submitted that the present case went
                    beyond even that kind of conduct because the plaintiffs refused to admit to
                    their failure even when confronted with the relevant documents. In their reply
                    affidavit, despite being confronted with the documents from DBS, the plaintiffs
                    claimed that they had complied with the discovery order and there was no
                    prejudice to the defendant as the plaintiffs had already disclosed that they
                    invested in Surf Deposits. They then went on to argue that Surf Deposits are not
                    structured products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiffs are clearly individuals of
                    considerable means. The defendant argued that they must have investments
                    elsewhere that only they knew about. Their conduct so far did not give any
                    confidence that they will take their discovery obligations seriously if their
                    action is restored. On the contrary, there is every indication that they will
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     After considering the arguments, I agreed with
                    the defendant’s submissions. On the facts here, there is a serious risk
                    that a fair trial may not be possible in the light of the hide and seek strategy
                    adopted by the plaintiffs and there is no indication that they will henceforth
                    pursue their claim honestly and fairly. In any event, even if a fair trial is
                    still possible, the deliberate suppression of highly relevant documents, which
                    on their face are clearly adverse to the plaintiffs’ position on a crucial
                    issue in their action, coupled with their unrepentant attitude, justify the
                    draconian measure of striking out the plaintiffs’ action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I therefore dismissed the plaintiffs’
                    appeal and awarded the defendant its costs of the appeal, to be taxed or
                    agreed.</p>
