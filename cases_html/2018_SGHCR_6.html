SPM Global Services Pte Ltd (“the 1st Defendant”) is a company incorporated in Singapore, in the business of the sale of sales performance management software and services. Mark Aldie Stiffler (“the 2nd Defendant”) was the Managing Director and sole shareholder of the 1st Defendant. The 1st Defendant uses and occupies the Premises as a private residence and home office of the 2nd Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant had entered into a tenancy agreement in relation to the Premises, dated 4 November 2015 (“the Tenancy Agreement”). According to the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant failed to pay rent and disavowed the Tenancy Agreement on 9 May 2016. The Plaintiff gave the Defendants a notice period of 14 days to vacate the Premises, but upon expiry of the notice period, the Defendants failed to vacate the Premises. The Plaintiff therefore commenced the present suit on 4 July 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Plaintiff repossessed the Premises on 27 January 2017, but the Defendants subsequently re-entered the Premises on 1 February 2017 without the Plaintiff’s permission. The Plaintiff thus repossessed the Premises again on 8 February 2017. On 20 April 2017, a High Court Judge ordered the deactivation of the access cards issued to the Defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The 1st Defendant underwent voluntary winding up on 5 June 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Plaintiff amended the Statement of Claim on 8 September 2017 by agreement between the parties (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>pursuant to O 20 r 12 of the Rules of Court), to include additional causes of action arising from the Defendants’ trespass of the Premises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Subsequently, the Plaintiff took out an application (“the Earlier Amendment Application”) to further amend the Statement of Claim, seeking to add various causes of action, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the 2nd Defendant had induced the 1st Defendant to breach its obligations under the Tenancy Agreement, that a certain clause of the Tenancy Agreement was unenforceable, and that the Defendants had conspired and engaged in a course of conduct to injure the Plaintiff. The Earlier Amendment Application was heard by the same High Court Judge on 13 February 2018. After the 2nd Defendant’s counsel had made submissions on the application, the Plaintiff’s counsel withdrew the application. According to the Plaintiff, the withdrawal was sought because it had emerged during the course of the hearing that there were difficulties with having too many causes of action introduced through the proposed amendments.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 9 April 2018, the Plaintiff brought the present application (“the Application”) to make several typographical and grammatical amendments to the Statement of Claim, as well as to introduce an additional cause of action against the 2nd Defendant relating to the tort of inducement of breach of contract. The 2nd Defendant contested only the amendments relating to the additional cause of action. The principal amendment being contested is found in para 15 of the Statement of Claim (“the Contested Amendment”), as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.

As such, further and/or in the alternative, the 2nd Defendant directly caused, induced and/or procured the 1st Defendant to breach its contractual obligations under the TA to furnish rent to the Plaintiff for the 2nd Defendant’s personal gain. In so doing, the 2nd Defendant did not genuinely and honestly endeavour to act in the 1st Defendant’s best interests. As a result, </span>the 1st Defendant failed and /or refused to pay rent when it first became due by 23 February 2016 and also when rent was due on the 1st day of each subsequent month (emphasis in original)</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In a contested application for leave to amend pleadings, the principles to be applied akin to those which apply if the application had been to strike out the amended pleadings (<span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 337 (“<span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</span>”) at [4]). In this regard, counsel for the 2nd Defendant, Mr Koh Junxiang (“Mr Koh”), objected to the Contested Amendment on two grounds: first, that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action; and second, that it amounted to an abuse of process.

The onus is on the Plaintiff to prove that the 2nd Defendant had acted in breach of personal legal duties to the company (citing <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala </span>at [65]). In this regard, the Contested Amendment failed to set out in any detail how the 2nd Defendant can be said to have breached any of his duties to the 1st Defendant; it was, instead, merely a bare allegation that the 2nd Defendant had “caused, induced and/or procured” the 1st Defendant’s breach for the 2nd Defendant’s “personal gain”, and that the 2nd Defendant did not “genuinely and honestly endeavour to act in the 1st Defendant’s best interests”. On the authority of <span class="font-italic">Chong Hon Kuan Ivan v Levy Maurice and others </span>[2004] 4 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Chong Hon Kuan Ivan</span>”) (which was also cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala Arthaputra</span>), such a bare allegation falls far short of disclosing any reasonable cause of action and is doomed to fail.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Wong Teck Ming (“Mr Wong”), argued that the Contested Amendment was material to defining the real questions in issue between the Plaintiff and the Defendants, and that it would be in the interests of justice to have all facts, details and causes of action pleaded and tried at the trial (citing <span class="font-italic">Wright Norman and another v Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 640 (“<span class="font-italic">Wright Norman</span>”)). Mr Wong further contended that the Contested Amendment had sufficiently pleaded the cause of action for inducement of breach of contract. This was because it was accepted by the parties that the Tenancy Agreement was a valid and binding contract between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, and that the 2nd Defendant was fully aware of the existence of the Tenancy Agreement. There were also strong grounds for inferring that the 2nd Defendant was the sole decision-maker and wielded control and influence over the 1st Defendant’s operations, including whether the 1st Defendant should release funds to the Plaintiff to settle accrued rental under the Tenancy Agreement. In Mr Wong’s view, it would be “extremely unbelievable” for the 2nd Defendant to take the position that he was <span class="font-italic">not </span>in charge of the 1st Defendant’s decisions, management and day-to-day operations.

The onus is therefore on the Plaintiff to demonstrate that the cause of action has been sufficiently pleaded in his proposed amendment. If the amendment discloses no reasonable cause of action, it should not be allowed (see <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin </span>at [4]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 <span class="font-italic">Chong Hon Kuan Ivan </span>provides instructive guidance on the sufficiency of pleadings in the specific context of pleading that a director had acted outside the scope of his office (which is, in itself, a key element of demonstrating that the director ought to be personally liable for the tort of inducing the company’s breach of contract). In that case, the court was faced with a proposed amendment to the statement of claim to plead that the defendant-directors had, with “the sole or predominant intention” of injuring the plaintiff, induced the company to terminate the plaintiff’s employment. The plaintiff had purported to particularise this claim by alleging that the defendant-directors had acted “outside the scope of their office or employment”, in view that (a) they had reached an agreement on certain specific dates to procure the termination of the plaintiff’s employment; and (b) prior to a certain board meeting, two or more of the defendant-directors had agreed to terminate the plaintiff’s contract, with one of them informing the plaintiff that he would be dismissed if he refused to accept a certain settlement proposal. The court found that the allegations that the defendant-directors’ conduct was outside the scope of their office were “mainly bare allegations” (<span class="font-italic">Chong Hon Kuan Ivan </span>at [45]). For instance, the reference to the refusal to accept the settlement proposal was not, without more, outside the scope of office of a director of the company (<span class="font-italic">Chong Hon Kuan Ivan </span>at [45]). In the circumstances, the court disallowed the proposed amendments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In my view, the Contested Amendment does not disclose a reasonable cause of action, for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 First, the Contested Amendment contained only a vague allusion to the fact that the 2nd Defendant “did not genuinely and honestly endeavour to act in the 1st Defendant’s best interests”. No particulars were furnished as to how the 2nd Defendant can be said to have breached any of his personal legal duties to the 1st Defendant, in particular, in relation to the payment of rent. The Contested Amendment therefore provided even less detail than the proposed amendments that had been rejected in <span class="font-italic">Chong Hon Kuan Ivan</span>. While Mr Wong argued that the 2nd Defendant was in all likelihood in charge of the 1st Defendant’s decisions, management and day-to-day operations (see [13] above), these did not – without more – mean that the 2nd Defendant had acted outside the scope of his office as a director of the 1st Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Second, the Plaintiff’s allegation that the 2nd Defendant had induced the contractual breach for “personal gain” is pleaded generally and without any detail. When queried on what “personal gain” was being referred to, Mr Wong explained that the “personal gain” was the benefit that the 2nd Defendant enjoyed by staying “rent-free” on the Premises without incurring liability for breach of contract (which would be incurred only by the 1st Defendant, as a separate legal entity). I make three observation on this point. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It appears that the reference to “personal gain” was meant to go towards demonstrating that the 2nd Defendant had intended to interfere with the performance of the Tenancy Agreement (which is the second element for establishing tortious liability for inducement of breach of contract pursuant to <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc </span>– see [11] above). If so, the alleged “personal gain” should be pleaded in greater detail. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It is unclear as to how the “rent-free” stay on the Premises was a “personal gain” to the 2nd Defendant. Given that the Plaintiff has pleaded that the Premises was used <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>as “a home office of the 2nd Defendant”,

On the Plaintiff’s argument, wherever such a company breaches a contract, the director should be considered to have intended to interfere with the performance of the contract in question. This is because the company would have incurred liability for contractual breach, while the director would have enjoyed the benefits flowing from such breach without incurring any accompanying liability. If such an allegation of “personal gain” were sufficient to establish a director’s intentions in inducing contractual breaches by his company, it would severely weaken the protection afforded by the principle in <span class="font-italic">Said v Butt</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I therefore disallow the Contested Amendment on the basis that it fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 My finding in the preceding section is sufficient, in and of itself, to dispose of the Application.

For one-and-a-half years, the Plaintiff had pursued the claim for unpaid rent and interim payment solely against the 1st Defendant.

</div> It was only following the 1st Defendant’s voluntary winding up that the Plaintiff attempted to “circumvent the insolvency regime” by pursuing the unpaid rent claim against the 2nd Defendant, when the 2nd Defendant was not himself a party to the Tenancy Agreement.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Mr Wong contended that the Contested Amendment did not cause any unfairness or prejudice to the Defendants which could not be compensated by costs. This was because the Contested Amendment arose from substantially the same facts that have already been pleaded. He further argued that while the ground for the new claim existed since the commencement of the present suit, this cause of action was being introduced pursuant to a “completely fresh study” of the suit by Plaintiff’s present counsel, who had taken over conduct of the matter only in November 2017. The Plaintiff should not be precluded from bringing the claim as a means of punishment for his errors or the errors of his solicitors (citing <span class="font-italic">Wright Norman </span>at [25]). While delay has been occasioned, delay <span class="font-italic">per se </span>did not amount to prejudice or injustice to the 2nd Defendant (citing <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal </span>[2010] 1 SLR 52 at [114]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In my view, the Contested Amendment does not amount to an abuse of process. I make four observations in this regard.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 First, the Contested Amendment was not a second bite at the cherry. This is borne out by an examination of the decision (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, <span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum</span>) cited by Mr Koh for the “second bite” argument. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum</span>, the amendments to pleadings were sought to be made at the appeal stage, <span class="font-italic">after</span> a full trial on the merits of the claims had been concluded. Even at such a late stage, the Court of Appeal recognised that amendments may be allowed post-judgment if there were sufficiently strong grounds to justify such amendments (<span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum </span>at [12]). However, as the amendments in question would alter the premises of the claims that had been tried by the court below, allowing the amendments would render the trial court’s findings altogether “immaterial” (<span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum </span>at [16]). This would “[deprive the Court of Appeal] of the benefits of the opinion of the court below” and require the Court of Appeal to “examine the claim almost from scratch” (<span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum </span>at [16]). It was in these circumstances that the Court of Appeal regarded the amendments as a “clear case of… seeking a second bite at the cherry” (<span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum </span>at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In contrast, in the present case, affidavits of evidence-in-chief have yet to be drafted or exchanged, and the present suit has yet to be set down and fixed for trial. The cherry has not, in a manner of speaking, been bitten at all; it follows that the Contested Amendment would not constitute a second bite at the cherry. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the withdrawal of the Earlier Amendment Application also cannot be considered the first bite at the cherry, since the application was withdrawn before its merits were determined (see [7] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Second, the Contested Amendment was not an unjustifiable attempt at “incremental litigation”. As Mr Koh relied entirely on <span class="font-italic">Antariksa</span> as a basis for the “incremental litigation” argument, it is necessary to examine <span class="font-italic">Antariksa </span>in greater detail. The key points of relevance for present purposes may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In assessing the propriety of incremental litigation, what is required is a “broad, merits-based judgment”, with an “intense focus on the facts of the case” (<span class="font-italic">Antariksa </span>at [100]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As a general rule, a litigant ought not to be deprived of an opportunity to litigate a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>claim or of his autonomy in deciding when, how and against whom he wishes to bring such a claim, although such autonomy is subject to the following limits (<span class="font-italic">Antariksa </span>at [101]–[104]):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The decision to bring claims incrementally must be both reasonable and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. The failure to bring the later claims in an earlier set of proceedings should not be due to negligence or inadvertence. Rather, the decision should be deliberate, reasoned, and sensible (from both commercial and practical perspectives), and should be sufficient to override the competing public interest in economy of litigation. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The incremental litigation must not undermine one of the aims of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judica</span><span class="font-italic">ta</span>, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, to avoid bringing the justice system into disrepute. As such, incremental litigation should not result in the duplicative determination of the same underlying issues of fact, as this would give rise to the possibility of inconsistent judgments between different courts examining the same matter.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It must be kept in mind that the above propositions were made in the context of incremental litigation being brought where <span class="font-italic">earlier proceedings</span>, including <span class="font-italic">appeals therefrom</span>, had already been concluded. Indeed, when setting out the requirements of reasonableness and <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>, the Court expressly referred to a “failure to bring the later claims <span class="font-italic">in an earlier set of proceedings</span>” (emphasis added), and the need to weigh the reasons for the amendment against the “competing public interest consideration of economy of litigation” (<span class="font-italic">Antariksa </span>at [102]). In relation to the concerns about duplicative determination of issues and the possibility of inconsistent judgments, these stem from the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>which is a doctrine aimed at precluding the bringing of litigation in relation to a matter which properly belonged to the subject of <span class="font-italic">earlier litigation</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>Against this backdrop, the limits on a party’s autonomy to pursue “incremental litigation” as identified in <span class="font-italic">Antariksa </span>ought to feature less prominently, if at all, in assessing the propriety of an amendment brought <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to any trial or adjudication of the dispute at hand. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In the present case, there has been no earlier trial or adjudication of matters relating to the dispute at hand, where the new claim could arguably have been litigated. There is no risk whatsoever of inconsistent judgments, given that the merits of the initial claims have yet to be determined. Indeed, given that affidavits of evidence-in-chief have yet to be drafted or exchanged, and the present suit has yet to be set down and fixed for trial, it is difficult to see how there can be any concerns relating to “re-litigation” or “incremental litigation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Third, there is no rule against trying to recover a single set of losses from one defendant, and to sue other defendants only if the initial action failed (<span class="font-italic">Antariksa </span>at [136]). Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Antariksa</span>, the court emphasised that this issue did not affect its decision on whether the amendments in question amounted to an abuse of process, emphasising that an action “cannot be abusive on this ground alone” (<span class="font-italic">Antariksa </span>at [136]). <span class="font-italic">A fortiori</span>, in view that the Contested Amendments are being brought <span class="font-italic">even before </span>the Plaintiff’s attempt to recover loss from the 1st Defendant has been tried and adjudicated upon, the Contested Amendment cannot be considered abusive on this ground. On a related note, any liability found under the Contested Amendment would be in relation to the 2nd Defendant’s <span class="font-italic">personal </span>liability for inducing the 1st Defendant’s breach of contract; as such, I could not see how the Contested Amendment amounted to an attempt to “circumvent the insolvency regime”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Finally, I acknowledge Mr Koh’s point that a change of counsel does not provide a <span class="font-italic">carte blanche </span>for new causes of action to be added. However, whether such amendment introducing a new cause of action is brought about by a change of counsel looking afresh at the case should rarely be determinative on its own. Of course, where the introduction of a new cause of action is sought very late in the day or only after the trial, a change of counsel would not be sufficient to justify allowing such an amendment (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Asia Business Forum </span>at [19], where the amendment was sought post-trial). This is not a standalone principle, but rather, part of the larger principle that whether an amendment ought to be allowed depends on all the circumstances of the case. In the present case, the Contested Amendment cannot be said to be brought late in the day (see [25(d)] above); against this backdrop, the fact that it has been brought only after the Plaintiff’s present counsel had taken over conduct of the matter does not assist in determining whether the amendment is an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Contested Amendment does not amount to an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I therefore disallow the Contested Amendment as it discloses no reasonable cause of action.
