</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        This was an action by the

Plaintiff, Peter Kwee Seng Chio ("Kwee") against the Defendants, Biogenics Sdn

Bhd ("Biogenics") claiming the return of RM7 million remitted in three tranches

pursuant to a Loan Agreement dated 16 August 2000. At the conclusion of a three-day trial

on 15<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> October 2002, I gave short reasons

and allowed the Plaintiff’s claim together with contractual interest and costs. The

Defendants have on 15 November 2002 appealed against my decision. I now set out my reasons

in full.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        It is the Plaintiff’s

case that the terms of the loan are found in a Loan Agreement dated 16 August 2000. The

Defendants defaulted on the loan and hence this action.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Early Negotiations</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        It is necessary to mention

in some detail the central role played by Ricky Goh ("Goh") a former director of

Grandlink Group Pte Ltd (now in liquidation) and the background dealings between Goh and

Kwee. Goh is now a bankrupt. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        At all material times, Goh

was a director with a substantial interest in Seng Hup Corporation Berhad ("Seng

Hup"), a public company incorporated in Malaysia. Seng Hup ran into serious financial

difficulties and on 9 September 1999 was placed under Special Administrators appointed

pursuant to the Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Berhad Act 1998. Consequently, Seng

Hup’s listing on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange was suspended. Goh as

"promoter" emerged with a rescue plan or scheme to save and restructure Seng

Hup. As a "promoter", Goh was required to pay the Special Administrators a

deposit of RM2 million as a commitment to the scheme. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        Under this restructuring

scheme, Goh was to "inject" an income-generating property into Seng Hup to make

it commercially viable and with a view to re-listing the company on the Kuala Lumpur Stock

Exchange. The target acquisition was the Standard Chartered Bank Building at no. 2 Jalan

Ampang, 50450, Kuala Lumpur. It was said that Goh was able to secure the purchase of the

Standard Chartered Building ("the building") at a favorable price and then lease

back the building to the bank after completion of the sale and purchase. Seng Hup would

issue fresh shares to the Defendants in exchange for the building. With the completion of

the restructuring, Seng Hup shares were expected to be re-listed and rise substantially in

value. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        In the restructuring

exercise, Goh was assisted by one Law Lee See ("Law"). Law was the managing

director of Seng Hup. Biogenics, a shelf company incorporated in Malaysia on 15 May 2000

was used by Goh as the vehicle for the sole purpose of acquiring and holding the building.

In July 2000, Goh appointed Ang Bee Kiong ("Ang") and Liow Seng Kee

("Liow") as his nominee directors and shareholders. They were the first

directors of Biogenics and each held one share, there being only two shares allotted at

that time. Both Ang and Liow were long-time employees who had worked for Goh in his

restaurant as kitchen help and cashier respectively. Both admitted that Biogenics was one

of the many companies controlled by Goh. Both also admitted that they were his nominees

and as such, were subject to the direction and control of Goh. At all material times, Ang

and Liow were also the nominee directors and shareholders of Sentowana Sdn Bhd. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        In or about April 2000,

Goh was introduced to Kwee by a long-time business associate Andrew Quek

("Quek"). Goh invited Kwee to participate in the Seng Hup restructuring scheme.

A sum of RM7 million was required for the down payment of the purchase, expenses for

securing the purchase and security deposit of RM2 million to the Special Administrators.

Kwee met Law on several occasions in the course of negotiations for the loan and

thereafter in connection with the purchase of the building. The building was purchased for

RM42 million. Quek who also testified that Law attended several meetings leading to the

conclusion of the loan corroborated Kwee’s evidence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        Kwee agreed to lend

Biogenics the RM7 million. The principal sum together with interest thereon at 3% above

the prime lending rate of one of the then top four local banks in Singapore was to be

repaid by 30 March 2001. For providing the loan, Kwee would receive a 20% interest in

Biogenics. The remaining 80% stake would be distributed amongst Goh (60%), Quek (10%) and

Law (10%). Quek explained that 10% would be earmarked for Law for his efforts in arranging

and coordinating the purchase of the building and in the management of the building. Quek

would get 10% for his role as the middleman who brought the parties together.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        As security for the loan

and 20% stake in Biogenics, it was agreed with Goh that Kwee would retain (i) all the

original share certificates of the Defendants and share transfer forms (Form 32A) executed

in escrow; (ii) directors’ resolutions for the appointment of additional directors

and approval for transfer of shares also executed in escrow and (iii) undated letters of

resignation from the two nominee directors. The loan was also separately secured by a

personal guarantee from Goh and Quek. On instructions of Kwee, Lim Lian Kee

("Lim") of M/s Chong, Chia &amp; Lim prepared the necessary documentation. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Defendants’ witness - Knowledge of the loan</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        The Defendants called

Law, Ang and Liow to testify on behalf of the Defendants. All testified that they knew

nothing about Kwee’s loan to Biogenics. Having seen and heard the three of them in

the witness box, I found them to be unsatisfactory and unreliable witnesses. There were

times when their oral evidence contradicted their written statements and with each other.

Ang’s testimony also contradicted his affidavit filed in Order 14 proceedings. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        Overall, the objective

facts in evidence discredit their testimony. The contemporaneous documents showed that Law

gave instructions to Kwee to remit RM7 million in three tranches between August and

October 2000. There were two receipts issued to Kwee that plainly acknowledged the money

as a loan to Biogenics. The receipts were prepared on the instructions of Law and signed

by Ang. Sentowana Sdn Bhd issued two other receipts and they acknowledged that the money

remitted by Kwee was "for the account of Biogenics". The fifth receipt is for

the RM2 million security deposit for the restructuring scheme. In addition to receipts,

there were exchanges of correspondence that described the loan of RM7 million as between

Kwee and Biogenics. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        The provision of security

in the factual matrix was consistent with the structure of the entire transaction where

the Defendants’ obligations as borrowers were separately secured by individuals. Ang

and Liow admitted to signing the blank transfer forms, which together with the share

certificates were handed to Law. It was Law who couriered the share certificates and duly

signed blank transfer forms to the Plaintiff as security for the loan. Kwee still has in

his hands the two share certificates pledged to him as security. Goh and Quek furnished

additional security in the form of a personal guarantee for the loan. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        Looking from their point

of view, Law, Ang and Liow at best misunderstood the situation. The other probability is

that they manufactured their recollections. Given the combined vested interest in

disclaiming the loan, the latter conclusion is in my view the more likely. Liow in his

oral testimony said that Goh who is a bankrupt "is on the run". He and Ang no

longer regarded themselves as Goh’s nominee. After Goh’s disappearance, the

directors appointed Law to handle the affairs of the company. When queried, " to whom

does the company now belong to?" Ang replied: "the three directors",

meaning himself, Liow and Saari bin Lajim who is Law’s nominee. In the witness box,

Law claimed a 40% stake in Biogenics. It is obvious that with Goh out of the picture, Law,

Ang and Liow stood to benefit from the multimillion-ringgit building owned by Biogenics.

The Plaintiff’s claim threatened to deprive them of the windfall. It is reasonable to

infer from all the objective facts in evidence, and I so find, that Law, Ang and Liow

were, at all material tines, aware of the loan between Kwee and Biogenics. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        Should a different view

be taken as to their knowledge of the loan, as a matter of law, Ang and Liow as nominee

directors would be imputed with the knowledge of the loan transaction that Goh, their

puppet master, possessed. If a person allows himself to be a mere nominee of, and acts for

another person, without the exercise of his own discretion or volition, in utter disregard

for his duties as a director of the company, that nominee director must be bound by the

notice which the other person, for whom he acts, has of the nature of the transaction.

Such was held by Ungoed-Thomas J in <i>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock (No 3)</i>

[1968] 2 All ER 1073.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        In <i>Selangor United

Rubber Estates Ltd</i>, the defendant, Cradock, had obtained a controlling interest in the

shareholding of the plaintiff company through improper use of the company’s own funds

via two nominee directors appointed by him to the company’s board. Soon afterwards,

the company was compulsorily wound up and the defendant left England. The Board of Trade

brought proceedings against the two nominee directors in the company’s name to

recover the sums improperly paid away. Finding the two directors liable for misapplication

of funds, being fixed by the court with knowledge of the defendant’s improper

purpose, Ungoed - Thomas J held: </p>

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Defendants’ case</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(i)    <u>Loan to Biogenics was from Goh</u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        It is the

Defendants’ pleaded case that they did not make or accept any loan from the

Plaintiff. In Further &amp; Better Particulars furnished on 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2002,

the Defendants stated that funds to finance the purchase of the building came from Goh

(10%) and MBF Finance Bhd (90%). Of the RM7 million remitted, the Defendants admitted to

receiving RM4.2 million from the Plaintiff but averred that the money was remitted on

behalf of Goh from whom the money was borrowed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        This alleged loan from

Goh was oral. No particulars of the terms of the alleged loan were pleaded. It was

therefore not surprising that at the trial, the Defendants led no evidence of this alleged

oral loan between Biogenics and Goh. Law’s testimony that he was told by Goh that the

latter had taken the money from Kwee (intending to imply a personal loan between Goh and

Kwee) is hearsay and inadmissible. I have already found that Ang and Liow were aware of

Kwee’s loan to Biogenics. In the result, the defence on this issue failed. </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></u>(ii)    <u xmlns="">Loan not binding on Defendants</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        In this case, the

Defendants have refused to be bound by a loan document which on the face of it was signed

on their behalf. From the terms of the loan document itself, no conclusion could be drawn

that the parties did not intend that the loan document executed by them should constitute

a legally binding contract. The terms of the loan document were typical of a commercial

agreement intended to be binding. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        It was therefore

necessary for the Defendants to overcome the general rule that extrinsic evidence is not

admissible in order to prove that the intention of the parties was other than that

appearing on the face of the document. It was for the Defendants to show that the

exception to the parol evidence rule applied in this case: s94(a) Evidence Act (cap97). </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a)    Did Ang sign on the loan document?</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        The Loan Agreement bore

Ang’s signature. The Defendants admitted that the signature of Ang on the Loan

Agreement was genuine but unauthorised. Ang said that he did not remember the occasion

where he had signed on the loan document. It was contended that the Loan Agreement was

printed on one of the many blank pieces of A4 size paper that Ang had previously

pre-signed on instructions of Goh. As this contention was not put to Kwee in

cross-examination, Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that Kwee’s account of the

creation of the loan document was not contradicted by way of cross-examination and

therefore the court should accept what Kwee said: see <i>Browne v Dunn</i> (1893) 6 R 67;

S<i>eet Melvin v Law Society of Singapore </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9219&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 2 SLR 323</a> at 338 and <i>Dr. Lo Sook

Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina &amp; Anor </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62917&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2002] 1 SLR 408</a>. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        Kwee, Quek and Lim were

hardly challenged on their respective evidence on the matter. Nevertheless, from reading

the pleadings, written statements, notes of evidence and closing submissions, it is clear

that Kwee was well aware of the issue. The rule would not apply in circumstances where

notice of the matter in issue was so distinctly and unmistakably given and it would be a

waste of time in putting questions to Kwee upon it: see <i>Browne v Dunn </i>at p71. In

any event, I did not think that the failure to comply with the rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i>

led to any prejudice.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        Having looked at the loan

document carefully, I find the Defendants’ contention completely untenable given the

positioning of the signature on the execution page relative to the format and text of the

entire document. There was no sign of manipulation of the text to accommodate the

signature. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        In any case, Lim, the

Plaintiff’s solicitor, testified that he prepared and later emailed in draft the Loan

Agreement, Deed of Guarantee and Warranty and Undertaking to the Plaintiff who printed out

the draft documents. When the loan document was handed to him by the Plaintiff, it had

only the Plaintiff’s signature on it. Quek confirmed this. Having spotted the

omission, Lim asked the Plaintiff to collect the Defendants’ signature. Kwee passed

the loan document to Quek and Goh to get it signed by the Defendants. It was later

returned to Lim with Ang’s signature on the loan document. In my judgment, I find

that Ang did sign on the loan document itself in his capacity as director of Biogenics.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(b)    Is the loan unauthorised in absence of a

resolution? </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        On the question of

authority, the Defendants argued that it was not bound by the Loan Agreement in the

absence of a resolution approving the loan and authority of Ang to bind the Defendants. It

was common ground that the power to borrow money was within the express powers of the

Defendants under the memorandum of association. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        The Defendants’

contention that, on the facts of this case, the rule in Turquand was displaced had little

weight or substance. There was no evidence as to when the Plaintiff or his lawyers had

caused a registry of companies search to be carried out on Biogenics. After the Loan

Agreement was signed but before the third tranche of the loan was disbursed, Lim had on 11

October 2000 as a matter of housekeeping asked Law to send the various documentation

required of Biogenics which included a resolution approving the loan. It may be inferred

from Law’s reply that he had asked Kwee for the wording of the resolution which Kwee

sent to Law on 24 October 2000. The Defendants did not provide the Plaintiff with a signed

resolution as promised by Law. It would, in my view, be extremely unfair to allow the

Defendants to use their own omission or failure against the Plaintiff. Besides, it cannot

be said that the transaction was one in which the Defendants did not stand to benefit even

if the Plaintiff was in any of the ways allegedly put on inquiry. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        The Defendants also

submitted that the Plaintiff ought to have been put on inquiry by the very fact that Ang

and Liow were nominee directors and shareholders. On a balance of probabilities, the

converse argument is the more likely. Biogenics was the deliberate creation of Goh for the

restructuring scheme. There was evidence as to the reason for the loan, which, in my

judgment, was initiated and arranged by Goh, and the loan document was initialled by Goh

to signify his consent to all the terms that he had negotiated and accepted in its final

form on behalf of the Defendants. Ang together with Liow were persons who were accustomed

to act on the directions and instructions of Goh. On the facts, I find that the

circumstances were not such as to put the Plaintiff upon an inquiry. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.        In <i>SAL Industrial

Leasing Ltd v Lin Hwee Guan</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46948&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 482</a>, the Court of Appeal expressed the view

that informal assent of all the directors of a company could be tantamount to a resolution

of the board. So, if an opposite view is taken that in this case the rule in Turquand was

displaced, the Loan Agreement would still bind the Defendants if there was informal

assent. It is reasonable to infer, as I do, from the objective facts in evidence that Ang

was authorised to sign the loan document even though the transaction was not formally

authorised by a resolution. It is unrealistic to reach any conclusion other than it was

carried out with the consent and knowledge of Ang and Liow. I have already found that the

directors were aware of the loan. It is not the Defendants’ case, as will be

remembered, that the security documents executed in escrow were prepared from pre-signed

A4 size pieces of paper. It was in connection with the loan that all the security

documents were created and then handed over to the Plaintiff. Having signed two

directors’ resolutions in escrow, it is likely that Ang and Liow would, if asked to

do so, have signed the resolution approving the loan. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.        Ang and Liow were

prepared to do whatever Goh required. Goh manipulated the strings and Ang and Liow

responded to the directions like puppets. Evidence of compliance is significant for the

reason that it is consistent with and hence is proof of consent or acquiescence. Ang and

Liow admitted that everything was done at the behest of Goh who had put in place the loan

to the Defendants. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        I, therefore, find that

the board had informally acquiesced in Ang’s acceptance of the Loan Agreement on

behalf of Biogenics. This was sufficient to vest authority in Ang. The Loan Agreement was

thus binding on Biogenics.</p>
