        The first appellant, Azman bin Ismail

("Azman"), the second appellant, Ruzaini bin Ajis ("Ruzaini"), and the

third appellant, Mohamed Isnin bin Saleh ("Isnin"), were convicted of

trafficking 112.91 grams of diamorphine, which were hidden in the false ceiling of an

apartment used to store and pack diamorphine. The trial judge imposed the mandatory death

sentence on them. The appellants appealed against the decision of the trial judge. After

hearing their arguments, we dismissed the appeals and now give the reasons for our

decision.</font>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background</font></p>
</i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        On 17 August 2001, officers of the Central

Narcotics Bureau ("CNB") conducted surveillance on an apartment at Cascadale, a

condominium in Upper Changi Road. At around 1.50 pm, they saw Azman going into Unit #02-02

(the "Cascadale apartment"). He left the said apartment at around 2.05 pm and

took a taxi to the Kranji MRT station. At around 2.40 pm, a van drove by the MRT station.

A person came out from the van and handed Azman a bag. Azman then boarded another taxi,

which was stopped by CNB officers at the junction of Upper Changi Road East and Upper

Changi Road West. Azman was arrested. His bag contained 30 packets of heroin. When Azman

was searched, the Cascadale apartment keys as well as $42,364.29 were found on him. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        CNB officers next arrested Ruzaini at the

pathway of the Cascadale condominium at around 3.35 pm. Both Azman and Ruzaini were then

escorted to the Cascadale apartment. The CNB officers could not enter the apartment as

Isnin, who was then in the apartment, had pressed a chair against the front door. When the

CNB officers finally entered the apartment, Isnin was in the master bedroom toilet, trying

to flush some drugs down the toilet bowl. Isnin was arrested at around 3.43 pm. He was

found to have a set of the Cascadale apartment keys in his haversack.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        When the CNB officers searched the apartment,

they found 23 packets of diamorphine above the false ceiling of the master bedroom toilet

and another 20 packets of diamorphine above the false ceiling of the kitchen toilet. The

43 packets of drugs contained 112.23 grams of diamorphine. In addition, 0.68 grams of

diamorphine were found in a plastic bowl, in an unsealed sachet and in a loose pile on the

floor of the master bedroom. Azman’s fingerprint was found on the false ceiling of

the kitchen toilet while Isnin’s fingerprint was found on the false ceiling of the

master bedroom toilet.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        Azman and Ruzini tried to distance themselves

from the drugs in the Cascadale apartment, which had been rented by the latter’s

girlfriend, Rohaizan binte Buang ("Rohaizan") on his behalf. Azman said that he

had been asked by his friend, a Malaysian Malay named "Brother", to collect VCDs

on his behalf from someone at the Kranji MRT station. He had been instructed to proceed to

the Cascadale apartment to take some money to pay for the VCDs. He went there and took

$40,000 from a bedroom. He added that he went to the kitchen for a drink before leaving

the apartment and that while he was in the kitchen toilet, he noticed that the false

ceiling above the toilet was slightly open. He climbed onto the toilet bowl and adjusted

the false ceiling board. That was why his fingerprint was found on the said ceiling board.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        Azman claimed that while he was on the way to

Kranji, "Brother" called and told him not to pay for the VCDs. Instead, he was

to collect the VCDs and hand them and the money he had collected earlier on from the

Cascadale apartment to someone who was waiting for him at the Cascadale condominium. He

said that he assumed that the bag that he collected at the Kranji MRT station contained

VCDs because he had collected VCDs on behalf of "Brother" two weeks ago. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        In the face of evidence that he had instructed

his girlfriend, Rohaizan, to rent the Cascadale apartment on his behalf, Ruzaini claimed

that he had arranged for the rental of the said apartment on behalf of

"Brother". While Azman said that "Brother" was a Malaysian Malay,

Ruzaini said that he was a Malaysian Chinese Muslim. He said that when he was arrested, he

was waiting for Azman at the garden of the Cascadale condominium as they had agreed to

proceed together to Orchard Road. He added that he had not gone into the Cascadale

apartment and that he did not know anything about the drugs which were in the apartment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        Isnin’s statements to the CNB officers

certainly shed light on the appellants’ operations. He also claimed to have acted on

the instructions of "Brother" but he described him as an Indian Muslim. In a

statement recorded on 23 August 2001, he said that Ruzaini telephoned him on the morning

of the day they were arrested to say that he needed help. He understood this to mean that

help was required for the packing of drugs. Azman also called him to ask if he was going

to "the place". He said that Azman told him that Ruzaini would also be there. On

27 August 2001, Isnin explained in another statement that he had been to the Cascadale

apartment on other occasions prior to the arrest. During his first visit, he saw Ruzaini

and his girlfriend, Rohaizan, at the apartment. Two or three days later, he went to the

Cascadale apartment to pack 50 sachets of heroin in the master bedroom. On the day before

his arrest, he went to the apartment to pack drugs again. On this occasion, Ruzaini let

him in and he, Ruzaini and Azman packed drugs together.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><u>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The trial judge’s decision</font></p></u> </i> 

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        The trial judge accepted Isnin’s evidence

that he, Azman and Ruzaini were packing drugs in the Cascadale apartment on 16 August

2001. He took the view they did not complete their task of packing drugs on 16 August

2001. As such, they had unfinished business at the apartment on 17 August 2001, the day

they were all arrested. For reasons which will be discussed in the latter part of this

judgment, the trial judge had no doubt that when the appellants were arrested, they were

in possession of the drugs in the apartment for the purpose of trafficking. That being the

case, he found them guilty of the capital charge faced by them.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The appeal</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        The main thrust of the appellants’ appeal

was that there was insufficient evidence to show that they were in possession of the

112.91 grams of diamorphine in the Cascadale apartment or that there was a common

intention in relation to drug trafficking.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        Azman’s appeal will first be considered.

He contended that the trial judge erred when he accepted Isnin’s evidence that he and

Ruzaini had packed drugs in the Cascadale apartment on 16 August 2001 or that he had

spoken to Isnin on the following day about going to the apartment again. He also asserted

that the trial judge did not give due weight to the fact that anyone could have gained

entry into the Cascadale apartment by obtaining a set of keys which had been placed in the

letter box structure and could have put the 43 packets of drugs in the said apartment.

Finally, he contended that the trial judge erred in holding that there was sufficient

circumstantial evidence to prove that he was in possession of the drugs found in the

apartment. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        The trial judge noted that when Azman was

arrested, he had the Cascadale apartment keys on him and he had just collected 30 sachets

of heroin for delivery to someone at the Cascadale condominium. After reviewing the

evidence and listening to the witnesses, he chose to believe Isnin’s evidence that

Azman had packed drugs at the Cascadale apartment on 16 August 2001 and had given

instructions, which Isnin understood to be in connection with returning to the apartment

to pack more drugs on the day they were all arrested. He pointed out that Isnin was not

seeking any advantage for himself when he made those admissions. He was not trying to

shift the blame to Azman or Ruzaini. In fact, he was also implicating himself with his

admissions. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        The trial judge pointed out that Azman’s

conduct after his arrest and his account of material events raised serious questions about

his credibility. For instance, although he claimed that he thought that the bag which was

seized from him after his arrest contained VCDs, he had in fact told the CNB officers that

he did not know of its contents when he was first questioned. Furthermore, although he

claimed to have adjusted the false ceiling board in the kitchen toilet because it was out

of place, he had first denied that he touched the ceiling board. His evidence as to how he

got the Cascadale apartment keys also left much to be desired. He claimed, inter alia, to

have taken the said keys from some plants outside the said apartment when there were no

such plants. In our view, it was not established that the trial judge erred when he

rejected Azman’s defence that he had no knowledge of the drugs in the apartment and

that he had nothing to do with the drugs found there.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        As for Ruzaini, the main grounds of his appeal

were that the trial judge should not have rejected his submission of no case to answer at

the end of the prosecution’s case, that there was insufficient evidence to prove that

he was guilty beyond reasonable doubt, that prejudicial and inadmissible evidence had been

admitted, and that it was not established that there was a common intention to traffic in

the seized drugs. He denied Isnin’s allegation that he was at the apartment on 16

August 2001 and said that he was framed because Isnin had thought that he was a CNB

informer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        For a start, it was obvious that Ruzaini had a

lot of explaining to do regarding the rental of the Cascadale apartment. It was not

disputed that his girlfriend, Rohaizan, had rented the apartment on his behalf, that she

had paid for the deposit and rental with money provided by him and that she had handed

over the keys to the apartment to him. Although Ruzaini claimed that he had arranged for

the Cascadale apartment to be rented on behalf of "Brother", Rohaizan’s

evidence was that he had said that he wanted the apartment for himself and his friends.

Her unchallenged testimony was that she had gone to the apartment on several occasions to

meet him. Furthermore, Isnin testified that Ruzaini had packed drugs with him in the

apartment previously and that he was called by Ruzaini to help pack drugs in the apartment

on the day they were all arrested. Ruzaini claimed that he had called Isnin to help him

arrange for transport but it was not put to Isnin that this was the purpose of the phone

call. Finally, Azman, who said that he was to telephone someone called "Boy" and

deliver the bag collected at Kranji to him, admitted that "Boy" was Ruzaini, who

was at the Cascadale condominium at the material time. In view of the aforesaid, the trial

judge rightly said that all these showed that Rozaini "had more to do with the

apartment than merely being Brother’s proxy for renting it". In the face of the

evidence against him, Ruhaini’s contradictory evidence did not advance his case. For

instance, he denied knowing Azman or Isnin but subsequently admitted that this was a lie.

Furthermore, he claimed that he was not at the Cascadale apartment on 16 August 2001 as he

was at a hotel in Geylang. However, no evidence was produced to support his alibi even

though such evidence could easily have been obtained from the hotel’s records. During

the hearing of the appeal, nothing credible was advanced to show that the trial

judge’s finding that Ruzaini was guilty of the charge faced by him should be

overruled.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        As for Isnin’s appeal, his counsel

submitted that there was insufficient evidence to prove his guilt. Isnin admitted that he

had packed drugs in the apartment on two previous occasions, once alone and the other time

with Azman and Ruzaini. He had in his possession the Cascadale apartment keys and his

fingerprint was on the master bedroom toilet ceiling, which concealed 23 packets of

heroin. His explanation that his fingerprint was on the master bedroom toilet ceiling

board because "Brother" had asked him to check the apartment for breakage and

damage was not believable. He had earlier said that he checked the apartment to see if

there were more drugs there as he was frightened after he found drugs in the master

bedroom. All these did not prevent him from staying on to pack drugs in the apartment.

Indeed, when the CNB officers managed to enter the apartment, he was trying to flush drugs

down the toilet bowl. There was no evidence whatsoever to counter the inference that he

was in a willing party in the plan to traffic in the drugs and that he knew about all the

drugs found in the false ceiling of the Cascadale apartment. That being the case, he

failed to establish that the trial judge’s erred by finding that he was guilty of the

charge faced by him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        It is trite law that an appellate court will

not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly against the weight of the evidence

and that in examining the evidence, an appellate court must be mindful of the fact that

the trial judge has had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses (See, for instance, <i>Lim

Ah Poh v Public Prosecutor </i><nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 713</nobr>, 719). If one looks at all the

circumstances of this case, it was not established that the trial judge had insufficient

evidence before him to prove the appellants’ common intention to traffic in the drugs

found in the Cascadale apartment or that his conclusion that the appellants were in

possession of the drugs found in the Cascadale apartment for the purpose of trafficking

was wrong. In view of this, we dismissed the appeals of all the three appellants.</font></p>
