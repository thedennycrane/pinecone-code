        Lee Seiu Kin J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    district judge against his dismissal of the appellant’s application for a
                    declaration that a nuncupative will made by the late Tan Kiok Lan
                    (“TKL”) on 16 July 2009 was her last will and testament.
                    The sole issue in this appeal is whether a nuncupative or oral will is valid
                    under the Wills Act (Cap 352, 1996 Rev Ed)(the “Wills
                    Act”). In my judgment, it is not, for the reasons set out
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The material facts are not in dispute. TKL
                    passed away on 30 July 2009 and was survived by five children. The
                    appellant is the fourth child and was TKL’s sole caregiver up until the
                    time of TKL’s death. The respondents are the remaining four of TKL’s
                    children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 2009, in anticipation of TKL’s death,
                    the appellant enlisted the services of Wills and Trusts Pte Ltd (the
                    “Company”) for TKL to make her will. The appellant asserted that
                    this was done on TKL’s instructions, but the respondents asserted
                    otherwise. They contended that TKL gave no such instructions and that the draft
                    was done without her knowledge and consent. In the alternative, one of the
                    respondents (Tan Pwee Hwa @ Lim Pwee Hwa) also contended that her “late
                    mother was very ill when the purported instructions were given for the alleged
                    draft [w]ill”. Whatever may have been the case, the issue of her
                    testamentary capacity is, in the event, immaterial in this appeal and it is
                    unnecessary for me to go further than pointing out the existence of such a
                    disagreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Nevertheless, it is not disputed that
                    instructions for a will was given on 16 July 2009 under the following
                    circumstances. On that day, an associate of the Company, Pan Sing Fong
                    (“Pan”), visited TKL and took her instructions on the will to be
                    drawn up. Because TKL’s health was failing, the appellant adduced a letter
                    obtained from the doctor attending to TKL, who certified that TKL was “of
                    sound mind and rational”. Presumably this letter was meant to prove that
                    TKL had the requisite testamentary capacity when she gave her instructions
                    regarding her will. Pan made notes of TKL’s instructions and returned to
                    his office to prepare the will. On 24 July 2009, Pan visited TKL with
                    the draft will for execution. However Pan found that TKL was tired and sleepy,
                    and he felt that it was imprudent to ask her to sign the draft will. He decided
                    to return another day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Unfortunately that opportunity never arose. On
                    30 July 2009, TKL passed away and, in the event, the draft will was
                    not executed. It is with reference to this unexecuted draft will (“the
                    Draft Will”) that the appellant now seeks a declaration. The appellant
                    argued that the instructions TKL gave to Pan amounted to a nuncupative will and
                    the resulting Draft Will comprised the details of that nuncupative will. The
                    appellant asked that the Draft Will be declared TKL’s last will and
                    testament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellant’s counsel submitted that the
                    Draft Will amounted to a nuncupative will, or evidence of it. The first question
                    is, what is a nuncupative will? In L B Curzon, <em>Dictionary of Law</em> (Pitman Publishing, 4th Ed, 1983) it is
                    defined in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Nuncupative will</b>. (<em>Nuncupare</em> = to name, declare.) A verbal testament. Abolished
                        under the W.A. 1837, s.9, except in the case of privileged wills (q.v.) made
                        by those on active service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Statute of Frauds 1676 (AD 1676
                    Cap III) (UK) (“Statute of Frauds”) altered the law regarding
                    the validity of nuncupative wills by restricting its scope. Section 19
                    thereof provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">XIX.  And for Prevention of fraudulent Practices in
                            setting up Nuncupative Wills, which have been ‘the Occasion of
                            much Perjury;’ (2) Be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That
                            from and after [24 June 1677] no Nuncupative Will shall be good,
                            where the Estate thereby bequeathed shall exceed the Value of thirty
                            Pounds, that is not provided by the Oaths of three Witnesses (at the
                            least) that were present at the Making thereof; (3) nor unless it be
                            proved that the Testator at the Time of pronouncing the same, did bid
                            the Persons present, or some of them, bear Witness, that such was his
                            Will, or to that Effect; (4) nor unless such Nuncupative Will were made
                            in the Time of the last Sickness of the Deceased, and in the House of
                            his or her Habitation or Dwelling, or where he or she hath been Resident
                            for the Space of ten Days or more next before the making of such Will,
                            except where such Person was surprized or taken sick, being from his own
                            Home, and died before he returned to the Place of his or her
                            Dwelling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It would appear that prior to the enactment of
                    the Statute of Frauds, nuncupative wills, which merely describes oral wills, had
                    been the subject of fraudulent practices. Section 19 of the Statute of
                    Frauds provides that a nuncupative will shall not be a valid will (for an estate
                    of value exceeding 30 Pounds Sterling), unless it is made in compliance with the
                    conditions specified therein. The principal requirements are: (a) it must be
                    witnessed by at least three persons; (b) the Testator must declare to the
                    persons present that such was his will; (c) it must be made “in the time
                    of the last sickness” of the Testator (described by commentators as
                        “<em>in extremis</em>”); (d) unless the
                    Testator had, on account of sudden illness, been removed from his home and had
                    died before he could return, it must be made in his home, or a place in which he
                    had resided for at least ten days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In Sir William Blackstone’s <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England</em> (A Strahan, 15th Ed
                    1809, vol 2), the law relating to nuncupative wills at the time is
                    described in the following manner at p 499:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">These testaments are divided into two sorts; <em>written</em>, and <em>verbal</em> or
                            <em>nuncupative</em>; of which the former is
                        committed to writing, the latter depends merely upon oral evidence, being
                        declared by the testator <em>in extremis</em> before a
                        sufficient number of witnesses, and afterwards reduced to writing. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     That position obtained until the enactment in
                    1837 of the English Wills Act (7 Will 4 1 Vict cap 26) (UK) (“1837 Wills
                    Act”). Section 9 of the 1837 Wills Act provided that any will not
                    made in accordance with the provisions of that Act shall not be valid
                    dispositions, except as provided in s 11 which operated in relation to
                    soldiers and seaman. Hence nuncupative wills were no longer valid for persons
                    outside those coming within the operation of s 11 and its utility was
                    therefore limited to very narrow circumstances. The 1837 Wills Act formed the
                    basis of the 1838 Indian Wills Act (Act No XXV of 1838), which is the precursor
                    to the Wills Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I turn to examine the position of the Draft
                    Will under the Wills Act. Section 6(1) of the Wills Act provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No will shall be valid unless it is in writing and executed in the manner
                        mentioned in subsection (2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the Draft Will was not executed, for it to be valid, it must come
                    within some other provision of the Wills Act that exempts it from the operation
                    of s 6(1). The only provision in the Wills Act that touches on nuncupative
                    wills is s 27, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)   Notwithstanding anything in this Act, any soldier
                        being in actual military service, or any mariner or seaman being at sea, may
                        dispose of his personal estate as he might have done before the making of
                        this Act and may do so even though under the age of 21 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)   This section shall extend to any member of any naval
                        or marine forces not only when he is at sea but also when he is so
                        circumstanced that if he were a soldier he would be in actual military
                        service within the meaning of this section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)   For the purposes of this section,
                        “soldier” includes a member of an air force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The effect of s 27(1) is to retain the
                    law relating to nuncupative wills prior to 1837 in relation to the narrow group
                    of persons falling within that provision. There is no question that TKL does not
                    fall within this group of persons. Therefore the operation of s 6(1) in
                    relation to the Draft Will is not affected by s 27. As it was not executed
                    in the manner set out in s 6(2) – it was not signed at all by the
                    testator – the Draft Will is not valid by operation of s 6(1). It
                    does not matter if it is a nuncupative will made in compliance with s 19 of
                    the Statute of Frauds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Counsel for the appellant however made a
                    further submission, based on the provisions in the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)(“ROC”). He pointed out that O 71,
                    r 46 makes provisions for nuncupative wills and therefore such a will must
                    be valid. That order provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Applications in respect of nuncupative wills and copies
                            of wills (O. 71, r. 46)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>46</b>.—(1) An application for an order
                        admitting to proof a nuncupative will, or a will contained in a copy, a
                        completed draft, a reconstruction or other evidence of its contents where
                        the original will is not available, may be made to the Court by
                        summons:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that where a will is not available owing to its being retained in
                        the custody of a foreign court or official, a duly authenticated copy of the
                        will may be admitted to proof by virtue of section 11 of the [Wills] Act
                        without any such order as aforesaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Counsel further referred to an observation in <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler SC) (LexisNexis,
                    2009) (“SCP”) relating to O 71, r 46 of the ROC, at
                    para 71/2/1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>71/2/1.  Nuncupative will</b>. A
                        nuncupative will or privileged will is a verbal testament depending only
                        upon oral evidence, being declared by the testator <em>in
                            extremis</em> before a sufficient number of witnesses and
                        afterwards reduced to writing (2 Br Comm 500). While s 27 of the Wills
                        Act (Cap 352) is restrictive in scope (ie applying only to servicemen),
                        a nuncupative will applies to any one <em>in
                            extremis</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The first point to bear in mind is that the
                    ROC is subsidiary legislation, enacted to give effect to primary legislation
                    which, in the case of O 71, r 46, is the Wills Act. The tail cannot
                    wag the dog – what is invalidated by an Act of Parliament cannot be
                    resuscitated in the ROC by the Rules Committee. It is important to understand
                    that a nuncupative will for what it is: an oral testament, which may or may not
                    be valid as a will under the Wills Act. Prior to the enactment of the Statute of
                    Frauds, there were no conditions placed on its validity as a testamentary
                    disposition. The Statute of Frauds however imposed conditions on its validity
                    and, after the enactment of the Wills Act, nuncupative wills were no longer
                    valid except in relation to persons coming within s 27 of the Wills Act.
                    Therefore the provision in O 71, r 46 on the procedure relating to
                    nuncupative wills is only relevant to the situation where a nuncupative will is
                    required to be proved in court. This can only pertain to a person within the
                    contemplation of s 27 of the Wills Act. In relation to any other person, a
                    nuncupative will is not valid and O 71 r 46 has no relevance. Seen
                    from this perspective, the observation in SCP reproduced in [13] is simply that
                    a nuncupative will applies to any one <em>in extremis</em>
                    and only valid for those falling within the s 27 of the Wills
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In conclusion, I make the following
                    observation. The formalities required of a valid will are clearly set out in the
                    Wills Act. If those formalities are not met, and unless the testator falls
                    within any statutory exception, the will is not valid. A nuncupative will is
                    therefore not valid unless it is made by a person falling within s 27 of
                    the Wills Act. There may well be circumstances in which the requirements of the
                    Wills Act prevent the disposal of the estate of a deceased person in accordance
                    with his or her last wishes. However the problem lies in ascertaining what
                    exactly are those last wishes and the legislature has taken the position that
                    obtains in the Wills Act. This policy has been in force for a very long time,
                    the primary objective of which is to guard against fraud. Insofar as this may be
                    said to operate harshly at times, I would state that any such possibility may,
                    to some extent, be ameliorated by the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146,
                    1985 Rev Ed) which provides for distribution to the children or other
                    relatives of a person who dies intestate as a result of the invalidity of his
                    will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. I will
                    hear counsel on the issue of costs.</p>
