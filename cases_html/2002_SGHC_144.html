<strong>Judgment</strong>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<u xmlns=""><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">THE CHARGES</font></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">1.        The Accused

pleaded guilty to three Charges of having committed rape against his daughter, then under

14 years of age, by having sexual intercourse with her without her consent, offences

punishable under Section 376(2) of the Penal Code. The three incidents of rape took place

in February, March and April 2001 in the Accused’s home. Section 376(2) of the Penal

Code provides for a minimum imprisonment term of eight years and a maximum imprisonment

term of 20 years. In addition, caning of not less than 12 strokes is mandatory.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">2.        The Accused

is now 38 years old. He is the natural father of the victim, the eldest among four

children. He and his wife are divorced. The victim was educated up to Primary 6 level but

did not complete her primary education. At the time of the offences, she resided with her

father.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">3.        On 12 July

2001, the victim lodged a police report alleging that she had been raped by her father

from March 2001 until 14 June 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4.        In early

2000, the Accused and his wife underwent divorce proceedings and the wife moved out of the

matrimonial flat. The four children were left in the care of the Accused until such time

as the wife was able to find suitable accommodation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">5.        In February

2001, at around midnight, the victim was sleeping in her bedroom when the Accused returned

home, seemingly upset that his wife had failed to keep an appointment with him. About ten

minutes later, the Accused woke the victim up and asked her to go to his bedroom to rub

his back. The victim did so for about half an hour. The Accused then asked the victim to

lie down on his bed. When she asked him for the reason, he merely instructed her to

comply. She did so. The Accused then closed and locked the bedroom door.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6.        He then

told the victim to take off her clothes. She was shocked and refused to do so. The Accused

raised his voice and demanded compliance. Fearful of her father, the victim hesitated. The

Accused then approached and stripped her. Without her consent, he inserted his penis into

her vagina.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">7.        The victim

was angry and sad. She cried in her bedroom. When the Accused saw her, he warned her not

to reveal the rape to anyone.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8.        In March

2001, just after midnight, the Accused told the victim to go to his bedroom. There, he

told her to strip. She obeyed him. He licked her neck and then had sexual intercourse with

her without her consent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">9.        In April

2001, the incident in March was replayed and the third rape took place.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10.        On 15 June

2001, the four children left the Accused’s home to live with their mother. On 12 July

2001, the Accused told the mother that he wanted to bring the victim for an outing. On

learning that her siblings were not going along, the victim told her mother that she did

not want to go. Upon being chided by her mother, the victim cried and told her she did not

want to be alone with the Accused as he had raped her several times.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">11.        The mother

confronted the Accused with the victim’s allegations but he denied them and alleged

that the victim must have been having sexual intercourse with other men. A police report

alleging rape was lodged that day by the victim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">12.        Three days

later, the Accused called the mother and asked her to cancel the police report, telling

her that he would not be able to pay the maintenance for the children should he be

imprisoned.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">13.        In his

statement to the police made on 5 December 2001, the Accused said (among other things):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">"For all my efforts and responsibility, my former

    wife was still trying to make my life miserable. Hence in order to get my own back, I rape

    (the victim)."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">ANTECEDENTS</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">14.        The

Accused has no criminal record.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">15.        The

Prosecution highlighted three aggravating factors in this case:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">   

  (1)         the Accused is the natural father of

  the victim;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">   

  (2)         he had a warped motive in committing

  the rapes;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">   

  (3)         the effect of the offences on the

  victim could be seen in the report dated 29 October 2001 by

  Dr                  

  Bernardine Woo of the Child Guidance Clinic which stated:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">"(The victim) has been having recurrent thoughts

      about the abuse and has been feeling sad since the abuse. She feels anxious when males are

      physically close to her and has difficulty trusting others. She also suffers from loss of

      self esteem.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Intellectual assessment done by our psychologist, Ms

      Joyce Leong, on 23.10.01 revealed an IQ of 55, which suggests that she is currently

      functioning within the Mildly Retarded range of intelligence.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(The victim) is sad and has difficulty trusting others

      since the abuse. Her mother is supportive and understanding of her difficulties. She is

      fairly consistent in her account of events and understands the nature of the abuse. She is

      fit to give testimony in court. …"</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">16.        The

Prosecution also referred to the sentences in eight previous cases of rape perpetrated by

fathers against their daughters for my guidance. It was submitted that the offences here

should attract imprisonment terms of more than the statutory minimum of eight years.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">THE MITIGATION</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">17.        The

Accused said he has pleaded guilty to the Charges. He regretted his actions and pleaded

for leniency. He tendered his apology to his daughter and sought her forgiveness. He

promised that he would never repeat such offences.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">THE SENTENCES</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">18.        In

sentencing the Accused, I made the following remarks:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">    "Mr Mesdi bin Hussain,</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">1.    You have committed a grave crime

    against your own flesh and blood and have done a great injustice to your family. Sexual

    offences committed against one’s own family members often have repercussions well

    beyond the trial. The victim may feel bad because her father has been sent to prison

    because of her complaint. Other family members may unjustly blame the victim for causing

    the incarceration of their provider. I certainly hope this will not be the case here as

    the wrongdoing here was yours and yours alone. Further, when the father is finally

    released from prison, the daughter may have to meet him within family circles again and

    perhaps re-live the pain of the rapes. Such offences must therefore be punished severely.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">2.    You said in a statement made to the

    police that you raped your daughter to exact revenge on your wife for the misery she had

    caused you. How could your 13 year old daughter be responsible in any way for any alleged

    misconduct of her mother? The consequences of adult conflict must never be visited upon

    any child. Since the innocent child has only the voice of the law to speak for

    herself/himself, the law must speak clearly and loudly to fathers who sexually abuse their

    children by imposing severe sentences.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">3.    You have pleaded guilty and spared

    your daughter the agony of having to recount the embarrassing episodes in Court and of

    having to testify against her father. You also have no criminal record. These are

    mitigating factors in your favour.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">4.    Bearing in mind the sentences

    imposed in the cases listed by the Prosecution in the Bundle of Cases, the effect of the

    rapes on your daughter and the points I have made above, I now sentence you as follows:

    for each of the three Charges on which you have been convicted, 12 years imprisonment and

    12 strokes of the cane. The sentences for the First and Second Charges are to run

    consecutively. The sentence for the Third Charge is to run concurrently with the other

    two. You will therefore receive a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane and 24 years

    imprisonment with effect from the date of your arrest, 5 December 2001."</font></p>
