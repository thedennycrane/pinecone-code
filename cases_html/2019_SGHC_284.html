It was eventually agreed that the shares were to be transferred and paid for in three tranches comprising 24,000, 22,000 and 4,000 shares respectively.

They were also introduced to Michelle and Lee, following which they were given a tour of AMP’s office and Goh’s clinic. During this, Dr Goh was generally conversant in Mandarin and all conversations between those present were conducted in Mandarin. Following this, Wang and Sun accepted Goh’s suggestion that they tour some of the “PPP” clinics with Lee.

Taken together with the parties’ agreement that the term “EBITDA” in the 1st MOU (as amended) would be calculated based on Singapore’s accounting standards, this presented a false picture of AMP’s financial health to Wang to persuade her to purchase the angel investors’ shares in AMP (“the August 2014 EBITDA representation”).

It is not a requirement for the representee to show that the misrepresentation was the sole cause for entering into the agreement: see <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23]; see also <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower </span>at para 6.09.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Several complications arise in the present proceedings as Wang’s case against Goh rested partially on instances of implied representations, silence, omissions and concealment of material facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Addressing first the issue of implied representations, it has long been understood that representations can be implied as part of what is stated by a representor. The test for an implied representation is set out in <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower</span> at para 3.04:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court has to consider what a reasonable person would understand was being conveyed by the words and conduct in question, or would infer from them. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Examples include (<span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower</span> at para 3.04):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the implied representation that a person expressing an opinion ‘knows facts which justify his opinion,’ the representation by a buyer ordering goods that he intends to pay for them, the representation by a patron at a restaurant that he has the means and intention of paying for it before he leaves, the representation implied in a claimant’s pleadings that he honestly believes he has a fair chance of success, and the implied representation by a vendor that the bidding at an auction is genuine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 One notable scenario in which implied representations have been found to arise involves situations where the representor makes a representation as to the future. While such representations are not, by themselves, actionable misrepresentations, they may amount to actionable implied misrepresentations. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">Er</span><span class="font-italic">nest Ferdinand Perez </span>at [172(b)]<span class="font-italic">, </span>the Court of Appeal, citing <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 307 at [12], opined that a person who states an intention as to the future implicitly represents that he in fact has that intention at the time the statement is made. If it can be shown that, at the time the statement of intention was made, the person who made it had no intention of doing what he asserted he would do, there would be a misrepresentation of that person’s state of mind: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>”) at para 11.040.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Mere silence alone will not suffice to found a claim in misrepresentation: <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw </span><span class="font-italic">Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another</span> [2013] 3 SLR 801 at [65]. However, silence may in certain circumstances be capable of amounting to a representation. The following passage from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd v Alacran Design Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 2 SLR 110 at [28] is instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law has always been cautious in ascribing legal significance to a party’s silence. … Silence, being passive conduct, and inherently lacking the definitive quality of an active statement, is rarely considered sufficient to amount to a representation. But the courts have also made it clear that silence can in appropriate circumstances acquire a positive content and amount to a representation. Such cases have been characterised as situations where there is a duty on the alleged representor to speak or disclose certain facts, and in cases of misrepresentation, that failure to do so renders a statement previously made by the representor false or (more rarely) itself constitutes a false statement. Such a duty may arise out of the relationship of the parties and/or other circumstances in which the silence is maintained, and is to be assessed by reference to how a reasonable person would view the silence in the circumstances. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 This makes clear that where a misrepresentation claim is brought on the basis of alleged silence, omission or concealment, the plaintiff must show that a statement made is true only with qualifications known to and withheld by the representor: <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower </span>at para 4.17. To succeed in his claim on this basis, the representee must show that the omission makes what is stated misleading: <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower </span>at para 4.19. Ultimately, the court must closely scrutinise the facts to determine that, in the circumstances, a duty to speak on the part of the representor has arisen. It is only in such situations that an actionable misrepresentation may be found from a failure to speak.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I now make some preliminary findings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 First, I find that the date of the yacht meeting, which was an issue of contention between the parties, was 15 October 2013. The date of this meeting is of some importance as it went towards whether certain representations were made on a certain date, as will be elaborated on below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The parties proceeded on the premise that the yacht meeting took place on the same day that Wang and Sun visited Goh at AMP’s office and Goh’s clinic (“the Paragon clinic”) which were both at Paragon Shopping Centre, before Wang and Sun visited two PPP clinics on the same day. Wang’s position was that the visits were on 15 October 2013, and likewise that the yacht meeting took place on 15 October 2013; they all occurred on the same day. The defendants initially accepted in their pleadings that the yacht meeting took place on 15 October 2013. It was also agreed in the affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) of Goh, Lee and Michelle and in the parties’ lead counsel’s statements that the yacht meeting was held on 15 October 2013, being the same day as the initial meetings and visits.

If the yacht meeting had occurred on 14 October 2014, it would lend credence to the defendants’ argument that the discounted share price representation had not been made, since it would have been “illogical” for Goh to continue discussing a higher share price a day after the representation was made.

I would briefly add that although both sides seemed to proceed on the basis that Wang’s visits took place on the same day as the yacht meeting, the objective evidence pointed towards Wang having met Goh on both days (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 14 and 15 October 2013). Furthermore, the yacht meeting was on one day and not both days. It is unsurprising that both sides mistakenly proceeded on the premise that all the meetings, before the 1st MOU was signed, took place on the same day as the events occurred several years ago. They had overlooked the fact that 15 October 2013 was a public holiday and the emails of 15 October 2013 referring to an intended yacht meeting on 15 October 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 There was dispute about the substance of the Mandarin version of the 1st MOU (as amended) and who drafted it. Goh testified that the Mandarin versions that he agreed to had initially been drafted by one Chen Xiaoping. However, the Mandarin version of the 1st MOU (as amended) that he eventually signed was a “fraudulent Chinese edition” that had been amended by a person named Fu Kai.

</div> Fu Kai was a Marubi employee who was apparently present at the 21 October 2013 meeting in Guangzhou but his/her exact role was disputed by the parties. Wang was not cross-examined about the identity and role of Fu Kai. When Goh and eventually Lin referred to Fu Kai in their testimonies, Wang’s position, through her counsel, was that Fu Kai was a female temporary staff who was not legally trained and who did not draft the Mandarin version of the 1st MOU (as amended).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Goh’s allegation that he did not understand the Mandarin version of the 1st MOU (as amended) that he signed was also premised on his alleged lack of proficiency in Mandarin. However, I do not find that Goh’s command of Mandarin was as weak as he suggested, even though I accept that Lin did translate Mandarin terms to him during his discussions with Wang. Loh gave evidence that Goh was proficient in Mandarin and was accustomed to using complex Mandarin words and phrases in his communications and on social media. Loh provided evidence in the form of Facebook posts made by Goh containing Mandarin idioms and poems.

</div> As against this, Goh explained that he had obtained the various Mandarin idioms and poems using Google translation software. I do not accept this explanation. Mandarin idioms often convey ideas and concepts which are not readily ascertainable from their literal meaning. It does not appear to me likely that Goh obtained these idioms by translating his intended posts from English to Mandarin with the help of translation software. The use of such software would also not explain why some of Goh’s posts were in a mixture of Mandarin and English.

</div> If Goh had indeed been using translation software, it would have made more sense to have the entire post translated, rather than the part of it which was coincidentally translated into a Mandarin idiom. Furthermore, as noted in the plaintiff’s closing submissions, there was an instance of Goh reading out and translating Mandarin terms unaided during cross-examination.

</div> Taken together, I am satisfied that Goh was untruthful about his Mandarin ability which was actually fairly good. While he may not have had the proficiency of Lin or Wang, his proficiency in Mandarin was not as poor as he claimed. He was not as incapable of communicating in Mandarin as he was attempting to convey to the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I turn now to consider the other persons involved in the case. As stated above at [5], I find that even though it was Wang who entered into the 1st MOU (as amended) and the 2nd MOU, Sun had a substantial part to play in her decisions to do so. While Sun attempted to characterise his role as being essentially passive, with Wang making most of the decisions, this was not borne out by the evidence. Sun was present at all meetings between Wang and Goh and played an active role in negotiations, even by the account of Wang’s witness, Loh.

She resigned from SCB in 2014 and currently resides in Switzerland. On 27 June 2015, Lin corresponded with Wang’s solicitors via emails (which were admitted and marked as Exhibit P18), and discussed a meeting that she attended with Wang’s solicitors. It appears that Wang contacted Lin around this period to ask Lin to assist with Wang’s legal case against the defendants. Lin initially cooperated with Wang and executed a statutory declaration dated 23 July 2015 (“Lin’s SD”, admitted and marked as Exhibit P19). However, Lin was initially reluctant to be a witness for Wang and expressed a preference not to be involved in the legal proceedings. In 2019, Lin changed her mind and contacted Wang’s solicitors to ask if they needed her assistance, copying Goh. After Wang’s solicitors declined Lin’s offer, Goh’s solicitors approached Lin to ask if she was willing to testify for Goh. Lin eventually agreed to be a witness for Goh.

As an investment banker holding the senior position of Executive Director at SCB, Lin would have been well-versed in financial concepts, particularly those such as EBITDA. She would also have been aware of the importance of ensuring that whatever she stated in her SD was accurate especially since she was aware that legal proceedings were afoot. It appears to me that Lin was attempting to temper the damage her SD might do to the defendants’ case in the guise of clarifying her evidence. The discrepancies between Lin’s SD and her later evidence led to Wang relying heavily on Lin’s SD to challenge the evidence in Lin’s AEIC and her oral evidence. Generally, I find Lin’s evidence as set out in her SD to be more credible than her evidence in her AEIC and at trial, especially given that she did not adequately explain her changes in position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I briefly define the accounting terms as used by the parties.

As stated above, the defendants’ argument rested on the premise that the yacht meeting had taken place on 14 October 2013. If that were the case, these messages would be strong evidence that Goh did not make the discounted share price representation, as it would have been unlikely that he would have continued to discuss a higher share price a day after he allegedly represented to Wang that the shares would be sold at S$500.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As stated above at [74] and [75], I find the evidence in Lin’s SD to be more credible than her account at trial. It is clear to me that Lin was not being truthful on disputed matters when giving her AEIC and oral testimony and that she was attempting to tailor her evidence to suit Goh’s case. Lin was also unable to offer any explanation as to why her account of the yacht meeting changed so radically between the time she gave her SD and when she executed her AEIC and testified at trial beyond saying that she was unaware of the importance of being accurate in her SD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I now turn to consider Lee’s evidence. While Lee’s evidence largely corroborated that of Goh’s, I do not think that that strengthened the latter’s case. Like Lin, Lee appeared to be tailoring his evidence to suit that of Goh’s in an attempt to portray a consistent account. For example, Lee echoed Goh’s account that the latter had to rely on Lin’s translations to communicate with Wang at the yacht meeting even though, as I found above at [70], Goh was actually able to converse in Mandarin. Lee was also found at trial to have what appeared to be a prepared script of answers to issues which may arise at cross-examination. I do not accept Lee’s explanation that they were simply notes he had prepared for re-examination. At the time the note was discovered on 28 May 2019 (which was admitted and marked as Exhibit P17), Lee’s cross-examination had only covered events relating to the 1st MOU (as amended). Exhibit P17, however, contains references to events relevant only to the 2nd MOU.

By representing to Wang that he had previously sold shares in AMP for a higher price (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$600–700 per share) and that he was willing to sell her shares at a discounted price of S$500, the irresistible inference to be drawn is that Goh intended to induce Wang to purchase shares in AMP at a higher price than she might have agreed to by giving her the impression that she was getting a good bargain.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Whether Wang acted on the discounted share price representation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I also find that Wang relied on the discounted share price representation in entering into the 1st MOU (as amended). Wang was not challenged during cross-examination about her reliance on the discounted share price representation. In closing submissions, Goh submitted that Wang did not rely on the discounted share price representation as: (a) Lin had previously disclosed to Wang that Lin herself had purchased AMP shares for S$350 each; (b) Wang was financially savvy and a highly successful businesswoman who would have asked for proof of historical transactions if they were important to her; and (c) the yacht meeting was the first time Wang met Goh and she had no reason to trust him.

He deliberately omitted to bring these agreements to Wang’s knowledge.

</div> However, while the figures for FY 2012 were calculated on the accrual basis, the figures for FY 2013 and FY 2014 were calculated on the cash basis. In closing submissions, Wang suggested that at the time the 1st MOU (as amended) was signed on 21 October 2013, she insisted that AMP’s EBITDA was to be calculated in accordance with Singapore’s accounting principles. As it turned out, such principles required that the package sales be accounted for on the accrual basis. Goh thus came under a duty to inform Wang about the differences between the two accounting methods.

</div> Since Wang claimed that she did not understand English, I take her case at its highest, which is that the Mandarin version of the 1st MOU (as amended) should be relied upon as reflecting what Wang understood and intended to be the true construction of the contract. The English Translations of cl 2 of Annex A to the 1st MOU and 1st MOU (as amended) are set out for reference:

The Phrase was inserted to ensure the integrity of the figures and not to change the basis of computation, and no substantive change was intended with the addition of the Phrase.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second inference is that “package sales” was removed and the Phrase was added because Wang wanted to change the basis that the pre-tax profits would be calculated on. The Phrase was added to ensure that figures would be audited based on the accrual accounting method, that being the applicable accounting standard in Singapore, and that the projected pre-tax profit would be determined on the accrual accounting basis. (Wang also relied on this argument and this interpretation of the Phrase to argue that Goh breached the 1st MOU (as amended): see below at [167]–[191].)</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The third inference is that Wang did not know what “package sales” meant and simply wanted to replace it with something she was more comfortable with, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the projected pre-tax profit was to be audited and verified by an accounting firm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The issues to be determined are: (a) whether Wang understood what the two accounting bases entailed; and (b) which basis she understood the AMP business growth representation to have been made on. As regards (a), the first and second inferences suggest that Wang understood what the two accounting bases entailed. As for (b), only the second inference would support Wang’s case that she understood the AMP business growth representation as having been made on an accrual basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In my view, Wang has not shown that the second inference is the appropriate inference to draw. On balance, I find that the first inference is best supported on the evidence. Wang knew what the term “package sales” and what the cash accounting basis referred to, and understood the AMP business growth representation to be made on that basis. This is clear from her testimony, which shows that she understood cll 1–3 of Annex A to the 1st MOU (as amended) (reproduced above at [31]) to be calculated on a cash basis (the interpretation of cll 1–3 of Annex A to the 1st MOU (as amended) is elaborated on below at [167]–[191] in relation to Wang’s breach of contract claim). Although she claimed at points not to understand what the cash accounting basis entailed, her credibility is undermined by her vacillating evidence on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 As the defendants submitted,

Nevertheless, for completeness, I briefly consider Wang’s argument in closing submissions that there had been a failure by Goh to cross-examine Wang on whether she had relied on the AMP business growth representation in entering into the 1st MOU (as amended).

In this respect, the clauses are ambiguous as to what the agreement was, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, was AMP’s EBITDA to be calculated on a cash basis or an accrual basis?

</div> It seems to me unlikely that Goh would have agreed to the quantum of the profit guarantee in cll 1–3 of Annex A to the 1st MOU (as amended) if indeed it were to be calculated on an accrual basis. This would have potentially exposed him to a significant liability should AMP’s pre-tax profit on an accrual basis fail to increase by more than S$9m in FY 14. He would have known that he could not keep the pre-tax profit on an accrual basis from Wang since that was in fact the basis used by the auditors of AMP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The issue then is how the Phrase (defined at [151] above) should be interpreted given that both English and Mandarin versions of the 1st MOU (as amended) have equal force. In my view, the interpretation that provides for consistency between the provisions is that EBITDA calculated on a cash basis would have to be based on figures audited and verified by an accounting firm to ensure the integrity of that EBITDA. To my mind, the use of the Phrase does not necessarily mean that the accrual method should be adopted for the relevant provisions in the 1st MOU (as amended). This interpretation is further buttressed by the fact that the Phrase is also found in cl 1 of the Mandarin version of the 1st MOU (as amended). It will be recalled that Wang accepted that cl 1 of Annex A to the 1st MOU (as amended) was calculated on a cash basis, and that the same basis would apply for cl 2 (see above at [154]–[158]). If the insertion of the Phrase in cll 2–3 was to ensure that the term EBITDA was calculated according to the accrual method, then it would have been inconsistent with the same phrase in cl 1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 While Goh raised allegations during the trial that the Phrase was unilaterally inserted by Wang without his knowledge and that he could not understand the Mandarin version of the 1st MOU (as amended), I do not place any weight on this argument. As stated above at [69], this was an unpleaded allegation raised for the first time at trial. As for Goh’s inability to understand the agreement, I have already found above that he was untruthful about his Mandarin ability (see [70] above). It does not seem to me likely that he signed the Mandarin version of the 1st MOU (as amended) without understanding it or at least obtaining the benefit of a translation given that it specifies that both versions have the same force of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Accordingly, I am not persuaded by Wang’s argument that previous drafts of the 1st MOU (as amended) support her contention that EBITDA was to be calculated on an accrual basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 It is still an open question whether draft agreements, which are essentially evidence of pre-contract negotiations, are admissible for the purposes of contractual interpretation: see <span class="font-italic">Xia </span><span class="font-italic">Zhengyan v Geng Changqing </span>[2015] 3 SLR 732 at [62]. This issue was not squarely addressed by parties in their submissions. In any event, I am of the view that the draft agreements are at best equivocal as to the proper interpretation to be accorded to cll 1–3 of Annex A to the 1st MOU (as amended) and are unhelpful in determining whether EBITDA was to be calculated on a cash basis or accrual basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 In the English version of the 1st MOU, which was signed by Wang on 17 October 2013, cll 2 and 3 of Annex A stated:

This would go against the grain of the Phrase in the English Translation of the 1st MOU (as amended), which I found above at [177] to have been inserted by the parties to ensure the integrity of the financial figures used in calculating the profit guarantee. Taken to its logical extreme, Goh’s argument would render any manipulation of AMP’s financial performance beyond reproach so long as he could get an accounting firm to sign off on this.

The inference to be drawn from this is that Goh was aware that the EBITDA figure of S$11,867,000 had been communicated to Wang and intended for her to rely on it in her future investment decisions relating to AMP. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Whether Wang was induced by the August 2014 EBITDA representation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 I am also satisfied that Wang has proved that she was induced by the August 2014 EBITDA representation to enter into the 2nd MOU.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 The materiality of a representation is a factor to be considered when determining whether a representee was indeed induced.

The August 2014 EBITDA representation clearly satisfies the requirement of materiality. AMP’s financial performance was one of the metrics influencing Wang’s decision in entering into the 2nd MOU to further invest S$22.5m in AMP. It is evident from Goh’s email considered above at [208] that he shared a similar view. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 I turn now to consider some of the evidence relied on by Goh to show that Wang was not induced by the August 2014 EBITDA representation to enter into the 2nd MOU. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 First, Goh submitted that Wang did not seek confirmation of AMP’s EBITDA for FY 2014 and did not ask to see the management accounts referenced in the 1 August 2014 email from Lin.

</div> Seen in this context, I do not think that the evidence relied on by Goh warrants an inference that Wang was not induced by the August 2014 EBITDA representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 With respect, I do not think Wang’s failure to independently verify AMP’s EBITDA for FY 2014 justifies an inference that she did not rely on the August 2014 EBITDA representation at all. To reiterate, it is sufficient for Wang to demonstrate that the misrepresentation operated on her mind and caused her, or helped to cause her, to enter into the 2nd MOU: <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>para 6.09.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 I also take guidance from the Court of Appeal’s statements in <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20]. The respondents in <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>were experienced businessmen who would have made their own evaluation of the prospects of investing in the company. Nonetheless, they could still have been induced by the false representations that were made to them, including the representation that the company and its subsidiaries were more profitable than they actually were. The most that could be said was that the respondents had relied partly on their own knowledge and expertise, and partly on the representations made to them. Even if this was so, their misrepresentation claim would still have succeeded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 In the present case, Wang’s failure to follow up on or verify the August 2014 EBITDA representation demonstrates that she trusted Goh. There is no evidence to suggest that other factors operated on her decision to enter into the 2nd MOU such that Wang did not rely on the August 2014 EBITDA representation. I therefore find that this limb has been made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) Whether the August 2014 EBITDA representation was made fraudulently</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 I find that the August 2014 EBITDA representation was made fraudulently. Goh would have known that the EBITDA figure of S$11,867,000 provided to Wang was only achievable through an impermissible manipulation of AMP’s accounts through the use of backdated resolutions. Goh thus acted fraudulently in making the August 2014 EBITDA representation. It follows that Wang has made out her claim against Goh for fraudulent misrepresentation in respect of the August 2014 EBITDA representation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"> (2) The AI share price representation</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Whether the AI share price representation was made</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 The crux of Wang’s claim is that one of the matters discussed during the 8 September 2014 meeting was her potential buyout of the angel investors’ stake in AMP.

However, the mechanism was for the angel investors to sell their shares to Goh and then for Goh to sell those shares to Wang. This mechanism was premised on the explanation that Goh had told Wang: namely, that the angel investors had to sell their shares to him because of certain contractual rights of his. However, the truth was that Goh wanted to hide the fact that he was making the S$100 difference in prices. Although the principle of <span class="font-italic">caveat emptor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>would apply, this is not a case where Goh had simply remained silent as to what price the angel investors would sell their shares at. Had he done so, Goh might have been entitled to pocket the difference. However, the sale was in substance a sale from the angel investors to Wang but the mechanism was to go through Goh. Furthermore, in this case, Goh did misrepresent that the angel investors would only accept S$450 per share. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Whether Wang was induced by the AI share price representation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 Goh asserted that Wang was not induced by the AI share price representation to enter into the 2nd MOU.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 I first address the arguments at [232(a)] and [232(b)]. To my mind, these arguments are illogical and ought to be rejected. The chief purpose of the 2nd MOU was for Wang to buy out the angel investors’ shareholdings in AMP (see [17] above). As mentioned, this was not a transaction where Wang was simply purchasing shares in AMP from Goh. The terms of the 2nd MOU make this clear:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">For [AMP] shares:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.    [Wang] will buy all 50,000 shares ([Reis] &amp; Minority shareholders) at S$450.00 from [Goh]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The price at which the angel investors were to sell their shares in AMP would clearly have been an important factor to Wang in deciding whether to enter into the 2nd MOU.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">182. … I did not tell Sun or Wang the price I was purchasing the Angel Investors’ shares at. I knew that Sun was a tough negotiator. I did not want him to use my purchase price of SGD350 per share to try and bargain down his purchase price of SGD450 per share.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 This is a clear admission on Goh’s part that the amount the angel investors received for their shares was important to Wang. Wang’s decision to purchase the shares at S$450 per share was inextricably linked to her belief that the angel investors were receiving the same price from Goh for their shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 The fact that Wang might have received additional benefits under the 2nd MOU is irrelevant to the question of whether the AI share price representation played a real and substantial part in contributing to Wang’s entry into the 2nd MOU (see [55] above). While Wang might have extracted further concessions from Goh prior to entering the 2nd MOU, this does not mean that she did not rely on the AI share price representation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 Turning to [232(c)], I do not accept Goh’s submission that Wang and Sun would have known or suspected that the angel investors were selling their shares at less than S$450 per share. Goh admitted to keeping secret the fact that the angel investors were only receiving S$350 per share from Wang and Sun as they were likely to demand a lower price if they knew this. In the circumstances, the fact that Wang eventually agreed to the price of S$450 per share is strong evidence that she was induced by the AI share price representation. I also do not think that Wang obtaining extra concessions from Goh is inconsistent with her having been induced by the AI share price representation. It bears repeating that the AI share price representation need not be the sole cause of Wang’s entry into the 2nd MOU, and that a finding that it contributed to her actions is sufficient for a finding of inducement (see [55] and [216] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Whether the AI share price representation was made fraudulently</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 The AI share price representation was made fraudulently. Goh was aware by the time the 2nd MOU was signed that the angel investors were selling their shares to him at S$350 per share. He thus acted fraudulently in making the AI share price representation. Wang has thus made out her claim against Goh for fraudulent misrepresentation in respect of the AI share price representation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The second no further sale of shares representation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 Wang’s submission in relation to the second no further sale of shares representation was that Goh had impliedly represented that he had abided by his obligation in the 1st MOU (as amended) that he would not sell his shares in AMP without Wang’s permission prior to AMP’s IPO. This implied representation was made in the following manner:

I therefore disregard the aspect of Wang’s submission that relies on these WeChat messages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 Another difficulty with Wang’s claim is that with the exception of the representations constituted by Lin’s WeChat messages on 1 September 2014 (which were unpleaded), Wang could not point to any statements made by or on behalf of the defendants from which the second no further sale of shares representation could be implied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 It will be recalled that I found that the discounted share price representation, the no further sale of shares representation and the AI share price representation were made in part because Lin’s SD materially corroborated Wang and Sun’s evidence that those representations were made on specific occasions. However, no such evidence was forthcoming in relation to the alleged second no further sale of shares representation. While Wang and Sun deposed in their AEICs that they attended meetings with Goh and Lin (amongst others) in August 2014 and on 8 and 9 September 2014, they did not refer to any representations that were made during those meetings which related to Goh’s intention not to sell his AMP shares.
