The accused was spotted holding a white-coloured bundle in his left hand before entering his car at about 8.55 a.m. on 7 October 2010 by SSI Heng Chin Kok (“SSI Heng”). CNB officers tailed his car to the Mall, and his car was seen entering the entrance of the B4 carpark of the Mall. CCTV footage also showed his car entering the carpark and him taking the lift from B4 to the ground level of the Mall before walking towards the exit thereafter. The accused was seen leaving the Mall by SSI Heng and SSgt Ravichandran Ramu for the coffeeshop at Shing Hotel. After the accused’s arrest (after being seen passing Ahad a white envelope containing S$3,000), the accused’s car key was recovered during a search of the accused. The accused was brought to his car which was unlocked and searched in his presence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Under the directions of DSP Tan Seow Keong (“DSP Tan”), SSSgt Chan Kin Foong took photographs of the Mall, and of the car at the B4 carpark of the Mall in the presence of the accused. The contents of the ‘Choices’ plastic bag that was recovered from the floor mat of the front passenger seat were placed on a Ziploc bag on top of the car boot and counted in the presence of the accused. Several other items were seized from the car: a bottle of mineral water, two pairs of sunglasses, one piece of cloth, and one piece of rubber band. DNA analysis revealed that the DNA of the accused was found on the gear knob, steering wheel and handbrake of the car, on one of the sunglasses, on the bottle of mineral water and on the piece of cloth and rubber band. More importantly, the accused’s DNA was discovered on the interior and exterior of the ‘Choices’ plastic bag containing the drug exhibits. The Prosecution thus relied on the DNA evidence, testimonies of the CNB officers involved, a letter from the Land Transport Authority confirming the accused’s ownership of the car, as well as the presumption of possession under s 21 of the MDA, where any controlled drug found in any vehicle shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of the owner of the vehicle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Prosecution also submitted that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of controlled drugs in the ‘Choices’ plastic bag recovered from the vehicle. They relied on the following to indicate that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of controlled drugs found in the car:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the accused’s DNA was found on the interior and exterior of the ‘Choices’ plastic bag that contained the controlled drugs;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) pages of the newspaper used to wrap the drugs in the ‘Choices’ plastic bag were part of a same set of newspaper from which other pages were found in the luggage bag found in the accused’s Flat which contained more drug exhibits;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the plastic packets that were sealed and found in the ‘Choices’ plastic bag were heat-sealed using the same heat sealer as those that were sealed and found in the luggage bag in the Flat, and the accused’s DNA was found on that heat-sealer; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the accused was the registered owner of the car, and had admitted during cross-examination that he had parked and locked the car at the B4 carpark of the Mall that morning on 7 October 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Lastly, in support of the case that the accused had the 3.56 grams of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, the Prosecution relied on the presumption in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA and pointed me, in addition to the abovementioned facts in [14], to the fact that the luggage bag that was found in the Flat contained numerous drug paraphernalia used for trafficking of controlled drugs, such as the said heat-sealer, a knife, a brush, a pair of scissors and empty plastic sachets (see below at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The capital charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In respect of the capital charge, it was the Prosecution’s case that it had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had in his possession the 193 packets of controlled drugs recovered from the Flat, which were subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 34.94 grams of diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The accused did not deny ownership of the Flat, and also admitted that the Flat was unlocked in his presence by the CNB officers who also searched the Flat in his presence and that Rosli, who was found in the bathroom, was arrested then on 7 October 2010. The luggage bag that contained the drug exhibits was recovered from the bedroom of the Flat by W/SSgt Jenny, who asked the accused for the keys to the padlock of the main compartment of the luggage bag. The accused claimed that he did not have the keys, and said that the luggage bag belonged to his family maid, Meisaroh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Two weighing scales, some batteries, a lighter, a white candle, two chargers and one extension plug were recovered from the small front compartment of the luggage bag which was not locked. SSSgt Alwin used an operational cutter to cut the padlock of the main compartment of the luggage bag in the presence of the accused. Thereafter, W/SSgt Jenny searched the main compartment, saw a plastic bag containing brown granular substances and was told to wait for the arrival of the Forensic Management Branch officer by ASP Aaron Tang. The controlled drugs found in the luggage bag were revealed after analysis to have contained not less than 34.94 grams of diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The following drug paraphernalia were recovered from the luggage bag:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) one ‘BIG BOOKSHOP’ plastic bag containing white candles, brown envelopes, white envelopes, red rubber bands, disposal gloves, plastic bags and empty plastic sachets;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) one paper box containing one electronic heat-sealer, operating instructions, an adjusting tool, plastic bag, white strip and two Styrofoam boxes;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) one box of disposable vinyl exam gloves;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) one pink ‘BODY PALACE’ bag containing three packets of drugs, one metal spoon, a sheathed knife, a brush, a pair of scissors and empty plastic sachets;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) one stack of newspapers;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) an assortment of empty plastic bags; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) one black lighter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 A digital weighing scale was also recovered from beneath the kitchen sink of the Flat, as well as another ‘BIG BOOKSHOP’ plastic bag containing eight packets of white envelopes, one liquid corrector, one receipt, and another ‘RAW’ bag containing a yellow plastic sheet with numerous empty plastic sachets in it. A set of two keys for the padlock on the main compartment of the luggage bag was also found in a drawer in the wardrobe of the bedroom in the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The accused admitted to owning the digital weighing scale recovered from the kitchen, and also admitted that the controlled drugs and items mentioned above in [18] and [19] were found in the luggage bag by the CNB officers on the day of his arrest in the Flat. DNA of the accused was found on numerous items recovered from the luggage bag, including the plastic packets that contained the drugs. The Housing Development Board confirmed the accused as the registered sole lessee of the Flat, and the accused admitted he had resided in the bedroom where the luggage bag was recovered from. Rosli, who had stayed in the Flat for a period of time, also testified that the accused had used the bedroom when he was in Singapore. Records from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority revealed that the accused was in Singapore for the whole month of July (with the exception of 24 to 27 July 2010) until the date of his arrest on 7 October 2010.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Two other persons had regular access to the Flat: Rosli, as well as the accused’s family maid, Meisaroh. The Prosecution submitted that there was neither DNA nor other objective evidence to suggest that the luggage bag in the bedroom belonged to either of them. Rosli testified that he was absent from the Flat when he stayed in Studio M Hotel from 3 to 6 October 2010, and at a chalet on the night of 6 October 2010 just before the date of the arrest on 7 October 2010. This was corroborated by evidence from Studio M Hotel adduced by the Prosecution. Rosli also testified at trial that he did not give the keys to the Flat to anyone, and he denied ownership of the luggage bag and stated that he had not seen it before 7 October 2010. As for Meisaroh, she testified at trial that she had only gone to the Flat occasionally to deliver food to the accused or to tidy the Flat up, and had neither opened the cupboards in the Flat nor seen the luggage bag before. Thus, the Prosecution submitted that in light of the above, the accused who was the main occupant of the bedroom and Flat, had in his possession the controlled drugs found in the bedroom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 For the Prosecution’s case that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs found in the luggage bag, the Prosecution relied on the overwhelming DNA evidence. DNA of the accused was found on several items in the luggage bag, including the interior and exterior of plastic bags that contained controlled drugs, as well as the heat-sealer and the exterior of several drug paraphernalia. Hair of the accused was also found heat-sealed onto a particular plastic packet of drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Lastly, the Prosecution submitted that the drug paraphernalia seized from the luggage bag and the Flat (see above at [18]–[20]) was strong evidence that the accused possessed the controlled drugs found in the luggage bag for the purposes of trafficking. The presumption in s 17 of the MDA was also resorted to, as the amount of diamorphine analysed and found (not less than 34.94 grams of diamorphine) exceeded the required 2 grams of diamorphine in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA to trigger the presumption that the accused had possessed the controlled drugs for the purposes of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Accused’s credibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Prosecution also submitted that the accused had been repeatedly lying and giving false testimony to the court, and sought to establish that the following lies amounted to a corroboration of the accused’s guilt and lack of credibility:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused lied about the number of envelopes that he handed to Ahad on the day of his arrest;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The accused lied when he claimed that the sum of $3,000 that he handed to Ahad belonged to himself;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The accused lied about his movements on the day of his arrest;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The accused lied when he claimed that the luggage bag did not belong to him;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The accused lied when he claimed that the maid and his mother had found a discarded face mask in the Flat; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The accused lied and fabricated serious allegations against DSP Tan, alleging that DSP Tan had threatened the maid with bodily harm to ensure that she would not attend court to testify.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The accused’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In his defence during the trial, the accused flatly denied possession of the controlled drugs in both charges, and denied that he knew the nature of the controlled drugs or that he possessed them for the purposes of trafficking. Broadly, he claimed that (a) the controlled drugs were planted by someone in his car and in the Flat; (b) he was framed by CNB officers; (c) the Prosecution’s exhibits were forged; and (d) exhibits and photographs were tampered with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The accused also apparently believed that all these were part of a ploy and that there were “hidden messages” and a “hidden agenda” to “fix [him] up”

In his long statement dated 12 October 2010, the accused claimed that he suspected Hashim, someone he met the evening before the date of his arrest, on 6 October 2010, to have planted the controlled drugs in his car. On the fifth day of trial, he suspected that W/SSgt Jenny or her colleagues from CNB were the ones who planted the drugs in his car.

In a situation where an accused person lies deliberately in relation to a material issue, the lies may corroborate other existing evidence against the accused. The accused may have intentionally lied, not for innocent reasons, but because he knows that he would be linked to the crime if he is to tell the truth. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi</span> [2015] SGCA 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span>”) presented the requirements laid down by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Regina v Lucas (Ruth) </span>[1981] QB 720 at 724 (the “<span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>test”) as such:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The lie … is deliberate;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It relates to a material issue;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The statement must clearly be shown to be a lie by independent evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 These requirements were accepted and applied by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon Poh </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 302 at [33] and <span class="font-italic">Kamrul Hasan Abdul Quddus v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] SGCA 52 at [18], and recently endorsed again in <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span> at [60]. A lie (regardless whether told in or out of court) that satisfies the above four conditions can be referred to as a <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> lie. The <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>conditions apply whether or not corroboration is required or desirable for certain forms of evidence, e.g. identification evidence, evidence of an accomplice (which was the case in <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> itself). <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies may amount to corroboration in <span class="font-italic">all situations</span> as any other existing forms of evidence can always be strengthened by corroboration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The operation of the <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> conditions in situations where statutory presumptions are triggered is no different. <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies in such situations would amount to corroboration of any other evidence against the accused, although it may be the case that such corroboration may not be necessary to find certain facts in the first place, given the operation of statutory presumptions that may apply.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inconsistencies in the accused’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Reverting to the present case, the internal inconsistencies and vacillations in the accused’s evidence were numerous:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused alleged at different times of the trial, changing his tune, that different people had planted the drug exhibits in his car and Flat (see above [28]–[29]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The accused repeatedly denied on the second,

</div>
</div> In the light of this, and the fact that the accused’s allegations that he was framed by the authorities were unsupported and were instead refuted by other evidence, I found the accused’s “theories”, including his “Number Nine” theory (see above at [27]), incredible and unbelievable. The discrepancies in the accused’s testimony were of a “widespread pattern of many inconsistencies coming together” that destroyed his credibility altogether. His discrepancies were not “innocent” and must be distinguished from unintended mistakes in his recollection; the accused was short on the truth, and long on embellishment and in making spurious bare allegations. It was as if he cast a wide net of theories that allegedly explained everything away, only for him to catch nothing in the face of other evidence against him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The accused’s</span> Lucas<span class="font-italic"> lies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Out of the six lies raised by the Prosecution (see above at [25]) to have been told by the accused, I was of the view that the first and second lies were not <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> lies. The first lie regarding the exact number of envelopes the accused had handed to Ahad was inconsequential and not relating to a material issue. The second purported lie regarding the ownership of the sum of $3,000 in the envelope handed to Ahad was not strictly proved to be a lie by independent evidence. The Prosecution had instead invited the court to draw an adverse inference against the accused on this matter since the accused did not produce Ahad as his witness to testify that the said monies belonged to the accused.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 On the other hand, I found that the other four lies put forth by the Prosecution were deliberate, relating to material issues regarding either the accused’s case or the elements of the drug charges, and shown to be false by independent evidence. The accused’s movements on the day of his arrest were confirmed by the testimony of the tow truck driver (see above at [42(b)]); DNA evidence was found on the items recovered from the luggage bag in the Flat (see above at [42(c)]); the maid had testified that she did not find a discarded face mask in the Flat (see above at [42(d)]); and the maid also testified that she was never threatened by anyone with bodily harm before she left Singapore (see above at [42(e)]). I was of the view that these lies were deliberately told by the accused and motivated by the accused’s desire to distance himself from the drugs found and to establish his “theories” that he was framed. The lies were not made for innocent reasons. The accused’s endeavour to distance himself as far as possible from the drug exhibits indisputably found in his car and Flat was exaggerated to the extent they were shown to be incredible and to be lies. As the Court of Appeal put it in <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span> at [61], there was “no acceptable explanation for the lies save for his realisation of his guilt”. Thus, apart from the finding that the accused was not creditworthy, the accused’s <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> lies also amounted to corroboration of evidence of guilt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The elements of the drug trafficking charges were made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I found that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the elements of both charges were made out. The weight of the evidence led by the Prosecution was overwhelmingly against the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The accused had in his possession the diamorphine recovered from both his car and the Flat where he was the sole lessee and main occupant of the room where the drugs were recovered from. The DNA evidence in both instances clearly pointed to the accused’s possession of the drugs recovered. The accused’s DNA was found on the interior and exterior of the plastic bags containing the drug exhibits in the car and in the luggage bag in the Flat, as well as on several drug paraphernalia in the luggage bag. For the non-capital charge, the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of possession under s 21 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities, where any controlled drug found in any vehicle shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of the owner of the vehicle. The accused’s allegations that the drugs were planted in his vehicle (by various different people that he had accused at different points of the trial) and in his Flat were unfounded, and were a desperate attempt to distance himself from the drugs recovered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I also found that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs recovered with regard to both charges. For the non-capital charge, pages of the newspaper used to wrap the drugs in the ‘Choices’ plastic bag were part of a same newspaper as the other pages found in the luggage bag in the accused’s Flat which contained more drug exhibits. Further, the plastic packets that were sealed and found in the ‘Choices’ plastic bag were heat-sealed using the same heat sealer as those that were sealed and found in the luggage bag in the Flat, and the accused’s DNA was found on the said heat-sealer. As for the capital charge, the DNA of the accused found on the plastic bags containing the drugs and on the drug paraphernalia in the luggage bag established that the accused had actual knowledge of the nature of the controlled drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Lastly, the accused also failed to rebut the presumption in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA that he had possessed the controlled drugs for the purposes of trafficking with respect to both charges. From the drug paraphernalia found in the luggage bag that included, among others, the heat-sealer, empty plastic bags, empty plastic sachets, I found, even without resorting to the presumption in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA, that the accused had possessed the drugs for the purposes of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The accused’s defence rested on “theories” and spurious allegations that were unsupported by any convincing evidence. His <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies (see above at [41]–[45]) also amounted to corroboration of the already-strong evidence against him. In any event, I must also add that even if the accused had not told all the lies that he did, the scenario he painted as part of his defence was hard to believe and unsupported by any evidence and that I would have found that the elements of both charges were made out anyway.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentencing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 After I convicted the accused, the Prosecution confirmed that the Public Prosecutor would not issue a certificate under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA to certify that the accused had substantively assisted the CNB. The accused also did not claim that he was suffering from such abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired his mental responsibility at the time of the offence. The facts and evidence led showed that the accused was not a mere courier of drugs; he had the intention and means of repacking the drugs, as evinced from the extensive drug paraphernalia found in the luggage bag (see above at [19]). The accused thus did not come under ss 33B(2) or 33B(3) of the MDA, and I imposed the mandatory death penalty on the accused for the capital charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As for the non-capital charge which involved not less than 3.56 grams of diamorphine, I imposed an imprisonment term of six years, with effect from the date of his remand on 9 October 2010. I noted that s 322(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) provides that a death sentence must be carried out despite a pending sentence of imprisonment. I also noted that the starting point for first-time offenders (which is broadly proportional to the quantity of diamorphine) as laid down by Sundaresh Menon CJ in his framework for appropriate benchmark sentences for trafficking in diamorphine in <span class="font-italic">Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 5 SLR 122 at [47] was 6–7 years’ imprisonment for 3–5 grams of diamorphine trafficked. No caning was imposed as the accused was more than 50 years of age: s 325(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC. The sentence of six years is on the lenient side as I did not adjust the sentence upwards for the fact that the accused would not be liable for caning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I also ordered the exhibits to be disposed of after his appeal has been dealt with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The accused has appealed to the Court of Appeal against his conviction and sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohamed Faizal s/o Md Abdul Kadir, Shahla Iqbal, Wong Woon Kwong, N K Anitha and Shen Wanqin (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;<br/>Vinit Chhabra (Vinit Chhabra Partnership) (3 April–7 October 2013),  Lim Swee Tee (Lim Swee Tee &amp; Co) (3 April–7 October 2013) for the accused;<br/>Joseph Tan Chin Aik (Atkins Law Corporation) (12 December 2013–22 January 2014), Ramesh Chandr Tiwary (Ramesh Tiwary) (24 January 2014–5 October 2015) as McKenzie friend for the accused in person; <br/>The accused in person without any McKenzie friend after 5 October 2015.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
