Both defendants, ERC Holdings Pte Ltd (“ERCH”) and KPM Holdings Pte Ltd (“KPMH”), claim ownership of the shares, each using the narrative advanced by the other in previous litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 ERCH and KPMH are private investment companies. It is not disputed that an individual by the name of Andy Ong is the controlling mind of ERCH; another individual by the name of Douglas Foo is the controlling mind of KPMH; and that $1,000,000 was paid by KPMH on 23 November 2009 arising out of an arrangement between the two men. GRIEC is an investment holding company whose shareholders included Mr Ong and Mr Ho. KPMH relies upon prior evidence given by Mr Ong that, pursuant to an oral agreement with Mr Foo and upon the receipt of $1,000,000, ERCH set up a trust of the GREIC shares for KPMH’s benefit. KPMH now asks for the transfer of the shares, on the premise that there is either an express trust, a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust or a constructive trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 ERCH, on the other hand, relies upon the previous testimony of Mr Foo that the sum of $1,000,000 was advanced merely as a loan, contending that Mr Foo, while advancing this former narrative, had disclaimed his interest in the trust. ERCH contends that because the attempt to constitute an express trust failed, a resulting trust arises over the shares in favour of ERCH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The truth may be obscure but the known facts that are key to resolving the question of entitlement are largely not in dispute. It is common ground that interpleader relief should be granted and that I should summarily determine the issue between the two competing defendants. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The value of the one million GREIC shares (“the GREIC shares”) lies in their link to ownership in a commercial development named Bugis Cube, situated at 470 North Bridge Road, Singapore. GREIC and Sakae Holdings Ltd (“Sakae”), a public listed company of which Mr Foo is founder and chairman, set up Griffin Real Estate Investment Holdings (“GREIH”) as a joint venture company in late 2009 in order to acquire and develop Bugis Cube.

Pursuant to Mr Ong’s advice to limit Sakae’s risk exposure however, Sakae invested $4,000,000 instead. This meant that Mr Ong was still short of $1,000,000 in funds. Because they were close friends at the time who had known each other for more than 20 years, Mr Foo promised Mr Ong a loan of $1,000,000, to be used for the purposes of acquiring Bugis Cube. Unknown to him, his wife who is also a director at KPMH, issued the cheque to GREIH, rather than to Mr Ong, at Mr Ong’s instruction.

</div> In reliance on Mr Ong’s past statements that the money was used to set up a trust for the benefit of KPMH in respect of the 1,000,000 GREIC shares and share documents stating that Mr Ho held the shares as trustee, KPMH’s contention is that an express trust was created over the GREIC shares, and KPMH is the beneficiary of the trust. In the alternative, a resulting trust had arisen over the $1,000,000 from the misuse and unauthorised use of money that was loaned for a specific purpose. This kind of trust, termed in law as a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust, is explained more fully below. As a final alternative argument, KPMH argues that in the circumstances, even if Mr Foo’s expectation did not amount to a condition as required in a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust, a constructive trust had arisen over the $1,000,000 shares because Mr Ong was aware of Mr Foo’s expectation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Mr Ong’s explanation for the share documents, in  contrast, is that sometime in late 2009 or 2010, he reached an oral agreement with Mr Foo under which KPMH would purchase shares from ERCH to be held on trust by Mr Ho.

</div>
</div> Nevertheless, as Mr Foo had no intention to set up a trust, none was created. Further, the effect of Mr Foo’s evidence is that the money was loaned for no specific purpose, and Mr Foo’s only recourse would be to pursue the debt, which he has done in filing a proof of debt with the liquidators of GREIH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Initially, ERCH contended that KPMH sought double recovery, in that KPMH earlier sought the return of the $1,000,000 loan in GREIH’s liquidation. Mr Foo has since clarified that he would forego claims against the loan if the shares are returned to him. The issues, therefore, are the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether KPMH may claim the shares under an express trust. The two sub-issues presented by ERCH’s arguments are whether such a trust was created; and if so, whether KPMH has disclaimed its interest.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Alternatively, whether the $1,000,000 payment was for a specific purpose which was diverted, giving rise to a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust such that KPMH’s interest may be traced to the shares. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In any event, whether the circumstances were such that a constructive trust had arisen such that KPMH’s interest may be traced to the shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 For the reasons that follow, I hold that no express trust, <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust or constructive trust is applicable on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The express trust arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was an express trust created?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 It is not disputed that a trust may be created once three certainties are fulfilled: that of subject matter, object and the settlor’s intention. Only the last mentioned is disputed. KPMH contends that ERCH was the settlor and KPMH was only a beneficiary. Hence, the fact that a representative from KPMH did not sign the Trust Deed was immaterial as the trust was fully constituted without the signature of the intended beneficiary. ERCH, on the other hand, contends that there was no express declaration of trust. The oral arrangement between Mr Foo and Mr Ong assumed that Mr Foo was the settlor. ERCH argues that, in the light of his prior evidence, Mr Foo plainly had no intention to set up the trust, the trust failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Court of Appeal considered the issue of certainty of intention in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span>”). In that case, a partnership that operated a restaurant in Bali was disputing the beneficial ownership of certain “Ku De Ta” marks (“contested marks”) that were registered in Singapore by a company called Nine Squares. One issue was whether Nine Squares held the contested marks on express trust for the partnership (see <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span> at [49]). The key dispute under this issue was whether Nine Squares intended to hold the contested marks and the benefits derived therefrom on trust for the partnership, hence demonstrating sufficient certainty of intention (see <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span>at [61]). The Court of Appeal made clear that certainty of intention requires proof that a trust was intended by the settlor. However, no particular form of expression is necessary to prove an intention to create a trust (see <span class="font-italic">Guy Neal</span><span class="font-italic">e</span> at [52]). Such an intention may be inferred from the alleged settlor’s words and conduct, as well as from the surrounding circumstances (see <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span> at [58]). The court inferred that there was an intention on the part of Nine Squares to hold the contested marks on trust for the partnership. I highlight two strands of evidence which the Court of Appeal relied on in coming to their decision. First, the representatives of Nine Square seemed to acquiesce or at least not object to the position taken in emails from the founders of the partnership that “Ku De Ta” marks registered outside of Indonesia, including the contested marks, were being held for the benefit of the partnership as a whole (see <span class="font-italic">Guy Neal</span><span class="font-italic">e</span> at [90]). Second, the affidavit of a representative of Nine Square and Nine Square’s defence filed in Australian proceedings expressly stated that the contested marks were being held on trust for the partnership as a whole (see <span class="font-italic">Guy Neal</span><span class="font-italic">e</span> at [100] and [115]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 From the decision in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span> it is clear that in the search for an intention to create a trust, the relevant intention is that of the settlor and such intention may be inferred from the words and conduct of the settlor. Another point from that case that is pertinent to the present one is that the admissions and statements made in prior legal proceedings may be relevant in discerning the intention of the settlor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In the present case, I accept KPMH’s position that ERCH was the settlor of the alleged trust. It is not disputed that the money was first advanced by KPMH on 23 November 2009 to the account of GREIH at Mr Ong’s request.

</div> It was then entered on the general ledger of GREIH as a loan from ERCH on 24 November 2009. The shares in dispute were initially in the name of ERCH. ERCH then procured the transfer of the shares to Mr Ho, the trustee, and thereby constituted the trust (see [6] above). In <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span>, Nine Squares, as the registered proprietor of the disputed marks, was the settlor. Similarly, as the original legal owner of the disputed GREIC shares, ERCH must be the settlor of any alleged trust over the same shares. In contrast, at no point was Mr Foo the legal owner of the disputed GREIC shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 ERCH’s contention that KPMH is the settlor is premised on Mr Ong’s prior evidence that parties agreed that KPMH would purchase the disputed GREIC shares and Mr Ho would hold the shares on trust for KPMH, with the trust being formalised by way of a Trust Deed signed by Mr Ho and KPMH.

</div>
</div> A distinction, however, must be drawn between a contractual analysis of the parties’ relationship, and the analysis with respect to the creation of the express trust. While the former looks at the terms the parties had agreed on and whether there was a breach of such terms, the latter is concerned with whether a settlor manifested an intention to create a trust with certainty of subject and object. Even if there was some contractual agreement for a trust to be set up in a particular manner, the manner in which the trust is set up is a different issue. Based on the undisputed evidence, ERCH, as the legal owner of the shares, had taken a certain course of conduct and made Mr Ho trustee over the shares for the benefit of KPMH. The proper question is therefore whether ERCH had manifested an intention to create a trust over the disputed GREIC shares in favour of KPMH, regardless of any agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I find that ERCH did manifest such an intention, as evidenced by its conduct and the various statements that were made by Mr Ho and Mr Ong in prior lawsuits. Mr Ho in his Defence for Suit 1098/2013 filed on 21 July 2015 stated that he was “approached by Mr Andy Ong” to hold the shares for Mr Foo or his nominee.

This was a case involving a settlor, Mr Strauss, and a beneficiary, Lady Nass. Mr Strauss had executed a settlement deed in favour of Lady Nass that was signed, sealed and unconditionally delivered (see <span class="font-italic">Lady Nass</span> at 381–382). The executed settlement deed was sent to Lady Nass. Sir George Lewis, the solicitor who acted on behalf of Mr Strauss, wrote to Sir John Withers, the solicitor who acted on behalf of Lady Nass, and gave the impression that Mr Strauss had offered to make a settlement, but the offer had been revoked. Sir George Lewis requested that the settlement deed be returned to Mr Strauss. The fact that the settlement deed was signed, sealed and unconditionally delivered was not highlighted by Sir George Lewis (see <span class="font-italic">Lady Nass </span>at 392–394). Sir John Withers was thus under the impression that the settlement was somehow incomplete and of no binding effect, and thus advised Lady Nass to return the settlement deed. Lady Nass eventually complied (see <span class="font-italic">Lady Nass </span>at 394–396). The House of Lords held that Mr Strauss, by signing, sealing and unconditionally delivering the settlement deed, was bound by it. The question was whether Lady Nass’s actions after the settlement deed was delivered to her amounted to a disclaimer of the settlement (see <span class="font-italic">Lady Nass</span> at 390–391).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Lord Russell of Killowen explained at 396-7: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my opinion disclaimer can only be made with knowledge of the interest alleged to be disclaimed, and with an intention to disclaim it. So far as her legal advisers were concerned they were misled by the statements insisted upon by Sir George Lewis. They had not, and could not have, any knowledge of the unconditional delivery of the deed, and must have believed that in the circumstances the deed was inoperative, and that the whole matter was capable of revocation and had been effectively revoked, with the result that there could be no interests to disclaim. In this they were misinformed and mistaken; but their mistake cannot affect the rights of the beneficiaries under the deed. As regards the first appellant herself, so far from finding any intention on her part to give up her rights under the deed, the evidence points the other way. She had settled her difficulty with the settlor by the end of 1925, and ever since then was prepared to execute the document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 KPMH’s argument rests on <span class="font-italic">Lady Naas</span>. It is that Mr Foo’s prior evidence does not amount to a disclaimer, because those reflect Mr Foo’s views in the light of the legal advice he was given at the time. He was, in any event, represented by a different set of solicitors, and his knowledge and belief rested on their advice. The present solicitors argue that only after the final conclusion of Suit 1098/2013 in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae</span> <span class="font-italic">CA</span> was Mr Foo able to focus on the shares and his entitlement in them. Because he had no knowledge, he also did not possess the intention to unequivocally reject his entitlement under the trust. Once he had been duly educated by his present set of solicitors, he realised that the trust property was his. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 ERCH relies upon the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Paradise Motor Co Ltd</span> [1968] 1 WLR 1125 (“<span class="font-italic">Paradise Motor</span>”). This was a case involving a man named Mr Watson and another man named Mr Johns, who was Mr Watson’s stepson. Mr Watson executed a transfer of 350 shares in Paradise Motor Co Ltd to Mr Johns. The transfer was defective, but Mr Watson had done everything which was needed to complete the gift of the shares, and hence Mr Johns was the equitable owner of the shares by virtue of the principle in <span class="font-italic">In re Rose</span><span class="font-italic">, Rose</span> <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">another</span> <span class="font-italic">v Inland Revenue Commissioners</span> [1952] Ch 499 (“<span class="font-italic">re Rose</span>”) (see <span class="font-italic">Paradise Motor</span> at 1140–1141). The issue before the court was whether Mr Johns had disclaimed Mr Watson’s gift. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The English Court of Appeal held that Mr Johns had sufficient knowledge of the possible claim, and had disclaimed Mr Watson’s gift. The court was satisfied that Mr Johns had disclaimed the gift based essentially on two incidents. The first was upon receipt of the second of two liquidators’ letters sent to Mr Johns. The liquidator included brief facts pertaining to the liquidation of Paradise Motor Co Ltd and informed Mr Johns that his name was on the share register. This incident was, on Mr Johns’s evidence, the first time he came to know that he had a claim to certain shares. He answered “no” to each of the four questions in the liquidator’s letter, which included a query as to whether he claimed to be a shareholder of the company (see <span class="font-italic">Paradise Motor</span> at 1141C–G). The second incident concerned a message he sent to Mr Watson through a half- brother, Ronald, to the effect that he had no shares and he wanted no shares from Mr Watson. This was done in the context of a request by Mr Watson for Mr Johns to sign a transfer of 50 shares back to Mr Watson (see <span class="font-italic">Paradise Motor</span> at 1141–1142). Dankwerts LJ disagreed with Pennycuick J’s assessment in the court below in the following terms at 1142C-E:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pennycuick J. was unable to find a disclaimer either in the answer to the letter or in the message to Watson via Ronald. In the case of the message, he doubted whether Ronald could properly be treated as having given the message to Watson on behalf of Johns, but the evidence appears to us to be quite clear on that point. In the case of both, he considered that, for a disclaimer of a gift to be effective as such, the donee must possess reasonably full information as to the nature and amount of the gift. We do not think, with respect, that that generalisation is of universal application, and we do not think that it applies here. The message to Watson was quite plainly couched in language which showed that he was in no circumstances accepting entitlement to any shares.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That that was then his attitude is made the more likely by the fact that, in his evidence (when he knew for certain the value of the subject-matter), he asserted that he did not want any of the money for himself if he won, but would give it to charity, to someone who needed it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 <span class="font-italic">Lady Nass</span> was referred to and distinguished at 1142H as a case in which the person alleged to have disclaimed had been led to believe that she had no interest to disclaim, in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[<span class="font-italic">Lady Nass</span>] was a case in which the person allegedly disclaiming had been led to believe that she had no interest to disclaim; that the deed was no deed. Here, as we have said, there was sufficient knowledge of the nature of the possible claim ...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The two cases do not contradict each other, nor do they raise unconventional propositions of law. These propositions of law may be summarised as follows. A beneficiary may only renounce his interest if he is in possession of the full facts and circumstances of his actions. Nevertheless, once the beneficiary has sufficient knowledge of the relevant facts, his statements stating that he has no interest would be sufficient to effect a disclaimer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 By Mr Foo’s account, he had loaned Mr Ong $1,000,000 in 2009 for the acquisition of Bugis Cube. He did not query how the acquisition was made. Subsequently, he was informed as early as 4 March 2010 by his CFO at Sakae, that his name was on a list of shareholders of GREIC as the owner of 1 million shares (see [30] above). This was a serious context, and not a light-hearted one: he was legally obliged to disclose personal interests if he had any. The CFO’s email to him stated clearly that she wanted to “caution [Mr Foo] first” as she did not “feel good about this deal”.

Nor does KPMH’s contention at the hearing that Mr Foo was simply focused on Sakae’s business during the various lawsuits help him: the argument glosses over the fact that Sakae’s business required him to investigate and to declare his shareholding if any. The responsibility was his to verify the facts and make appropriate disclosure. Adopting a stance that amounted to wilful blindness towards the trust arrangement, he confirmed that he had no shares. In my view, a fair assessment is that KPMH, through Mr Foo, has disclaimed its interest in the GREIC shares. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Quistclose</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> trust</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust takes its name from the House of Lords case of <span class="font-italic">Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd</span> [1970] 1 AC 567 (“<span class="font-italic">Quistclose Investments</span>”). In that case, a company, Rolls Razor Ltd, was indebted to Barclays Bank, and was in need of a sum of money to pay dividends which had been declared on its shares. Rolls Razor Ltd borrowed money from a company by the name of Quistclose Investments Ltd. At a board meeting of Quistclose Investments Ltd, a resolution was passed that stated that the loan was to be made “for the purpose of [Rolls Razor Ltd] paying the final dividend due on July 24”. Quistclose Investments Ltd drew a cheque in favour of Rolls Razor Ltd, and sent the cheque to Barclays Bank. A representative from Quistclose Investments Ltd called Barclays Bank to confirm that the money would “only be used to meet the dividend due on July 24, 1964”. This confirmation was repeated in the covering letter enclosed with the cheque. On Quistclose Investments Ltd’s instructions, the money was paid into a separate account at Barclays Bank. Before the dividend was paid, Rolls Razor Ltd went into liquidation. The question before the House of Lords was whether Rolls Razor Ltd held the money on trust for Quistclose Investments Ltd (see <span class="font-italic">Quistclose Investments</span> at 578–579). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Lord Wilberforce, with whom the rest of the court agreed, held that a trust had arisen over the money. He explained at 581–582:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]hen the money is advanced, the lender acquires an equitable right to see that it is applied for the primary designated purpose … when the purpose has been carried out ... the lender has his remedy against the borrower in debt: if the primary purpose cannot be carried out, the question arises if a secondary purpose (i.e., repayment to the lender) has been agreed, expressly or by implication: if it has, the remedies of equity may be invoked to give effect to it, if it has not (and the money is intended to fall within the general fund of the debtor’s assets) then there is the appropriate remedy for recovery of a loan. … In the present case the intention to create a secondary trust for the benefit of the lender, to arise if the primary trust, to pay the dividend, could not be carried out, is clear and I can find no reason why the law should not give effect to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Lord Wilberforce’s analysis envisages two successive trusts arising in a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust situation. The first is a primary purpose trust and the second is a secondary trust that arises in favour of the lender if the primary purpose is not carried out. The two successive trusts analysis was reviewed in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley and </span><span class="font-italic">others</span> [2002] 2 AC 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> was a case that involved a lender that was only prepared to grant a loan if the borrower secured repayment by a solicitor’s personal undertaking. Such an undertaking was eventually provided to the lender’s satisfaction (see <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at [54]–[58]). The undertaking provided, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.

Lord Millet at [73]–[74] was careful to highlight that the mere fact that money is paid for a particular purpose is insufficient to constitute a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73 A Quistclose<span class="font-italic"> </span>trust does not necessarily arise merely because money is paid for a particular purpose.

Instead, at [100] he characterised the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust as a resulting trust:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">100 … the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust [is] an entirely orthodox example of the kind of default trust known as a resulting trust. The lender pays the money to the borrower by way of loan, but he does not part with the entire beneficial interest in the money, and in so far as he does not it is held on a resulting trust for the lender from the outset … it is the borrower who has a very limited use of the money, being obliged to apply it for the stated purpose or return it. He has no beneficial interest in the money, which remains throughout in the lender subject only to the borrower’s power or duty to apply the money in accordance with the lender’s instructions. When the purpose fails, the money is returnable to the lender, not under some new trust in his favour which only comes into being on the failure of the purpose, but because the resulting trust in his favour is no longer subject to any power on the part of the borrower to make use of the money. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Lord Millet thus held at [75] and [103] that a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust had arisen in favour of the lender in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75 In the present case paragraphs 1 and 2 of the undertaking are crystal clear.

The money belonged throughout to [the lender], subject only to [the borrower’s] right to apply it for the acquisition of property …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Lord Millet’s explanation for the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust remains the dominant model in England (see <span class="font-italic">Challinor v Juliet Bellis &amp; Co </span>[2013] EWHC 347 (Ch) at [543]; <span class="font-italic">Raymond</span> <span class="font-italic">Bieber</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Teathers Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2012] EWCA Civ 1466 at [14]-[15]). This model was also recently endorsed by Quentin Loh J in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General</span> <span class="font-italic">v Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council</span> [2015] 4 SLR 474 (“<span class="font-italic">AG v AHPETC</span>”) at [108]–[110] as the model that should be adopted in Singapore. In that decision, Loh J made several other important observations, two of which I highlight here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 First, there is nothing in principle preventing the constitution of an express trust that operates in the same manner as a resulting <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust (see <span class="font-italic">AG v AHPETC</span> at [111]). While a resulting <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust corresponds to the lack of intention to benefit the recipient of the money, an express <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust arises out of an intention by the donor<span class="font-italic"> </span>to constitute the recipient as a trustee, and confer a power or duty on the recipient-trustee to apply the money exclusively in accordance with the stated purpose. Regardless of whether a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust is in the nature of an express or resulting trust, a crucial element of any <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust is the fact that the lender intends for the loan money to be used for a specified purpose (see <span class="font-italic">AG v AHPETC</span> at [114]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Second, the relevant intention is that of the lender of the money and does not depend on the bilateral intentions of the lender and the borrower. This is the natural corollary of the distinction between a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust on the one hand, and a contractual agreement to use the money in a certain manner on the other. The former is based on either the lender’s intention to constitute a trust, or a lack of intention to benefit the borrower. The latter is based on the objectively ascertained intentions of the parties to the agreement (see <span class="font-italic">AG v AHPETC</span> at [112]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was a </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Quistclose</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> trust created?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The need for a specified purpose is not a low threshold to cross. The settlor’s very specific intention is that which causes the beneficial interest to remain with him. The mere fact that a lender inquires about the purpose of a loan is insufficient. In each case, the question is “whether the parties intended the money to be at the free disposal of the recipient” (<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at [74]). In <span class="font-italic">Quistclose Investments</span>, this intention was demonstrated by the board resolution, the covering letter and the instructions given by Quistclose Investments Ltd to the bank (see [40] above). In <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span>, the solicitor’s undertaking sought by the lender was clearly phrased to restrict the use of the money to the sole specified purpose and no other (see [46] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my view, the present case does not reveal the specific intention required for a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust. Aside from Mr Foo’s bare assertion, he proffers no evidence that he expressed any intention to Mr Ong that the loan be used for the acquisition of Bugis Cube. The documentation for the loan, which during his cross-examination in 2016 he contended was verified with his wife (see [38] above), was not adduced. The facts indicate that Mr Foo had no intention to retain the beneficial interest. The evidence, rather, shows that the money was at the absolute and free disposal of Mr Ong. No attempt was made by Mr Foo to restrict GREIH’s use of the $1,000,000. Nor was any query posed to Mr Ong as to whether a specific purpose had been fulfilled, as highlighted at [38]–[39] above. Indeed during Mr Foo’s cross-examination, his position was that the loan was one on which there were no terms:

Mr Foo had no serious desire to restrict GREIH’s use of the loan moneys. In fact, it was inconvenient for him to know and he did not care to know what had happened to the $1,000,000. He was informed that KPMH possibly owned GREIC shares in 2010, by his CFO. In 2013 Mr Ong gave the specific details of what had happened to the $1,000,000 in the course of OS 124/2013. Again, the same details were given by Mr Ong and Mr Ho in their affidavits and pleadings filed for Suit 1098/2013. In that context, Mr Foo adopted the stance that he had no shares during his cross-examination in 2016. When asked whether he had checked to see whether the loan of S$1,000,000 was reflected in GREIH’s books or whether he had asked for repayment of the loan, Mr Foo’s answer was that he did not do either of those things.

</div>
</div> After the trial of Suit 1098/2013, KPMH then followed up to file a proof of debt in GREIH’s liquidation. In this regard, the liquidator’s recent information that the loan was entered in GREIH’s general ledger as a loan from ERCH supports, somewhat ironically, Mr Foo’s former evidence that the $1,000,000 was intended by him as a personal loan to Mr Ong and nothing more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This finding is sufficient to dispose of the arguments on the purported existence of a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust. Three other arguments were advanced by ERCH in the course of the hearing. These apply only on the premise of a <span class="font-italic">Qui</span><span class="font-italic">stclose</span> trust. I deal with them below for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Has its purpose been fulfilled?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 First, ERCH contends that in the event that the $1,000,000 was advanced with a specific purpose, the money was not misappropriated but used to fulfil its purpose. Mr Foo’s contention was that the loan was to enable Mr Ong to complete the acquisition of Bugis Cube. This was effected through the purchase of GREIC shares, which was a joint venture partner in GREIH, the company which acquired Bugis Cube. The purpose had been fulfilled, albeit through indirect means. Hence, Mr Foo’s recourse is to seek the return of his loan. Counsel for KPMH’s rejoinder is that notwithstanding this, the money can still be traced into the asset purchased, the GREIC shares. This link was not clearly established at the hearing before me, and on reflection, is not self-evident. The authorities are in agreement, on the contrary, that the effect of a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust upon the fulfilment of the specified purpose is that the lender would only have a claim in debt. This is made clear in the passage in <span class="font-italic">Quistclose Investments</span> cited above at [41], where Lord Wilberforce states that “when the purpose has been carried out … the lender has his remedy against the borrower in debt”. Similarly in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at [69], Lord Millet explains:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69 …When the money is advanced, the lender acquires a right, enforceable in equity, to see that it is applied for the stated purpose, or more accurately to prevent its application for any other purpose. This prevents the borrower from obtaining any beneficial interest in the money, at least while the designated purpose is still capable of being carried out. <span class="font-italic">Once the purpose has been carried out,</span> <span class="font-italic">the lender has his normal remedy in debt</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Has it been disclaimed?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, ERCH suggests that, in the event that a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust had arisen, it had been disclaimed by KPMH, in the same way that the express trust has been disclaimed. I add that this argument is only significant if I come to the opposite conclusion on the two previous issues, that there is in fact a loan on a specific trust, and that its purpose has not been fulfilled by the investment in GREIC shares. KPMH insists that trusts that arise by operation of law cannot be disclaimed and cites <span class="font-italic">Rajabali Jumabhoy and others v Ameerali R Jumabhoy and others </span>[1997] 2 SLR (R) 296 in support of its position. The context of that case, however, was that of an express trust, and nothing was said in relation to the issue of whether trusts that arise by operation of law could be disclaimed. I note, moreover, that the case of <span class="font-italic">Paradise Motor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(which the parties relies on for the point on disclaimer of an express trust) implicitly suggests that trusts that arise by operation of law can be disclaimed. This is because while Mr Johns’s name was on the share register of Paradise Motor Co Ltd, the transfer of the shares was procedurally defective, and Mr Johns was only the equitable owner of the shares by virtue of the principle in <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Rose </span>(see [34] above). This meant that a constructive trust had arisen over the shares in favour of Mr Johns. Yet, the English Court of Appeal allowed the argument on disclaimer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my judgment, I see no reason why a trust which arises by operation of law may not be disclaimed. KPMH’s assumption rests on the fact that trusts that arise by operation of law are not understood by their beneficiaries at the time of disclaimer to be trusts. As a matter of logic, and applying <span class="font-italic">Paradise Motor</span>, such a disclaimer may be made so long as the beneficiary is aware of the facts that give rise to the trust and, being sufficiently informed, renounces any beneficial interest in it. In this particular case, however, this possibility does not arise because the very factual circumstances that give rise to the disclaimer of the express trust obviates, entirely, consideration of a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust. Mr Foo’s protestations that are relevant to the issue of disclaimer support the conclusion that he did not intend to restrict the use of the $1,000,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does limitation bar any claim?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 A final point is whether, even if a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust is established, any relief would be time-barred under s 22(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“Limitation Act”). The relevant portion of s 22 of the Limitation Act reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Limitation of actions in respect of trust property</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span>—(1) No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a beneficiary under a trust, being an action —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the trustee was a party or privy; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted to his use.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to subsection (1), an action by a beneficiary to recover trust property or in respect of any breach of trust, not being an action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by any other provision of this Act, shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the right of action accrued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Mr Ho is not the trustee, and hence the action to compel Mr Ho to transfer the shares to KPMH is not an action to “recover from the trustee” and thus falls outside of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and falls within s 22(2) of the Limitation Act. ERCH argues that more than 6 years have passed since the right accrued.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 KPMH attempts two arguments to assert that s 22(2) does not apply, which I do not, upon consideration, find convincing. First, that <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd and another </span>[2013] 1 SLR 173 establishes that Class 1 constructive trusts fall under s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and have no limitation period. The authority is not apposite. Constructive trusts are not in issue; a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust is a resulting trust. The trustee in the purported <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust alternative relevant to s 22(1)(b) of the Limitation Act, moreover, is ERCH and not Mr Ho, from whom return is sought, bringing the action within subsection (2) rather than subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The second argument is that the limitation period should run only from the time of discovery, on the basis of s 29 of the Limitation Act. That section, however, requires fraud or mistake and none is alleged here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Parties did not argue this limitation point fully. In the light of my finding on the three bases above that dispose of the issue, I would only highlight that ERCH’s reliance on s 22 of the Limitation Act is consistent with the approach of Vinodh Coomaraswamy J to treat resulting trusts as trusts to which section 22 of the Limitation Act is applicable, in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon and others v Tan Choo Suan (in her personal capacity and as executrix of the estate of Tan Kiam Toen, deceased) and others and other matters</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1150 at [247]–[251].

Due to human error, money was paid into PES’s account instead of the account of another similarly named company. The parties in effective control of PES were informed that the moneys were paid by mistake. The money was kept in a separate account and was identifiable from the rest of the funds of PES (see <span class="font-italic">Pinkroccade</span> at [2]–[4]). Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) highlighted that (a) the money was paid under a mistake, (b) the persons in control of PES had knowledge that the moneys were paid by mistake and (c) the moneys were an identifiable fund in a separate account that was not mixed with the other funds of the company. In the circumstances, Lee JC held that a constructive trust had arisen the moment PES was made aware of the mistaken payment as it became unconscionable for PES to retain the moneys (see <span class="font-italic">Pinkroccade</span> at [21]–[22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The present case is distinguishable from the facts of <span class="font-italic">Pinkroccade</span>. There is no mistaken payment to speak of. Mr Foo’s evidence was that the money was promised to Mr Ong as a loan. No complaint is made of the fact that Mrs Foo made out the cheque for the loan as a director of KPMH to GREIH, at Mr Ong’s instruction. The loan, paid to the correct party, is recorded on the general ledger of GREIH as a loan, albeit from ERCH instead of KPMH (see [6] and [10] above). Without a mistaken payment, a constructive trust of a similar nature to that of <span class="font-italic">Pinkroccade</span> cannot arise.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In summary, I hold that ERCH, as the settlor, transferred the shares to Mr Ho to hold on trust for KPMH. KPMH, however, through various statements made by Mr Foo, has disclaimed any interest in the trust. The same protestations also rule out a finding of a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust. As there is a lack of intention to benefit Mr Ho, the GREIC shares are held on resulting trust in favour of ERCH (see <span class="font-italic">In re Vandervell’s Trusts (No 2)</span> [1974] 1 Ch 269 at 294G). ERCH is entitled to the return of the shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I shall hear counsel on costs and any consequential orders required. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Samuel Chacko, Lim Shack Keong, Anne-Marie John and Too Fang Yi (Legis Point LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Vikram Nair and Foo Xian Fong (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the first defendant;<br/>Koh Swee Yen, Ong Pei Chin, Margaret Huang and Nicholas Liu (WongPartnership LLP) for the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
