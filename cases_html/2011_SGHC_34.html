<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These grounds of decision arise from four
                    appeals which were consolidated for hearing. The four appellants are Bangladeshi
                    nationals. In the district court, each of them faced two related charges. The
                    first charge was under s 128I(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed) (“Customs Act”), read
                    with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal
                    Code”) and punishable under s 128L(4) of the Customs Act. The second
                    charge was under the ss 26 and 77 of the Goods and Services Tax Act
                    (Cap 117A, 2005 Rev Ed) (“Goods and Services Tax Act”),
                    read with the relevant subsidiary legislation. Both charges related to one
                    incident of retrieving and packing cigarettes which were
                uncustomed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The prosecution in the district court was
                    conducted by a senior superintendent of Singapore Customs. The appellants
                    pleaded guilty to the Customs Act charge on the basis of the following joint
                    statement of facts prepared by an officer from the Special Investigations Branch
                    of Singapore Customs. It reads in full as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The accused are B1) Md Bodiuzzaman Palash Md Saydul Huge [sic], male
                        Bangladeshi, aged 26yrs, Fin No: [XXX], DOB: 07/06/1984,</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    On 6 August 2010 at about 9.20pm, the accused
                            B1, B2, B3 and B4 were arrested at the vicinity of No. 8 Defu Lane
                            1, Singapore, for being concerned in dealing with uncustomed goods
                            (cigarettes) with common intention.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    On 6 August 2010 from 6.00pm onwards, customs
                            officers kept observation at the vicinity of No. 8 Defu Lane 1,
                            Singapore to look out for contraband cigarettes smuggling
                            activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    On 6 August 2010 at about 9.20pm, officers
                            sighted the accused B1, B2, B3 and B4 inside the unit of No. 8 Defu
                            Lane 1. The accused persons were seen to be retrieving cartons of
                            cigarettes hidden inside a pallet of rubber sheets, which was placed
                            inside the unit. There were also another 5 pallets of rubber sheets
                            placed outside the unit. Suspecting that the cigarettes which the four
                            accused were retrieving from the pallet of rubber sheets inside the unit
                            to be duty unpaid cigarettes, officers entered the unit and declared
                            office. During the check in the presence of the accused, a total of 3549
                            cartons x 200 sticks of Texas 5 brand duty unpaid cigarettes were found
                            in two pallets of rubber sheets outside the unit, 1 pallet of rubber
                            sheet inside the unit, and inside packed boxes inside the unit. All the
                            accused were placed under arrest. The cigarettes and 6 pallets of rubber
                            sheet were seized.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    Investigations revealed that all the accused would
                            be paid $30 - $40 by a male Chinese named Tang Mui Teck (Dealt with
                            separately) to retrieve and pack the cigarettes into boxes from the 6
                            pallets of rubber sheets.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The district judge recorded their pleas and convicted them
                    accordingly. The charge under the Goods and Services Tax Act was taken into
                    consideration for the purposes of sentencing. After considering their pleas of
                    mitigation, the district judge sentenced each of the appellants to 24
                    months’ imprisonment: see his grounds of decision in <em>Public Prosecutor v Biplob Hossain Younus Akan and ors</em>
                    [2010] SGDC 396.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The course of the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The case initially came before me as only
                    appeals against sentence by the four appellants. However, when I first reviewed
                    the appellants’ joint statement of facts (set out above) for the purpose
                    of the appeals against sentence, I was concerned that there appeared to be
                    nothing in it to show that the appellants had the requisite <em>mens rea</em> at the material time for the Customs Act charge to
                    which they had pleaded guilty. During the appeal, I was further troubled to hear
                    the appellants claim, rather animatedly, that they were unaware that they were
                    dealing with uncustomed cigarettes at the time of the offence. This undoubtedly
                    qualified their pleas of guilt. I conveyed to the deputy public prosecutor,
                    Ms Kan Shuk Weng (“Ms Kan”), my concerns about the
                    sufficiency of the statement of facts. For good measure, I also directed
                    Ms Kan to produce evidence showing how the appellants came to know that
                    they were dealing with uncustomed cigarettes. As pointed out in <em>Yunani bin Abdul Hamid v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR(R) 383 (“<em>Yunani”</em>) at
                    [56], if the evidence before a reviewing court raised serious doubts as to the
                    guilt of an accused person who had pleaded guilty, this would warrant the
                    exercise of the court’s revisionary powers in setting aside the plea of
                    guilt. The appeal was adjourned for a week so that Ms Kan could attend to
                    my queries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Ms Kan duly filed a criminal motion to
                    adduce several affidavits. The relevant affidavits were from (a) the
                    customs officers who interviewed the appellants, and who deposed that the
                    appellants gave affirmative answers when asked if they knew that the cigarettes
                    were uncustomed; (b) the interpreter assisting the customs officers, who
                    deposed that she translated their questions accurately; and (c) the
                    interpreter assisting the district court, who deposed that she did not pressure
                    the appellants to plead guilty. I noted that the contents of these affidavits
                    did not directly address my concern that the appellants only appeared to have
                    learnt that they were handling uncustomed cigarettes after they were
                    apprehended. Ms Kan candidly accepted this void in the Prosecution’s
                    case when I raised this with her. Ms Kan also informed me that the
                    principal offenders in the incident, one Tang Mui Teck (who recruited the
                    appellants to pack the uncustomed cigarettes) and one Voon Qing Lai, had
                    confirmed in further statements <em>that they did not inform the
                        appellants that the cigarettes were uncustomed</em>. While these
                    statements were not produced, this additional information fortified my concerns
                    about the Prosecution’s original assertion in relation to the
                    appellants’ requisite <em>mens
                rea</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Ms Kan also addressed me on the sufficiency
                    of the appellants’ statement of facts. After hearing Ms Kan, I was
                    satisfied that the appellants’ statement of facts, and their pleas of
                    guilt founded thereon, was deficient at law. I therefore exercised my powers of
                    revision to set aside their convictions and sentences and remitted the matter
                    back to the district court for fresh pleas to be taken. I now give the reasons
                    for my decision, together with some observations on matters that require further
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The statement of facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Under s 180(<em>b</em>) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed),
                    the only duty laid upon a magistrate’s court or a district court before
                    whom a plea of guilt is made is to ascertain that the accused person understands
                    the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit without
                    qualification the offence alleged against him. However, as
                    L P Thean J observed in <em>Chota bin Abdul Razak
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 501 at [11], a
                    practice had developed in which, before a plea of guilt by the accused is
                    accepted by the court, a statement of facts setting out the circumstances in
                    which the offence is alleged to have been committed is read to the accused by
                    the Prosecution and the accused is required to admit such statement. In
                    Thean J’s view, the statement of facts enables a court to fulfil its
                    duty under s 180(<em>b</em>). Thean J’s
                    observations were approved by a five-member Court of Appeal in <em>Mok Swee Kok v Public Prosecutor</em> [1994]
                    3 SLR(R) 134 at [14], who went on to hold that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n our judgment, the recording of a statement of facts by the court
                        following an accused's plea of guilt, which began as a matter of practice
                            <em>which evolved primarily as a means of assisting
                            judges to determine the appropriate sentence</em>, <em>has evolved into a legal duty on the court to record a
                            statement of facts and to scrutinise the statement of facts for the
                            explicit purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge are
                            made out therein</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In his treatise on criminal procedure,
                    Professor Tan Yock Lin describes the legal requirement for a statement of
                    facts as “a salutary rule” in furtherance of the trial
                    judge’s duty “<em>to protect the accused from
                        himself</em>” [emphasis mine]: see Tan Yock Lin, <em>Criminal Procedure vol 2</em> (LexisNexis, 2010) at
                    XV[951].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I respectfully agree, and would add the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The requirement for a statement of
                        facts which sufficiently discloses the elements of the charge is a
                        freestanding imperative requirement. The marrow of due process requires the
                        court to be absolutely satisfied that there is congruence between the
                        accused person’s plea of guilt and an actual offence being made
                        out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Following
                        from (a), the court should always evaluate a statement of facts with fresh
                        lenses, without being influenced by the fact that the accused person has
                        pleaded guilty to the charge. There is no presumption that a statement of
                        facts will contain the elements of the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     As it is an agreed document between the parties,
                        the contents of the statement of facts can ordinarily be taken at face
                        value, and the task of the court will usually be to decide whether the
                        contents make out the offence charged. In this, the court should be very
                        slow to draw inferences to supply any deficiencies in the contents of the
                        statement of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     However, it will not always be the case that the contents of the
                        statement of facts can be taken at face value. There may be internal
                        inconsistencies or contradictions in the contents. The contents may be
                        inherently doubtful or incredulous, or otherwise call for further
                        explanation or inquiry. Further, the accused person may not always be in a
                        position to understand what he has apparently agreed to. The court should be
                        alert to these and other situations where there is reason to doubt what is
                        said in the statement of facts and or if it is
                    incomplete.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_e"></a>(e)     If the
                        court entertains any doubt as to the sufficiency of the statement of facts,
                        it should decline to record the plea of guilt and explain the reasons to the
                        parties. If they are agreeable, the parties can then amend the statement of
                        facts, and if the court is satisfied that the amended statement of facts
                        make out the charged offence, it can proceed to record the plea of guilt.
                        Otherwise, the matter should proceed to trial. Needless to say, no pressure
                        should be exerted on an accused person to agree to amend a deficient
                        statement of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_f"></a>(f)     The need for a careful scrutiny is especially important in cases
                        (such as the present) where the accused persons are unrepresented, do not
                        understand English, and/or might not grasp the finer legal points involved.
                        In such cases, the court should satisfy itself that the accused person
                        understands the ingredients of the offence. If an accused person is under a
                        misapprehension as to the offence to which he is pleading guilty, this may
                        be a ground for setting aside the plea on appeal or
                    revision.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_g"></a>(g)     As a
                        practical matter, the statement of facts should be drawn up by those skilled
                        in the preparation of evidence and knowledgeable about the legal ingredients
                        that are needed to constitute the relevant offence, and not by investigators
                        who may not appreciate the finer legal points.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_h"></a>(h)     The use of “template” statement of
                        facts for common offences should be eschewed. Every statement must be
                        customised to the facts of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To put things in
                    perspective, I should say that, if the Prosecution has satisfied itself that an
                    offence has been made out beyond reasonable doubt before bringing a charge, the
                    preparation of an adequate statement of facts would hardly be a difficult
                    task.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I should also point out, parenthetically, that
                    the statement of facts is also an important part of the sentencing process. As a
                    general rule, with regard to the particulars of the offence, parties should not
                    stray too far from the statement of facts in making their submissions on
                    sentence, unless they are prepared to prove what they say in a <em>Newton</em> hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In this case, the appellants were charged
                    under s 128I(<em>b</em>) of the Customs Act, which
                    provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Offences in relation to possession, storage, conveying
                            and harbouring of goods</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>128I</b>.    Any person who —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    is in any way
                                concerned in conveying, removing, depositing or dealing with any
                                dutiable, uncustomed or prohibited goods with intent to defraud the
                                Government of any customs duty or excise duty thereon, or to evade
                                any of the provisions of this Act; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">shall be guilty of an offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is plain that the offence is one which requires a <em>mens rea</em>, <em>viz</em>, the intent
                    to defraud the Government of any customs duty or excise duty thereon, or to
                    evade any of the provisions of the Customs Act. It also goes without saying that
                    the <em>mens rea</em> must be contemporaneous with the
                        <em>actus reus</em>. This was not disputed by
                    Ms Kan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Unfortunately, the requirement for
                    contemporaneity between the <em>mens rea</em> and the
                        <em>actus reus</em> appears to have been overlooked in
                    this case. The statement of facts, which was drawn up by an officer of the
                    Special Investigations Branch of Singapore Customs, contained nothing which
                    showed that the appellants had the requisite <em>mens
                        rea</em> at the material time (<em>ie</em>, when
                    they were handling the cigarettes). The bare statement of knowledge in
                    para 6 of the appellants’ joint statement of facts was insufficient
                    by itself as what was required was knowledge <em>at the material
                        time</em>. It is clear that the appellants were hired as manual
                    labour, and there is no basis for me to infer that they were told by those who
                    hired them that the cigarettes were uncustomed. (Indeed, according to what
                    Ms Kan informed the court, the appellants seemed not to have been told that
                    the cigarettes were uncustomed: above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>.
                    But for the avoidance of doubt, I should say that my decision was based solely
                    on the deficiency in the statement of facts.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     There was also an exchange between Ms Kan
                    and the court on the presumption of knowledge found in s 128L(6) of the
                    Customs Act. Ms Kan submitted that by virtue of s 128L(6) of the
                    Customs Act, the appellants are presumed to have knowledge that the cigarettes
                    were uncustomed until the contrary is proved. Section 128L(6) provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    In any prosecution against a person for
                            committing, attempting or abetting an offence under sections 128D to
                            128K, any dutiable, uncustomed or prohibited goods shall be deemed to be
                            dutiable, uncustomed or prohibited goods to the knowledge of the person,
                                <em>unless the contrary is proved by the
                                person</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In fairness to Ms Kan, I ought to point out that this
                    discussion was not directed specifically at the assessment of the statement of
                    facts in question. However, I should state, for the avoidance of doubt, that
                    evidential presumptions are inapplicable in assessing the sufficiency of a
                    statement of facts. As the proviso to s 180(<em>b</em>) of the Criminal Procedure Code makes clear, the court must,
                    before it records a plea of guilt, be satisfied that the accused person intends
                    to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him. This would not
                    be the case if the accused admits to a statement of facts which is inherently
                    deficient and requires the application of an evidential presumption before the
                    offence can be said to have been made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The appellants’ pleas of guilt were
                    therefore deficient at law and should not have been accepted by the district
                    judge. This was a sufficient ground for the pleas to be set aside, and, I should
                    add, set aside <em>ex debito justitiae</em>. I accordingly
                    made no order on the Prosecution’s motion to adduce further evidence. I
                    likewise make no comment on the merits of the Prosecution’s case beyond
                    what is said here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After setting aside the appellants’
                    pleas of guilt, I ordered the matter to be remitted to the district court for
                    fresh pleas to be taken. I requested the ranking Prisons officer escorting the
                    appellants to assist them in contacting the relevant legal aid body. Given that
                    the appellants had already been incarcerated for about three months (including
                    the period they were remanded) when they came before me, I also indicated in my
                    minutes that the subordinate courts should arrange for a trial as soon as
                    possible if the appellants elect to claim trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     For completeness, I should record here that
                    pursuant to an application by the customs prosecutor to withdraw all charges
                    against the appellants, all four appellants were given a discharge amounting to
                    an acquittal on 13 December 2010 when they were produced in the district
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations on sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Given the course which the appeals had taken,
                    I did not have to deal with the questions of sentence on which the appeals had
                    initially come before me. However, I would like to make some brief observations
                    on what appears to be the questionable sentencing practice for similar
                    offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On a review of the cases, it appears that
                    considerable weight is given to the amount of custom or excise duty evaded. This
                    would be an eminently sensible approach to take towards those offenders who
                    stand to benefit directly from the amount of duty evaded. In contrast, it is not
                    obvious that the same approach is appropriate in cases where the offenders are
                    only involved in a menial or otherwise minor role and do not stand to benefit
                    directly in any meaningful way from the amount of duty evaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In a related vein, it also appears that
                    significant weight is ordinarily placed on the fact that an accused person acted
                    as part of a group. Here I would like to stress that there are group offences
                    and there are group offences. And within each group of offenders there might
                    well be varying degrees of culpability. It would be incorrect to invariably
                    assume that a person who offends as part of a group is always more culpable than
                    another person who offends on his own. Each case must turn on a close
                    examination of its facts, for which a bland recitation of general principles is
                    no substitute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There is to-date no reasoned decision of the
                    High Court which examines the appropriate sentencing approach and tariffs for
                    this genre of cases. The case relied upon by the district judge, <em>Moey Keng Kong v Public Prosecutor</em> [2001]
                    2 SLR(R) 867, concerned an accused person acting alone. A review
                    should be undertaken in an appropriate case. In the meantime, perhaps the
                    subordinate courts should view the existing sentencing precedents dealing with
                    those having subsidiary roles in offences involving uncustomed goods with some
                    caution. It seems to me that the sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment
                    imposed by the district judge on each of the appellants, who stood only to
                    receive $30 to $40 for their efforts, was wholly disproportionate to their
                    actual culpability even if they were guilty as charged. This is especially so
                    considering that Voon Qing Lai, the mastermind who stood to benefit
                    substantially from this offending episode, was sentenced to 30 months’
                    imprisonment under section 128(L)(4) of the Customs Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Smugglers, and members of their syndicates,
                    should of course receive adequately deterrent sentences for their offending
                    conduct. But this does not mean that ordinary sentencing precepts, such as
                    proportionality, do not continue to apply in assessing the appropriate sentences
                    to be meted out to them.</p>
