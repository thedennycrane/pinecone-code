If he arrives at a holding on an issue of law in his determination which is wrong, and he does so without hearing from the parties on that issue, has he breached the rules of natural justice? Or has he simply made an error of law? That is the issue raised by the application before me now.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In the adjudication out of which this application arises, the adjudicator issued a determination in favour of the defendant (the claimant in the adjudication). In his determination, the adjudicator held that the plaintiff (the respondent in the adjudication) had to satisfy the adjudicator beyond reasonable doubt that the deductions it claimed to be entitled to make from the defendant’s payment claim were valid deductions. The adjudicator arrived at this holding without soliciting or receiving submissions from either party on what standard of proof (using that term loosely (see [34] below)), the plaintiff had to meet to satisfy the adjudicator on the validity of its deductions. Indeed, this evidential issue was at no time a live issue in the adjudication. The plaintiff now seeks to set aside the adjudication determination on the principal basis that the adjudicator breached his obligation under s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act to comply with the principles of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After hearing and considering the parties’ submissions, and given the unusual features of this case, I have set aside the adjudication determination.

The defendant therefore posited that the doors were shattering because they were striking the walls when slid open.

The defendant’s position was that, if the doors were found to be shattering because they were coming into contact with the wall when slid open, the defendant would contest any back charge arising from the shattering doors and would consider any remedial work which the plaintiff might require to be a variation of their subcontract, and therefore to be carried out at the plaintiff’s cost.

</div> First, the design of the shower frames required a 30mm buffer between the vertical edge of the glass door and the wall in order to avoid the edge striking the wall when it was slid open. However, the architect found that some frames had been installed with a buffer which was less than 30mm. Second, the rollers in the aluminium tracks for the doors allowed the doors to slide too freely. The doors therefore picked up too much speed and momentum when slid open. Both of these factors increased the likelihood of a glass door striking the wall at high speed and shattering, even when it was opened in normal usage.

Third, the doors were to be laminated with safety film so that, even if the door did strike the wall and shatter, the laminate would hold the shards of glass in place to prevent injury.

Second, the plaintiff was seeking to deduct the entire cost of remedying the shower frames in The Hillford even though it could not prove that the defendant had installed all of those shower frames with a gap of less than 30mm.

</div> The defendant’s final point was that the poor quality of the evidence which the plaintiff had produced in the adjudication meant that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of proof. As a result, and because of the inherent evidential limitations of the adjudication process, the defendant submitted that the adjudicator was not in a position to decide the plaintiff’s entitlement to a set-off.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Further, the [defendant] submits that it is not possible for the Learned Adjudicator to take a robust approach in this case to decide on the [plaintiff’s] entitlement to set-off due to the [plaintiff’s] failure to make out its claim by failing to particularise the alleged breaches of the [defendant] and <span class="font-italic">failure to provide sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proof for the proposition advanced by it with regards the work carried out by the [defendant] (which the [defendant] maintains is in compliance with the shop drawings) and the link, if any, between the buffer gap and the shattered glass incident.</span> Further, without the benefit of a fact-intensive investigation and expert evidence on the issues, the Learned Adjudicator is not equipped to deal with the present issues arising from the alleged breach of non-compliance with the shop drawings, notwithstanding that … such an exercise is also unsuitable to be undertaken in these SOP proceedings. The [defendant] humbly submits that this is not the forum to decide the Respondent’s entitlement to set-off and accordingly, the Learned Adjudicator should only allow the [defendant’s] claim in respect of work done by the [defendant]. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It is, of course, not strictly speaking correct to speak of either party in an adjudication application as having a burden of <span class="font-italic">proof</span>. That is simply because neither side in an adjudication has any obligation to “prove” its case to the adjudicator in the sense of demonstrating to the adjudicator that its case is objectively true (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> s 3(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)). Determining whether a party has demonstrated its case to be true is not the function of an adjudicator. The function of an adjudicator is to determine the issues listed in s 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act, the most important of which is the amount, if any, out of the applicant’s payment claim to which temporary finality ought to attach under s 21(1) of the Act. It is therefore no part of the adjudicator’s role to find whether the claimant’s payment claim – or indeed the respondent’s deduction from it – has or has not been <span class="font-italic">proven</span>. That finding is within the exclusive province of the dispute-resolution tribunal which will resolve the parties’ dispute with full finality (see s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In adjudication proceedings, therefore, it is more accurate to speak of a burden of persuasion. The claimant hopes to persuade the adjudicator to give temporary finality to the entirety of the claim. The respondent hopes to persuade the adjudicator to withhold temporary finality from all or part of the claim. Each party who advances a proposition to the adjudicator bears the burden of persuading the adjudicator to accept that proposition in and for the purposes of the adjudication. The defendant was therefore correct, in a loose sense, to submit that the plaintiff bore the burden of persuading the adjudicator that he should withhold temporary finality from $78,659.96 out of the defendant’s payment claim by reason of the shattering glass doors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 But the defendant, having challenged the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s evidence, did not propose in its further submissions a qualitative test which the adjudicator could apply to ascertain whether the plaintiff had “provide[d] sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proof”. To put it another way, the adjudicator was not given a qualitative standard against which to weigh the plaintiff’s evidence in the adjudication. That qualitative test is, of course, analogous to the standard of proof where a decision is to be reached with full finality. In the current context, for accuracy and consistency, I shall refer to that qualitative test as the “standard of persuasion”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The plaintiff too lodged further written submissions on 24 April 2017.

</div> The skeletal arguments took the form of a paragraph by paragraph response to the defendant’s further submissions. The plaintiff made four principal points.

I therefore find it strange that for about three months after the discussion with the third party was held, there is still no report available for this adjudication proceeding. I am not aware of the reason for the absence of the report and why the [plaintiff] did not present it as evidence. This is my first doubt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Paragraph 52 of the adjudicator’s determination – which I have included in the passage cited at [41] above – is a reference to three entries in a spreadsheet which the plaintiff tendered in the adjudication as evidence of the attendance costs which formed part of its deduction of $78,659.96. That spreadsheet records that on 9 January 2017, the plaintiff, the developer and the developer’s consultants had a discussion on site with an external glass specialist on producing a third-party expert report. On 13 January 2017, a “Noptic Glass Test” was carried out in the presence of the plaintiff and the developer’s consultants to detect whether nickel sulphide inclusions in the glass panels were causing them to shatter spontaneously. And on 26 January 2017 and 26 February 2017, the plaintiff and the developer’s consultants are recorded as carrying out a “site inspection …for 3rd party report”.

</div> If the adjudicator wished to adopt persuasion beyond reasonable doubt as the standard of persuasion which the plaintiff had to meet, the fair hearing rule required the adjudicator to give both parties an opportunity to address him on the issue. Although the adjudicator’s breach of that rule in this case led him to make what both parties agree was an error of law, that is not the gist of the plaintiff’s challenge. The plaintiff in substance is challenging, not the <span class="font-italic">content</span> of the adjudicator’s decision, but his <span class="font-italic">conduct</span> in arriving at that decision.

</div> It is, the defendant argues, not a breach of natural justice for a decision-maker to fail to hear from the parties on an issue on which they do not take opposing positions. Second, there was no breach of natural justice because this is not a case where an adjudicator heard from one party and accepted that party’s position on an issue without hearing from the other party. In this case, the adjudicator failed to hear from <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 On both points, the defendant is wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Underlying the rules of natural justice is the recognition that procedural fairness has intrinsic value. Ensuring that a decision-making process is fair is inherently valuable because it accords dignity to those persons who participate in the process and whose interests are affected by the decision which is the outcome of the process. But procedural fairness also has instrumental value. Given that it is virtually impossible to be assured that the outcome of any decision-making process is objectively “correct” – or even, in some cases, “fair” – according procedural fairness to those who participate in the process and are affected by its outcome makes it more likely that they, and the wider community that they come from, will accept the legitimacy of the decision even if they do not accept its substance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Both components of the rules of natural justice therefore have both intrinsic and instrumental value. In the particular case of the fair hearing rule, it has added instrumental value in that hearing from the parties contributes to rectitude of decision. That is particularly so in adversarial proceedings, which is what adjudication applications remain by their fundamental nature. Adversarial proceedings are founded on the expectation that an objectively correct decision is more likely to emerge from a contest of self-interested submissions by the parties rather than from a decision-maker’s self-directed inquiries and ingenuity. To put it simply, hearing from the parties before arriving at a decision not only helps to ensure that the parties accept the legitimacy of the decision but also assists the decision-maker in getting the decision objectively right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Given this background, there are two reasons why I reject the defendant’s submissions. First, it is certainly true that a decision-maker who fails to hear from both parties will have treated them both equally and, in that sense, acted with impartiality. But the failure is nevertheless a breach of the fair hearing rule. That is because the failure leads to the very harm – both on an individual basis and on a systemic basis – which the rules of natural justice seek to avoid. On the individual basis, failing to hear from both parties on an issue before arriving at a decision on that issue is equally capable of giving rise to a lingering procedural grievance as failing to hear from one party before doing so. If, following that failure, the decision-maker arrives at a decision which neither party desires, both parties will harbour a procedural grievance. And if the decision-maker arrives at a decision which only one party desires, the procedural grievance harboured by the unsuccessful party is indistinguishable in principle from the grievance he would harbour if the decision-maker had in fact heard only from the successful party. On the individual level, then, both cases lead to an increased risk that one or both parties will reject the legitimacy of the decision. That is one of the very risks which the rules of natural justice are designed to mitigate. On the systemic level, a failure to hear from both parties is equally capable of undermining the legitimacy of the decision-making process in the eyes of potential participants who are not parties to the particular case at hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58  Second, because part of the underlying purpose of requiring the decision-maker to hear from both parties on an issue is the instrumental purpose of increasing rectitude of decision, it is equally a breach of natural justice not to hear from the parties where they are agreed on an issue as it is when that issue is contested. A decision-maker who decides an issue without hearing from both parties on that issue deprives himself of a specific forensic benefit which the adversarial system offers him. The forensic benefit is clear where the parties are opposed on the issue. It arises from the decision-maker hearing and testing the parties’ submissions in competition with each other. But there is equally a forensic benefit even when the parties are agreed on the issue. The benefit arises from the opportunity which hearing from both parties gives the decision-maker to avoid error.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The defendant’s submissions proceed on two fundamental misconceptions. The first is to frame the issue before the adjudicator at too high a level of generality. Thus, the defendant submits that the issue before the adjudicator was whether the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for the shattering glass doors.

</div>
</div> Therefore, the defendant says, the adjudicator cannot have breached the rules of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 All of that may be true, but only because the defendant has framed the issue for present purposes in the same terms as the ultimate issue in the adjudication. The defendant overlooks that there were subsidiary issues on the adjudicator’s path to his decision on the ultimate issue. The adjudicator had an equally real obligation under s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act to comply with the principles of natural justice in dealing with those subsidiary issues. One of those issues, which emerged only in his determination, was the applicable standard of persuasion which the plaintiff had to meet. And it is not to the point to say that the plaintiff had an opportunity in a general sense to deal with this subsidiary issue. It is, of course, true that the plaintiff had every opportunity to address the adjudicator on any issue it wished to in its written and oral submissions. So in that sense, the adjudicator did afford the plaintiff a general opportunity to be heard on all issues. But that general opportunity to be heard on any issue cannot constitute a specific opportunity to be beard on the issue of the applicable standard of persuasion. That is because the standard of persuasion was never a live issue in the adjudication. As a result, the plaintiff had no notice that the adjudicator was going to decide that issue as a subsidiary issue on his way to his ultimate determination of the ultimate issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The defendant’s second fundamental error is to assume that a breach of natural justice and an error of fact or law operate on the same plane, such that a particular aspect of the adjudicator’s determination can be only one or the other but not both. The defendant therefore begins by characterising the adjudicator’s error in this case as an error of law and not a breach of natural justice and then submits that where there is an error of law, there cannot be a breach of natural justice.

</div> between conduct – or process – and outcome is crucial. A breach of natural justice operates on the procedural plane and is a feature of the decision-maker’s <span class="font-italic">conduct</span> in his decision-making. An error of law operates on the outcome plane and is a feature of the substance of his decision-making. A breach of natural justice may or may not result in an error of law. If it does, the error of law does not subsume the breach of natural justice. The parties are agreed in this case that the adjudicator’s holding on the standard of persuasion was an error. But characterising it as an error of law does not operate to immunise his anterior breach of the rules of natural justice from challenge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The defendant relies on the decision of Colman J in <span class="font-italic">Bulfracht</span><span class="font-italic"> (Cyprus) Ltd v Boneset Shipping Company Ltd (“MV Pamphilos”)</span> [2002] EWHC 2292 to suggest that the adjudicator in this case did not breach the rules of natural justice because he had no duty to forewarn the parties of his intended holdings and therefore, presumably, had no duty to forewarn the plaintiff that he intended to hold that the plaintiff had to persuade the adjudicator of its case in the adjudication beyond reasonable doubt.

</div>
</div>
</div> The passage from Colman J’s judgment on which the defendant relies reads as follows (at page 7/13):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…In substance, [the charterers’] complaint is that the arbitrators made findings of fact of which they did not forewarn the parties and for which there was no evidential basis. They thereby unfairly deprived the charterers of the opportunity of addressing them on those matters and therefore failed to provide a fair means for the resolution of the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The arbitrator’s duty was to give the parties a fair opportunity of addressing them on all factual issues material to the intended decision as to which there had been no reasonable opportunity to address them during the hearings ….</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It has to be emphasised, however, that the duty to act fairly is quite distinct from the autonomous power of the arbitrators to make findings of fact. Thus, whereas it may normally be contrary to the arbitrator’s duty to fail to give the parties an opportunity to address them on proposed findings of major areas of material primary facts which have not been raised during the hearing or earlier in the arbitral proceedings, it will not usually be necessary to refer back to the parties for further submission every single inference of fact from the primary facts which the arbitrators intend to draw, even if such inferences may not have been previously anticipated in the course of the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The defendant’s reliance on this passage is misplaced. This passage establishes that a decision-maker who reaches a decision without affording the parties an opportunity to address him on that decision does not necessarily breach the rules of natural justice, even if the parties could not have anticipated that decision. But this passage also establishes that it is normally contrary to the rules of natural justice for a decision-maker to arrive at a decision on a major issue without affording the parties an opportunity to address him on that issue. All the more so if that issue is not a live issue. That is precisely what the plaintiff submits the adjudicator did in this case.

</div>
</div> In that passage, I said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A] tribunal is not required to refer every issue which falls for decision to the parties for submissions. A tribunal’s decision may be considered unfair only when a reasonable litigant in the position of the party challenging the award could not have foreseen the possibility of the tribunal’s actual reasoning in the award... </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 That proposition, when read in full and in context, assists the plaintiff more than the defendant. The adjudicator’s holding that the plaintiff had to persuade him of the defendant’s liability beyond reasonable doubt was a decision which a reasonable party to an adjudication in the position of the plaintiff could not have foreseen. That is so, not because the adjudicator’s holding is objectively wrong, but because the applicable standard of persuasion was never a live issue in the adjudication. Indeed, for that very reason, I daresay that even a reasonable party in the position of the <span class="font-italic">defendant</span> could not have foreseen that the adjudicator would arrive at that holding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 A final point troubled me in the course of the parties’ submissions. It seemed to me that the adjudicator’s breach of natural justice in this case arose because the issue in question – the applicable standard of persuasion – was to him an unknown unknown. He did not know that he did not know the standard of persuasion which the plaintiff had to meet as a matter of procedural law in order to discharge its burden. As a result, he did not know that he required assistance on this issue and did not appreciate that he should afford both parties an opportunity to render that assistance to him. Does that make a difference? To put it another way, is it a breach of natural justice for a decision-maker to fail to hear from the parties on an issue when he does not appreciate the need to hear from them on that issue? I consider that that is nevertheless a breach of natural justice. The focus of the rules of natural justice is not on the subjective moral or legal quality of a decision-maker’s conduct, but on the objective effect which his conduct has on the fairness of the decision-making process and on the stakeholders in that process, including the parties to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For all these reasons, therefore, I have found that the adjudicator did breach the rules of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The breach was material</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defendant’s next submission is that the breach of natural justice was not material to the adjudicator’s determination. It is certainly true that not every breach of natural justice will result in an adjudication determination being set aside. There are two aspects of materiality. The first is whether the breach of natural justice was causally connected with the adjudicator’s determination. This requires considering the role played in his determination by his holding that the standard of persuasion which the plaintiff had to meet amounted to persuasion beyond reasonable doubt. I deal with that aspect of the submission in this section of the judgment. The other aspect is whether the breach of natural justice caused the plaintiff prejudice. I will deal with that issue in the next section of this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 My analysis of the adjudicator’s determination (see [39] to [45] above) shows that the adjudicator’s on the standard of persuasion was an integral part of the framework of his decision. It was one step on the critical path which led to his determination in the defendant’s favour. It would have been different, for example, if the adjudicator had formulated the plaintiff’s standard of persuasion as persuasion beyond reasonable doubt but analysed the evidence to explain why he could not accept the plaintiff’s evidence as sufficient to raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case. In that hypothetical situation, it could be said that the adjudicator’s formulation of the standard of persuasion in terms of proof beyond reasonable doubt was a mere matter of semantics, given that he had adopted the correct analytical approach in assessing the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s evidence. It would be difficult in that hypothetical scenario to hold that the adjudicator’s formulation had been causally connected to his determination because his analysis would show that he had not applied it in arriving at his determination. But that is not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The adjudicator’s formulation of the standard of persuasion as being persuasion beyond reasonable doubt was a matter of substance rather than semantics. The adjudicator understood the import of his formulation of the standard and went on actually to apply that standard as the framework of his entire analysis. Thus, he rejected the plaintiff’s case in the adjudication because – and only because – he harboured the six reasonable doubts about it which he enumerated in his determination at (see [43] to [44] above). There is a clear causal connection between the adjudicator’s breach of natural justice and his holding on the issue of the standard of persuasion, and a clear causal connection between that holding and the outcome of his determination. In that sense, then, the breach of natural justice was material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The defendant submits that the part of the adjudicator’s decision where he lists his reasonable doubts was no more than ancillary to his decision on the main issue of liability.

</div> It was not:  for the reasons I have set out above, it was at the core of his determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The defendant also suggests that the plaintiff’s submission amounts to attacking the weighing exercise which the adjudicator undertook to assess whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence to meet its burden of proof. But the defendant misunderstands why the plaintiff makes reference to the adjudicator’s reasoning. The plaintiff’s argument is not that the determination should be set aside because the adjudicator’s reasoning in analysing the plaintiff’s evidence is faulty. The plaintiff’s argument remains that the determination should be set aside because the adjudicator failed to hear from the parties on the applicable standard of persuasion. The plaintiff relies on the adjudicator’s reasoning, not to establish error, but to establish a causal connection between the breach of natural justice and the outcome of his determination. That is a causal connection which I accept exists. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The breach caused the plaintiff actual prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The defendant’s final submission is that the adjudicator’s breach of natural justice did not cause the plaintiff any prejudice.

</div>
</div> I reject this submission also.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In order to assess prejudice, I must consider the counterfactual situation in which the adjudicator had heard from the parties on the standard of persuasion. If that had happened, the parties are agreed that they would both have submitted to the adjudicator that it sufficed for the plaintiff to raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that it was entitled to deduct $78,659.96 from the defendant’s claim in and for the purposes of the adjudication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In that counterfactual situation, two consequences would have flowed. First, it is virtually certain that the adjudicator would have accepted the parties’ common submission that the applicable standard of persuasion was the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard. It would be highly unusual for an adjudicator to reject a common position taken by both parties represented by counsel. That is especially so when counsel take a common position on a question of law and the adjudicator, as the adjudicator was in this case, is not legally trained. It would be even more unusual for an adjudicator who is not legally trained to reject the parties’ common position on a question of <span class="font-italic">procedural</span> law. I consider it legitimate to take this factor into consideration as prejudice. It does not amount to me usurping the function of the adjudicator or substituting my judgment for his. That is because the issue of the applicable standard of persuasion is an issue does not have to do with the merits of the parties’ claims in the adjudication – which is within the exclusive province of the adjudicator – and will not be revisited when the substantive dispute between the parties is resolved with full finality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The second consequence is that the adjudicator’s determination on the merits of the adjudication – arrived at after applying the correct standard of persuasion – <span class="font-italic">could</span> have been different from that which he actually reached after applying the incorrect standard. To draw an analogy with arbitration by paraphrasing <span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 (at [54]), the plaintiff will have suffered prejudice arising from this breach of the rules of natural justice if it can show that compliance with the rules of natural justice <span class="font-italic">could reasonably</span> have made a difference to the outcome of the adjudication. The plaintiff need not show that it <span class="font-italic">would necessarily</span> have done so. Certainly, if the adjudicator had not breached the rules of natural justice and received a common submission from the parties that the plaintiff need only raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, he <span class="font-italic">could</span> have accepted that common submission. Indeed, for the reasons I have given at [75] above, he is almost certain to have done so. If he had done so, the structure of his analysis in his determination <span class="font-italic">could</span> have been different. Whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of persuasion would no longer turn on whether the adjudicator harboured a reasonable doubt. In the counterfactual, applying the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard, the adjudicator <span class="font-italic">could</span> have eschewed the negative approach of identifying and listing the reasonable doubts which he continued to harbour about the plaintiff’s case, even after considering the plaintiff’s evidence. The adjudicator <span class="font-italic">could</span> instead have adopted the positive approach of marshalling and analysing the plaintiff’s evidence to see whether it was sufficient to persuade him that, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, he ought not to confer temporary finality on $78,659.96 of the defendant’s claim in and for the purposes of the adjudication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The defendant submits that the plaintiff did not suffer prejudice because, even if the adjudicator had invited the parties to address him on the applicable standard of persuasion, and even if the adjudicator had adopted and applied the standard which the parties are agreed he ought to have applied, his decision would have been no different because the plaintiff’s evidence did not suffice even to raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case.

</div>
</div> I reject that submission.  As a judge exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the adjudicator, it is not appropriate or desirable for me to base my decision on whether to set aside the adjudication determination on my own weighing of the evidence before the adjudicator, applying the correct standard of persuasion. For the reasons I have set out at [76] above, I accept that the adjudicator’s analysis and therefore his determination <span class="font-italic">could</span> have been different and that that suffices to demonstrate prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s four other grounds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The reasons set out above suffice for me to set aside the adjudicator’s determination on the grounds that he breached the rules of natural justice. It is therefore not necessary for me to consider the plaintiff’s three other grounds (see [47] above). In any event, I do not consider any of those grounds to be independent of the first ground in any true sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The plaintiff’s second ground is that the adjudicator breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give the plaintiff an opportunity to address the adjudicator on the relevance of the BCA Code. It is true that this point was not advanced by the defendant in the adjudication and that the adjudicator did not hear from the plaintiff on this point before including it in his determination as one of his reasonable doubts about the plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 But I do not consider that to be a ground which is independent of the plaintiff’s first ground. If the adjudicator had been procedurally correct in his formulation of the standard of persuasion, his approach to analysing whether the plaintiff had met that standard could not be faulted. On that hypothesis, the plaintiff’s second ground would not have sufficed in and of itself to set aside the adjudication determination. This is because, even if this particular finding of a reasonable doubt had been reached in breach of natural justice, the result would be to remove only one out of the six reasonable doubts identified by the adjudicator. The finding on the BCA Code reached in breach of natural justice would therefore not be causally connected with the outcome of the determination and could not, in itself, justify setting it aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The plaintiff’s third ground is that the adjudicator misdirected himself by adopting irrelevant considerations in arriving at his determination because he focused on the factual cause of the glass doors shattering rather than focusing on the identity of the party to be held responsible for it. I would have difficulty accepting that this ground was made out in the case and, even if made out, that it justified setting aside the adjudication determination in itself. It is not possible to separate the factual and legal responsibility for the shattering glass doors from the factual cause of the doors shattering. For example, if the factual cause of the doors shattering was defective materials, legal responsibility for the loss would rest with the defendant. In any event, as with the BCA Code, if this misdirection was the only error which the adjudicator had made, it would have affected only one out of his six reasonable doubts. His analysis would still have rested on at least four other reasonable doubts. Thus, this alleged misdirection, even if established, would have had no causal connection to the adjudicator’s ultimate determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The plaintiff’s fourth ground is that the adjudicator breached his duty of impartiality. The plaintiff put this argument, it appears, in two ways. First, the plaintiff submits that by not hearing from the parties on the issue of the standard of persuasion and arriving at a decision adverse to the plaintiff, the adjudicator displayed a lack of impartiality. I do not accept the plaintiff’s submission on this point. As far as the process is concerned, as I have already mentioned, the fact that the adjudicator failed to hear from <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties on this issue <span class="font-italic">demonstrates</span> his impartiality rather than falsifying it. And as far as the adverse outcome is concerned, the mere fact that an adjudicator arrives at a decision which is adverse to a party cannot even constitute <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of a lack of impartiality, at least where the adjudicator has treated the parties equally in the procedural sense. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The second way in which the plaintiff puts the impartiality argument is that the framework which the adjudicator adopted for his reasoning in the critical part of his determination – which I have summarised at [40] to [45] above – suggests that the adjudicator had predetermined the issue of the shattering glass doors against the plaintiff and was reasoning backwards to support a predetermined outcome. I reject this argument also. There is no basis in the adjudicator’s reasoning for suggesting that the adjudicator lacked impartiality by reason of predetermination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The unusual features of this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 My decision to set aside this adjudication determination must be understood in the context of the many unusual features of this case. It is unusual for an adjudicator to fail to hear from both parties to an adjudication application before arriving at a holding on an issue of law. It is unusual for an adjudicator to fail to do so because he does not know that he needs assistance on that issue of law. It is unusual for the parties to agree that they would have made identical submissions to the adjudicator on that issue of law if he had solicited submissions before arriving at his holding. And it is unusual to be able to draw a clear line of causal connection from a breach of natural justice to an adjudicator’s holding of law, from his holding of law to the critical path to his decision and through his critical path to his ultimate determination. If any of those features had been missing in this case, I would almost certainly not have set aside the determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Thus, for example, I would not have set the determination aside if the adjudicator had failed to hear from the parties on the standard of persuasion but had instead reframed question (a) (see [40] above) as follows: “Is the defendant <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> responsible and liable for the shattering shower screen glass panels?”. In that situation, at least, the adjudicator would have posed the right question for himself. There would still be a notional breach of natural justice, but the breach would no longer be causally connected to the adjudicator’s holding of law. Hearing from the parties could not have made any difference to his holding. There are then two alternatives approaches which the adjudicator could have taken. If the adjudicator had gone on in his determination to adopt the <span class="font-italic">wrong</span> approach to answering the right question – <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by looking for reasonable doubts instead of <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence – that would still not warrant setting aside the determination. The fact would remain that there was no causal connection between the breach of natural justice and his holding of law. The first link in the chain of causation being already broken, that precludes a causal connection between the breach of natural justice and his error of approach. If, instead, the adjudicator had gone on to apply the <span class="font-italic">right</span> approach to answering the right question, in addition to there being no causal connection between the breach of natural justice and the adjudicator’s approach, there would also be no prejudice to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 By the same token, I would not have set aside the determination if the adjudicator had heard conflicting submissions from the parties on whether the standard of persuasion should be persuasion of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case or persuasion beyond reasonable doubt and had framed question (a) (see [40] above) without modification. Given that he had complied with the rules of natural justice by hearing both parties on this issue of law, and given that the parties’ submissions to him on the issue conflicted, his holding that the plaintiff had to satisfy him beyond reasonable doubt rather than simply to raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case would have been nothing more than an error of law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Similarly, I would not have set the determination aside if the adjudicator had failed to hear from the parties on the standard of persuasion, framed question (a) (see [40] above) without modification and then analysed the plaintiff’s evidence positively, searching for a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, rather than negatively, searching for reasonable doubts. In that situation, there would have been a breach of natural justice which was causally connected to the question which the adjudicator framed for himself. But that would have been an unusual case where – because the parties are agreed on the standard of persuasion and because the adjudicator applied that very standard of persuasion in his analysis despite framing his question in different terms – the plaintiff would be unable to show that the adjudicator’s decision <span class="font-italic">could</span> have been different in the counterfactual situation where the adjudicator had heard the parties on the standard of persuasion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 By contrast to the three preceding examples, there is in this case a direct causal connection running from the breach of natural justice through every element of the adjudicator’s analysis directly to the outcome of the determination. Given the unusual features, I have no alternative but to set the determination aside. If the system of adjudication is to have the legitimacy necessary to perform the function for which Parliament intended it, it is essential that stakeholders have confidence in the process. Where an adjudicator breaches his duty under s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act to comply with the principles of natural justice in these circumstances, the breach is not a mere technicality. It gives rise, in an objective sense, to a legitimate procedural concern sufficient to engage the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The framework I have adopted in this judgment mirrors very closely the circumstances under which a court will set aside an arbitration award for breach of natural justice under s 24(b) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”). Resolved to its elements, that provision requires: (i) a breach of the rules of natural justice to have occurred: (ii) a connection between the breach and the making of the arbitral award; and (iii) actual prejudice to the rights of a party going beyond the nominal prejudice arising from the breach itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Given that not every breach of an adjudicator’s obligation to comply with the principles of natural justice under s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Act will result in his adjudication determination being set aside, and given that the Act provides no guidance as to when a breach of s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) does warrant setting aside an adjudication determination, the framework of s 24(b) of the IAA appears to me to be a useful <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> approach to see precisely which breaches of natural justice will have that warrant setting aside an adjudication determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The arbitration framework, however, is applicable by analogy rather than directly. An application to set aside an adjudication determination (or to set aside an order granting leave to enforce an adjudication determination under s 27 of the Act) is quite different from an application to set aside an arbitration award in at least two principal ways. First, an application to set aside an adjudication determination invokes the High Court’s inherent supervisory jurisdiction at common law over inferior courts and tribunals. An application to set aside an award in an international or a domestic arbitration invokes a jurisdiction created and defined by statute. Second, the purpose of adjudication is to arrive at a determination which carries only temporary finality. Procedural unfairness in adjudication therefore has no capacity to affect the parties’ substantive rights and obligations. Arbitration, on the other hand determines the parties’ rights and obligations with full finality. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 For all of the reasons above, I have set aside the adjudication determination. It follows that the sum of $89,451.95 which the plaintiff paid into court as a prerequisite for pursuing this application must be released to the plaintiff. I have also ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs fixed at $8,700 plus reasonable disbursements to be taxed if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">David Ong and Magdalene Ong (David Ong &amp; Co) for the plaintiff;<br/>Crystal Phuar (Michael Por Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
