        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”), who upheld the decision of the
                    assistant registrar (“the AR”) to grant a stay of proceedings in
                    Suit No 379 of 2009 (“the Singapore Action”), an action
                    commenced in Singapore by the appellant, Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd
                    (“the Appellant”), against the respondent, Hwang Jae Woo
                    (“the Respondent”). The grounds of decision of the Judge may be
                    found at <em>Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae
                        Woo</em> [2010] 3 SLR 684 (“the GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       To better appreciate the circumstances giving
                    rise to the Singapore Action, we will first set out the facts of the case. The
                    Appellant is a company incorporated in Singapore. Its majority shareholder and
                    director is one Seung Yong Chung (“Seung”), who is also a
                    substantial shareholder and director of a Malaysian company known as Sun Jin
                    Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd (“SJM”). The Respondent is a South Korean
                    citizen who was the acting project director for projects undertaken by SJM in
                    the Republic of Maldives (“the Maldives”). The exact legal
                    relationship between the Appellant and the Respondent is in dispute,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> although the Judge was tentatively of
                    the view that the Respondent was in fact employed by the Appellant at the
                    material time, albeit seconded to work for SJM in the Maldives (see the GD at
                    [31]; see also <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> below). On the factual
                    matrix of the present case, we do not see how we can disagree with this
                    finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent worked in the Maldives from
                    27 August 2006 to 1 February 2008. When the Respondent arrived in the
                    Maldives on 27 August 2006, he was given a letter of employment dated
                    15 August 2006 from SJM. The authenticity of this letter is disputed by the
                    Appellant. During the period while the Respondent was working in the Maldives,
                    he was the country representative, project director and project manager of SJM.
                    It is undisputed that the directors of SJM passed a resolution on 3 May
                    2007 appointing the Respondent as its country representative in the Maldives.
                    The work permit issued by the Maldivian authorities showed the Respondent as an
                    employee of SJM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant brought the Singapore Action
                    against the Respondent, claiming that the latter had (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) acted in breach of his duty to the Appellant by effecting
                    certain unauthorised payments to third parties, thereby causing the Appellant to
                    suffer loss. In accordance with the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed), the Respondent should have filed his defence to the Singapore
                    Action by 27 May 2009. Pursuant to an oral understanding between the
                    parties’ solicitors, the time for filing the Respondent’s defence
                    was extended to 5 June 2009. The Respondent filed his defence on that date,
                    but the document filed was rejected as the wrong suit number was stated in it.
                    The Respondent subsequently re-filed his defence (this time, successfully) on
                    8 June 2009. Thereafter, it was only on 31 July 2009 –
                    approximately one month and three weeks after the extended deadline for filing
                    the defence – that the Respondent applied (via Summons No 4061 of
                    2009 (“the Stay Application”)) for a stay of the Singapore Action
                    in favour of proceedings to be instituted in the Maldives as well as for an
                    extension of time to file the application. The Respondent also sought, as an
                    alternative to a stay of the Singapore Action, an order striking out
                    paras 3–23 of the Appellant’s statement of claim (“the
                    Statement of Claim”), which constitute substantially the whole of the
                    Statement of Claim, under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of
                Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The main unauthorised payments alluded to at
                        <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above, which form the bases of the
                    Singapore Action, are the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     a payment of US$175,000 as alleged
                        commission to one Ahmed Shahid (“Shahid”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     a payment of
                        US$101,982.37 to one Son Chang Ju (“Son”), a former employee
                        of the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       We should add that legal proceedings in
                    connection with the above two payments were earlier commenced in the Maldives,
                    and judgments have already been given by the courts there. The judgments in
                    those proceedings (which are different from the contemplated Maldivian
                    proceedings mentioned at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above)
                    include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     a judgment obtained by Shahid against
                        SJM for payment of US$175,000;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     a judgment
                        obtained by Son against SJM for payment of US$101,982.37.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At this juncture, we should further add that the
                    Respondent has successfully sued SJM in the Maldives (in Case
                    No 733/MC/2008 (“the Maldivian profit suit”)) for wrongful
                    termination of employment and compensation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In that action, the
                    Civil Court of the Maldives found that the Respondent was an employee of
                        SJM<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> (see [30] of the GD,
                    and <em>cf</em> the Judge’s tentative view (at [31]
                    of the GD) that the Respondent was an employee of the Appellant). Although SJM
                    is a separate legal entity from the Appellant, Seung is a substantial
                    shareholder and director of both companies (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above). In the circumstances, this begs the question: if the
                    Respondent had indeed made unauthorised payments to Shahid and Son, why did SJM
                    not raise that as a counterclaim in the Maldivian profit suit?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Before the Judge, broadly, two main issues were
                    raised:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, whether the Respondent, given
                        that he had taken steps in the Singapore Action and, further, had filed the
                        Stay Application long after the deadline prescribed by O 12 r 7(2)
                        of the Rules of Court, was precluded from applying for a stay of the
                        Singapore Action (“the First Issue”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, if the Respondent were not so
                        precluded, whether a stay of the Singapore Action should be granted on the
                        ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> (“the
                        Second Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge answered the First Issue
                    in the negative and the Second Issue in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The First Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Apropos the First Issue, the Judge applied
                        <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung and others</em>
                    [2010] 1 SLR 1192 (“<em>Chan</em>”) in
                    holding that the Respondent, despite having taken steps in the Singapore Action
                    (by, <em>inter alia</em>, filing his defence) and despite
                    having made the Stay Application late, was not precluded from applying to stay
                    the Singapore Action since there had not been any prejudice to the Appellant
                    which could not be compensated by costs (see the GD at [10]–[11]).
                    However, the Judge also expressed some reservations about the decision in
                        <em>Chan</em> (see the GD at [12]–[19]; see also
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> below). He seemed to be of the view
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     this court’s decision in
                            <em>Chan</em> was open to question because it was
                        based on case law which involved factual circumstances that were
                        significantly dissimilar to those found in <em>Chan</em> (see the GD at [12]–[13]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     the test of prejudice adopted in
                            <em>Chan</em> for determining whether a defendant
                        who had taken steps in the proceedings and who was also late in applying for
                        a stay should be precluded from making a stay application – namely,
                        the test of “whether there was any prejudice to the [plaintiff] which
                        could not be compensated by costs” (see the GD at [10]), which test
                        the Judge found to be applicable to the case before him (see the GD at [11])
                        – was unsatisfactory because it could lead to unsatisfactory results
                        in the context of stay applications (see the GD at [15] and
                    [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In expressing his reservations about <em>Chan</em>, the Judge suggested that the test of prejudice
                    should not be the sole or primary factor for determining whether a defendant
                    should be granted an extension of time to file a stay application as such a test
                    “place[d] an unfair burden on the plaintiff to show good reasons why a
                    defendant should not be allowed to make his application for a stay late”.
                    Instead, the Judge opined, “[t]he burden should be on the party who [was]
                    making the late application [for a stay of proceedings] to adduce good reasons
                    to show why he should be allowed to make his application although he [was] out
                    of time” (see, likewise, [16] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Second Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Turning to the Second Issue, the Judge applied
                    what is commonly called “the <em>Spiliada</em>
                    test” –
                    <em>ie</em>, the test laid down by the House of Lords (now
                    known as the Supreme Court of the UK) in <em>Spiliada Maritime
                        Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”) – to determine whether a stay of
                    the Singapore Action should be granted on the ground of <em>forum
                        non conveniens</em>. Under the first stage of that test, the question
                    which the court has to consider is whether there is <em>prima
                        facie</em> some other available forum having competent jurisdiction
                    that is more appropriate for the trial of the dispute in question. In this
                    regard, the connecting factors raised in the present case by counsel for the
                    respective parties and considered by the Judge were the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the governing law of the dispute
                        between the Appellant and the Respondent (“the
                        Dispute”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the identity of the employer of the Respondent under his employment
                        contract at the material time (“the Employment
                        Contract”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     the place where the Respondent carried out his work under the
                        Employment Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     the place where the Respondent’s alleged breaches of the
                        Employment Contract took place; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     the availability of key witnesses in the
                    Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After considering the evidence, the Judge came
                    to the tentative view that (as mentioned earlier at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) the Respondent was employed by the Appellant at the
                    material time but was seconded to work for SJM in the Maldives, and that since
                    the alleged breaches of the Employment Contract occurred in the Maldives,
                    Maldivian law was probably the governing law relating to those alleged breaches.
                    Further, and more importantly, as all the relevant witnesses were in the
                    Maldives and were not willing to come to Singapore to testify, on balance, the
                    Judge held, the relevant factors favoured the Maldives as the more appropriate
                    place for the trial of the Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Moving on to the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test (which entails a consideration of whether,
                    although there is <em>prima facie</em> another forum which
                    is the more appropriate forum for trial based on the first stage of the test,
                    there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay of
                    proceedings should nevertheless be refused), the Judge considered the following
                    factors raised by the Appellant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     the alleged non-availability of the
                        Maldivian courts as a forum for hearing the Dispute;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     the alleged unfair prejudice to the
                        Appellant due to the prior ruling of the Civil Court of the Maldives in the
                        Maldivian profit suit; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     the alleged disparity between Maldivian law and Singapore
                        law in terms of their respective states of development and the number of
                        causes of action which each of these systems of law could independently
                        offer to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge came to the conclusion
                    that the above factors were really without much substance and should not
                    preclude a stay of the Singapore Action from being ordered. He thus affirmed the
                    AR’s decision to stay that action on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the present appeal, the First Issue and the
                    Second Issue are being revisited, with the Appellant arguing that this court
                    should overturn the Judge’s decision on both of these
                issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The First Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s taking of steps in the proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     We will begin by considering the First Issue,
                    specifically, the significance of the fact that the Respondent filed the Stay
                    Application only after taking steps in the Singapore Action. In <em>Yeoh Poh San and another v Won Siok Wan</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 233 at [14], the High Court held that “[t]he very
                    reason why a defendant [was] required to apply for a stay of proceedings before
                    taking any step other than filing an appearance [was] because such …
                    other step [might] be construed as a submission to the court’s
                    jurisdiction”. The Appellant contends that the Respondent has taken steps
                    in the Singapore Action by including in the Stay Application (<em>inter alia</em>) a prayer to strike out substantially the whole of
                    the Statement of Claim as an alternative to a stay of proceedings. In support of
                    this contention, the Appellant cites the case of <em>Republic of
                        the Philippines v Maler Foundation and others</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 857, where the expression “step in the
                    proceedings” in s 4(3)(<em>b</em>) of the State
                    Immunity Act (Cap 313, 1985 Rev Ed) was interpreted and
                        explained.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In response,
                    the Respondent argues that for the purposes of O 12 r 7(2) of the
                    Rules of Court, the fact that he has taken a step in the proceedings or has
                    submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts does not <em>per se</em> disentitle him from applying for a
                        stay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Respondent submits that
                    such conduct would be “fatal only to a challenge to the [c]ourt’s
                    jurisdiction under Order 12 Rule 7(1)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In this connection, it must be borne in mind
                    that an application under O 12 r 7(2) for a stay of proceedings on the
                    ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is not the same as
                    an application under O 12 r 7(1) disputing the jurisdiction of the
                    Singapore courts. A stay application under O 12 r 7(2) accepts that
                    the Singapore courts have jurisdiction over the dispute in question, but asserts
                    that another jurisdiction is the more appropriate forum to try the dispute. This
                    difference between O 12 r 7(1) and O 12 r 7(2) was explained
                    by this court in <em>Chan</em> at [22] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The appellant [the plaintiff in the originating suit in <em>Chan</em>] relies on several cases to argue that an extension of
                        time under O 3 r 4, even if permissible, cannot
                        “cure” the fact that the respondents [the defendants in the
                        originating suit in <em>Chan</em>] had already taken
                        steps in the proceedings and submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore
                        courts. With respect, this argument is off the mark because whether a
                        litigant has <em>submitted</em> to the jurisdiction of the court is relevant only to
                        an application … under O 12 r 7(1), where the litigant is
                        taking the position that the court has <em>no jurisdiction</em> to hear the case. In
                        contrast, where the litigant applies for a stay under O 12 r 7(2)
                        on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, he in fact <em>accepts the court’s
                        jurisdiction</em> and is not to be treated as disputing it … The
                        respondents have undoubtedly participated in the Singapore proceedings by
                        filing their [d]efence. Although this would be a step in the proceeding that
                        might disentitle them from contesting jurisdiction under O 12
                        r 7(1), this does not mean that they are barred from applying for a
                        stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the present case, the Respondent is
                    applying for a stay of proceedings under O 12 r 7(2); he is not
                    disputing the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts pursuant to O 12
                    r 7(1). Indeed, the fact that the Respondent has submitted to the
                    jurisdiction of the Singapore courts cannot be challenged as he has already
                    filed his defence to the Singapore Action (and has also since amended his
                    original defence). As can be seen from the passage from [22] of <em>Chan</em> just quoted above, the filing of the defence by the
                    Respondent does not in itself disentitle him from applying for a stay of the
                    Singapore Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s late filing of the Stay Application </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In our view, the more pertinent question which
                    we must address <em>vis-à-vis</em> the First Issue concerns
                    the fact that the Respondent filed the Stay Application out of time.
                    Order 12 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court states that an application for a
                    stay of proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> must be filed “within the time limited for
                    serving a defence”. The Respondent should thus have filed the Stay
                    Application either by 27 May 2009 (the original deadline for filing his
                    defence) or, at the latest, by 5 June 2009 (the mutually-agreed extended
                    deadline for filing the defence). This in turn raises the question of what
                    considerations the court should take into account in deciding whether to
                    exercise its discretion to extend the time for filing a stay
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Under the Rules of Court, the <em>substantive</em> effect of a procedural default or
                    irregularity is provided for in O 2 r 1(2), which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]he Court <em>may</em>, on the ground that
                        there has been such a [procedural default] as is mentioned in [O 2
                        r 1(1)], and on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks just,
                        set aside either wholly or in part the proceedings in which the [procedural
                        default] occurred, any step taken in those proceedings or any document,
                        judgment or order therein or exercise its powers under these Rules to allow
                        such amendments (if any) to be made and to make such order (if any) dealing
                        with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Order 2 r 1(2) clearly confers a wide discretion on the
                    court to deal with procedural defaults as it does not specify the considerations
                    which the court should take into account in exercising that discretion. That
                    said, how this discretion should be exercised raises important questions as to
                    the relationship between procedural justice and substantive justice in our civil
                    litigation system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Apropos these questions, our courts have in
                    several cases consistently advocated one principle, namely, the need to strike a
                    balance between, on the one hand, instilling procedural discipline in civil
                    litigation and, on the other, permitting parties to present the substantive
                    merits of their respective cases to the court notwithstanding some procedural
                    irregularities (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>United
                        Overseas Bank Ltd v Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd</em> [2005]
                    2 SLR(R) 425 (“<em>UOB v Ng Huat
                        Foundations</em>”) at [4]–[9], <em>Lee
                        Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another
                        suit</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 757 (“<em>Lee Hsien Loong</em>”) at [36] and <em>Lee Chee
                        Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 537 at [82]). In a similar vein, <em>Singapore
                        Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler SC gen ed) (LexisNexis,
                    2009) (“<em>Pinsler 2009</em>”) states at
                    para 2/1/1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While sanctions are necessary to ensure that the parties do not disregard
                        [procedural] rules with impunity, the court’s reaction to
                        non-compliance must be tempered by the equally important principle that the
                        rules of procedure serve the substantive law, and that a party should not be
                        automatically deprived of his substantive rights by procedural error.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     While this principle of striking a balance
                    between the competing interests of procedural justice and substantive justice is
                    simple to state, it is by no means easy to apply in practice. In <em>UOB v Ng Huat Foundations</em>, it was held by the High Court
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    The quest for justice … entails a continuous
                            need to balance the procedural with the substantive. More than that, it
                            is a continuous attempt to ensure that both are <em>integrated</em>, as far as that is humanly possible. Both
                                <em>interact</em> with each other. One cannot
                            survive without the other. There must, therefore, be – as far as
                            is possible – a fair and just procedure that leads to a fair and
                            just result. This is not merely abstract theorising. It is the <em>very basis</em> of what the courts do – and
                            ought to do. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    It is true, however, that in the sphere of practical
                            reality, there is often a <em>tension</em> between
                            the need for procedural justice on the one hand and substantive justice
                            on the other. The task of the court is to attempt, as I have pointed out
                            in the preceding paragraph, to resolve this tension. There is a further
                            task: it is to actually attempt, simultaneously, to integrate these two
                            conceptions of justice in order that justice in its fullest orb may
                            shine forth.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     A general test which is often employed to
                    address this tension between ensuring compliance with procedural requirements
                    and ensuring that substantive justice is done is the test of prejudice. Thus, in
                        <em>The “Tokai Maru”</em> [1998]
                    2 SLR(R) 646 (“<em>The Tokai
                    Maru</em>”), this court held at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and
                            litigants towards the just resolution of the case and should of course
                            be adhered to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not be deprived of his
                            opportunity to dispute the plaintiff’s claims and have a
                            determination of the issues on the merits as a punishment for a breach
                            of these rules <em>unless the other party has been made
                                to suffer prejudice which cannot be compensated for by an
                                appropriate order as to costs</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Save in special cases or exceptional
                            circumstances, it can rarely be appropriate then, on an overall
                            assessment of what justice requires, to deny a defendant an extension of
                            time where the denial would have the effect of depriving him of his
                            defence because of a procedural default which, even if unjustified, has
                            caused the plaintiff no prejudice for which he cannot be compensated by
                            an award of costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Similarly, in <em>Chan</em> at [25], this court, citing the decision in <em>The Tokai Maru</em>, held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [E]xtensions pertaining to matters that touch upon the
                        substantive merits of a party’s case (and where [the application] does

                        generally be granted <em>unless the other party would suffer
                            prejudice that could not be compensated by costs</em> …

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     At this juncture, we ought to refer to another
                    provision in the Rules of Court which is pertinent to the issue of whether the
                    timeline for filing the Stay Application should be extended. This is O 3
                    r 4, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>4</b>.—(1) The Court may, on such
                        terms as it thinks just, by order extend or abridge the period within which
                        a person is required or authorised by these Rules or by any judgment, order
                        or direction, to do any act in any proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The Court may extend any such period as is
                            referred to in paragraph (1) although the application for extension
                            is not made until after the expiration of that period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Order 3 r 4 is relevant in this appeal because, as
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above, in the Stay
                    Application, the Respondent, apart from seeking a stay of the Singapore Action,
                    also asked for an extension of time to file that application. We should also add
                    that under para 7 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature
                    Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), the High Court is conferred
                    “[p]ower to enlarge or abridge the time prescribed by any written law for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Like O 2 r 1(2) of the Rules of
                    Court, O 3 rr 4(1) and 4(2) do not spell out how the court’s
                    discretion to extend or abridge time should be exercised, although O 3
                    r 4(1) does state that the discretion should be exercised “on such
                    terms as [the court] thinks just”. As is to be expected, case law also
                    does not provide definitive guidance as to how this discretionary power ought to
                    be exercised, although broad considerations can be gleaned from the authorities.
                    Much would depend on the circumstances of each case. Obviously, a consideration
                    which is materially significant in one set of circumstances may not necessarily
                    have the same significant effect in a different set of circumstances. In some
                    cases, the courts have made judicial pronouncements which appear to be
                    relatively liberal, such as the statement by Mustill LJ in <em>Erskine Communications Ltd and Another v Worthington and
                        Others</em> [1991] TLR 330 (at 330 itself) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t would be absurd to say that every instance of overstepping
                        the time limit without excuse, however short and however lacking in harmful
                        consequence to the defendant, should be punished by the loss of the
                        action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other cases, the courts appear to have taken a stricter approach.
                    For instance, in <em>Thamboo Ratnam v Thamboo Cumarasamy and
                        Cumarasamy Ariamany d/o Kumarasa</em> [1965] 1 WLR 8, the
                    Privy Council stated at 12:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed, and in order to justify a
                        court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to
                        be taken there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its
                        discretion. If the law were otherwise, a party in breach would have an
                        unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of
                        the rules, which is to provide a time table [<em>sic</em>] for the conduct of litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Costellow v Somerset
                        County Council</em> [1993] 1 WLR 256, Sir Thomas
                    Bingham MR laid stress on the importance of the question of prejudice and
                    held that it was the “overall assessment of what justice
                    require[d]” (at 264) which really mattered. A similar approach was taken
                    by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Finnegan v Parkside Health
                        Authority</em> [1998] 1 WLR 411. In that case, the plaintiff
                    applied to the English High Court for an extension of time to file an appeal
                    against an order of the master striking out her action for want of prosecution.
                    The judge hearing the application (“the English High Court
                    judge”), who did not think he needed to consider the question of
                    prejudice, refused to grant the plaintiff the extension sought. On appeal by the
                    plaintiff, the English Court of Appeal, taking the view that the question of
                    prejudice was of importance and bearing in mind the overriding principle that
                    justice had to be done, remitted the case back to the English High Court judge
                    for further consideration, with a specific direction to look into the question
                    of prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Another instructive case is <em>Mortgage Corporation Ltd v Sandoes and Others</em>
                    [1996] TLR 751 (“<em>Mortgage
                        Corporation</em>”), where the plaintiff sought, but was denied,
                    an extension of time for the exchange of witness statements and expert reports.
                    On appeal, the English Court of Appeal said that the correct approach to take
                    was that once a party was in default in complying with a prescribed timeline, it
                    was for that party to satisfy the court that despite its default, the
                    court’s discretion to extend time should nevertheless be exercised in its
                    favour; in this connection, the party in default could rely on any relevant
                    circumstances. Millett LJ, in delivering the judgment of the English Court
                    of Appeal, said at 752:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court was acutely aware of the growing jurisprudence in relation to
                        the failure to observe procedural requirements. There was a need for
                        clarification as to the likely approach of the court in the future to
                        non-compliance with the requirements as to time contained in the rules or
                        directions of the court. What [the court] said now went beyond the exchange
                        of witness statements or expert reports; it was intended to be of general
                        import.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls and Sir Richard
                        Scott, Vice-Chancellor, had approved the following guidance as to the future
                        approach which litigants could expect the court to adopt to the failure to
                        adhere to time limits contained in the rules or directions of the
                        court:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">1    Time requirements laid down by the rules and
                                directions given by the court were not merely targets to be
                                attempted; they were rules to be observed.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">2    At the same time the overriding principle was
                                that justice must be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3    Litigants were entitled to have their cases
                                resolved with reasonable expedition. The non-compliance with time
                                limits could cause prejudice to one or more of the parties to the
                                litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">4    In addition the vacation or adjournment of the
                                date of trial prejudiced other litigants and disrupted the
                                administration of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">5    Extensions of time which involved the vacation
                                or adjournment of trial dates should therefore be granted only as a
                                last resort.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">6    Where time limits had not been complied with the
                                parties should cooperate in reaching an agreement as to new time
                                limits which would not involve the date of trial being
                                postponed.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7    If they reached such an agreement they could
                                ordinarily expect the court to give effect to that agreement at the
                                trial and it was not necessary to make a separate application solely
                                for that purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">8    The court would not look with favour on a party
                                who sought only to take tactical advantage [of] the failure of
                                another party to comply with time limits.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">9    In the absence of an agreement as to a new
                                timetable, an application should be made promptly to the court for
                                directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10    In considering whether to grant an extension of
                                time to a party who was in default, the court would look at all the
                                circumstances of the case including the considerations identified
                                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Our local cases appear to draw a distinction
                    between an application (made after a trial) for an extension of time to file a
                    notice of appeal and an application for an extension of time for other purposes,
                    with the courts taking a stricter view <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the former type of application. This distinction seems to have been recognised
                    in <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em>, where this court said at
                    [33]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear … that <b><em>the courts will
                            adopt a far stricter approach towards applications for extension of time
                            for the filing and/or serving of a notice of appeal relative to other
                            situations</em></b>. This is not without good reason. The overriding
                        concern in the context of <em>appeals</em> is that
                        there be <em>finality</em>. Indeed, the one-month
                        deadline for the filing of a notice of appeal is not an arbitrary one.
                        Underlying the concern with finality is the fundamental rationale of
                            <em>justice and fairness</em>. The decision
                        concerned has, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, gone against the
                        losing party (<em>ie</em>, the would-be appellant), and
                        the onus is therefore on it to file an appeal if it feels that the decision
                        is wrong. Correspondingly, the other party (the would-be respondent), having
                        had the decision handed down in its favour, should not be kept waiting
                        – at least, not indefinitely – on tenterhooks to receive the
                        fruits of its judgment. For better or for worse, the applicant must decide
                        whether or not it wishes to appeal. As this court observed in <em>Ong Cheng Aik</em> [<em>v Dayco Products
                            Singapore Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</em> [2005]
                        2 SLR(R) 561] at [8]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In respect of such an application for extension of time [to file or
                            serve a notice of appeal out of time], the court takes a rather strict
                            view of things and sufficient grounds must be shown before the court
                            will exercise its discretion. This is because if no appeal is filed and
                            served within the prescribed time of one month, the successful party is
                            justly entitled to assume and act as if the judgment is final.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The factors which our courts have regard to in
                    determining whether an extension of time to file a notice of appeal should be
                    granted are fourfold, namely: (a) the length of the delay; (b) the
                    reasons for the delay; (c) the chances of the defaulting party (<em>ie</em>, the would-be appellant) succeeding on appeal if the
                    time for appealing were extended; and (d) the degree of prejudice to the
                    would-be respondent if the extension of time were granted (see, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Hau Khee Wee and another
                        v Chua Kian Tong and another</em>
                    [1985–1986] SLR(R) 1075 at [14], <em>Pearson
                        Judith Rosemary v Chen Chien Wen Edwin</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 260 at [15], <em>AD v AE</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR(R) 505 at [10], <em>Lee Hsien Loong</em> at
                    [18] and <em>Anwar Siraj and another v Ting Kang Chung
                        John</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1026 at [29]). It should, however, be
                    noted that these factors have also been applied in some cases which did not
                    concern an application for leave to file an appeal out of time (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v
                        Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 121,
                    which pertained to the late filing of a proof of debt under a scheme of
                    arrangement for a company).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In our view, what the aforesaid authorities
                    show is that in each case, the court, in deciding whether to extend the
                    prescribed timeline for an act to be done, has to balance the competing
                    interests of the parties concerned. As the statement of Millett LJ in
                        <em>Mortgage Corporation</em> (quoted above at
                        <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>) shows, the factual matrix of the
                    particular case at hand will be paramount. In balancing the parties’
                    competing interests, the court inevitably needs to consider the question of
                    prejudice. Copious citation of case law will not be necessary (and also will not
                    be helpful) as previous decisions will be no more than guides. In determining
                    how the balance of interests should be struck and in applying the four factors
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above, it is the overall
                    picture that emerges to the court as to where the justice of the case lies which
                    will ultimately be decisive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s reservations about <em>Chan</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Before we go on to apply the principles
                    outlined above to the facts of the present case, we wish to address the
                    Judge’s reservations about this court’s decision in <em>Chan</em>. In <em>Chan</em>, the
                    defendants – like the Respondent – applied late for a stay of
                    proceedings and did so only <em>after</em> they had filed
                    their defence. Because of this factual similarity between the instant case and
                        <em>Chan</em>, the Judge felt constrained to apply the
                    test of prejudice in <em>Chan</em> to the
                    Respondent’s benefit (see the GD at [11]; see also <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, as alluded to at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, the Judge also expressed reservations
                    about the decision in <em>Chan</em> (see the GD at
                    [12]–[19]). In particular, the Judge seemed to be of the view that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     the decision in <em>Chan</em> was open to question because this court had referred to
                            <em>The Tokai Maru</em>, which involved factual
                        circumstances that were significantly dissimilar to those found in <em>Chan</em> (referred to hereafter as “the
                        Judge’s first reservation about <em>Chan</em>”) (see the GD at [12]–[13]);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     the test of
                        prejudice adopted in <em>Chan</em> was unsatisfactory
                        because it might lead to unsatisfactory results in the context of stay
                        applications (referred to hereafter as “the Judge’s second
                        reservation about <em>Chan</em>”) (see the GD at
                        [15] and [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On the face of it, it seems to us that the
                    Judge expressed reservations about the decision in <em>Chan</em> because there appeared (in his view) to be some
                    incongruence between where the equities of the present case lay and the legal
                    result that would follow by applying <em>Chan</em>. It
                    appears that the Judge would not have exercised his discretion to extend time to
                    enable the Respondent to make the Stay Application but for the principle
                    enunciated in <em>Chan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    Judge’s first reservation about <em>Chan</em>, the
                    Judge appeared to have understood the rationale of the test of prejudice as
                    being <em>only</em> to prevent a defaulting party from
                    being deprived of the opportunity to <em>present its
                        case</em> to the court on the merits. Accordingly, the Judge found it
                    appropriate to draw a distinction between the instant case and <em>The Tokai Maru</em> by stating in the GD that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    ... [<em>The</em>] <em>Tokai Maru</em> was not a case in which a defendant
                            had filed his stay application late. In that case, the party was filing
                            an affidavit of evidence-in-chief late and the court was loath to
                            preclude that party from <b><em>presenting its
                                case</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    In resisting an application for a stay of
                            proceedings, a plaintiff is not seeking to preclude a defendant from
                                <b><em>presenting his case</em></b>. On the contrary,
                            the plaintiff is suggesting that the defendant should do so but that he
                            should do so <em>in Singapore</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     With respect, we do not think that the test of
                    prejudice adopted in <em>Chan</em> should be so narrowly
                    confined, <em>ie</em>, as being applicable only to a
                    situation where a defaulting party would be prevented from presenting its case
                    to the court on the merits if an extension of time were not granted. There is no
                    reason why the test of prejudice cannot apply in other circumstances (<em>eg</em>, where the court is confronted with the question of
                    whether it should exercise its discretion to extend time to enable an act to be
                    carried out under the Rules of Court). The need for a party to present its case
                    to the court on the merits is not the <em>sole</em> sort of
                    circumstance which the test of prejudice can usefully address. In <em>Mortgage Corporation</em> (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above), for instance, the English Court of Appeal held that
                    the question of prejudice was a relevant consideration in determining whether an
                    extension of time for the exchange of witness statements and expert reports
                    should be granted. We should also underscore that in the passage from
                    Millett LJ’s judgment in <em>Mortgage
                        Corporation</em> at 752 (quoted at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above), it was expressly stated that the guidelines set out
                    therein were intended to be of general application and were not limited to the
                    specific situation which arose in that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is true that in <em>Chan</em>, this court stated at [25] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t bears noting what this court said in <em>The Tokai Maru</em> … at [23], [<em>ie</em>,] that extensions [of time] pertaining to matters that
                        touch upon the substantive merits of a party’s case (and where [the
                        application] does not relate to the filing of [a] notice of appeal out of
                        time) should generally be granted unless the other party would suffer
                        prejudice that could not be compensated by costs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and litigants
                            towards the just resolution of the case and should of course be adhered
                            to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not be deprived of his opportunity to
                            dispute the plaintiff’s claims and have a determination of the
                            issues on the merits as a punishment for a breach of these rules unless
                            the other party has been made to suffer prejudice which cannot be
                            compensated for by an appropriate order as to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…

                                time</em> where the denial would have the effect of depriving
                            him of his defence <em>because of a procedural default

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On a plain reading of the above quotation, it
                    seems clear that in <em>Chan</em>, this court was doing no
                    more than merely citing <em>The Tokai Maru</em> as
                        <em>one instance</em> where the test of prejudice was
                    applied, and was <em>not</em> intending in any way
                        <em>to limit</em> the remit of the application of this
                    test. From the above quotation, it is also clear that in <em>Chan</em>, this court was well aware that the circumstances in
                        <em>The Tokai Maru</em> (which concerned an application
                    to file an affidavit of evidence-in-chief – a document that
                    “touch[es] upon the substantive merits of a party’s case”
                        (<em>per</em> [25] of <em>Chan</em>) – out of time) were different from those in
                        <em>Chan</em> (which concerned a late attempt by the
                    defendants, via a stay application filed out of time, to contend that Malaysia,
                    and not Singapore, was the appropriate forum to try the plaintiff’s
                    defamation action against them).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We now turn to the Judge’s second
                    reservation about <em>Chan</em>, which centred on the
                    Judge’s concern that the test of prejudice could lead to unsatisfactory
                    results in the context of stay applications. In particular, the Judge was of the
                    view that under the test of prejudice, a defendant could effectively make a
                    plaintiff endure copious interlocutory applications after the defence was filed
                    and yet still escape the fate of being precluded from applying for a stay of
                    proceedings out of time as the test of prejudice “place[d] an unfair
                    burden on the plaintiff to show good reasons why [the] defendant should not be
                    allowed to make his application for a stay late” (see the GD at [16]; see
                    also [15] and [19] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     While we understand these concerns of the
                    Judge, it is, with respect, <em>not</em> entirely correct
                    to say that the test of prejudice has the effect of enabling a defendant to make
                    copious interlocutory applications after filing its defence whilst still
                    remaining at liberty to make a stay application out of time. The law certainly
                    would not grant a defendant <em>carte blanche</em> to make
                    copious interlocutory applications with impunity (<em>a
                        fortiori</em>, as we note at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>
                    below, where such applications are made in bad faith). In this regard, we note
                    the following observations of Bowen LJ in <em>Cropper v
                        Smith</em> (1884) 26 Ch D 700 at 710 (referred to in
                        <em>The Tokai Maru</em> at [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I think it is a well established principle that the object of
                        [the] Courts is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punish them
                        for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise
                        than in accordance with their rights. ... <em>I know of no
                            kind of error or mistake which</em>, <b><em>if not
                            fraudulent or intended to overreach</em></b><em>, the
                            Court ought not to correct, if it can be done without injustice to the
                            other party</em>. Courts do not exist for the sake of discipline,
                        but for the sake of deciding matters in controversy … [emphasis added
                        in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We do not wish to venture into the realm of
                    speculation, but, obviously, the more interlocutory applications or steps a
                    defendant makes or takes before it files a stay application, and/or the longer
                    it delays in making its stay application, the court would undoubtedly take those
                    circumstances into account in determining whether or not to grant the defendant
                    an extension of time to apply for a stay. The court is not without the necessary
                    procedural armoury (which includes the making of an appropriate costs order) to
                    prevent any abuse of its process. Further, the court would be entitled to hold
                    that procedural irregularities motivated by bad faith or by a deliberate
                    intention to overreach on the part of the defaulting party are
                    irremediable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As regards the Judge’s point that the
                    test of prejudice seems to favour the defendant as it apparently places the
                    burden on the plaintiff to show that it (the plaintiff) has suffered prejudice
                    which cannot be compensated by costs (in this connection, the Judge even
                    suggested that the burden of proof under the test of prejudice should be
                    reversed, with the defendant having to adduce good reasons to show why it should
                    be allowed to make its stay application out of time (see the GD at [16])), we
                    think this advantage is more apparent than real. The test of prejudice must
                    ultimately be applied in the light of all the relevant circumstances of the case
                    at hand. It goes without saying that an applicant for an extension of time has
                    the initial burden of showing facts which warrant the court exercising its
                    discretion in the applicant’s favour. But, the burden of proof on any
                    particular issue at any particular point in time is not static. In particular,
                    the evidential burden would shift, depending on how the application for an
                    extension of time progresses. In our view, unless there are other more weighty
                    considerations, the determination by the court on the question of prejudice
                    could very well be decisive as to how it views where the justice of the case
                    lies and, in turn, how it decides to exercise its discretion to extend
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In this connection, we ought to clarify that
                    in <em>Chan</em>, the position taken by the plaintiff
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the defendants’ application
                    for a stay of proceedings was that the timeline prescribed in O 12
                    r 7(2) of the Rules of Court for filing a stay application was absolute and
                    the court had no discretion whatsoever to extend that timeline. In the absence
                    of any other ground advanced by the plaintiff, this court quite naturally
                    considered, in the main, only the question of prejudice in deciding whether to
                    grant the defendants an extension of time to file their stay application. This
                    court did <em>not</em> state in <em>Chan</em> that prejudice was the <em>only</em>
                    matter which the court needed to take into account when considering an
                    application for an extension of time. The court’s consideration of
                    prejudice in <em>Chan</em> must be viewed in the context of
                    the grounds raised by the parties there. In any event, this court in <em>Chan</em> clearly also took into account other circumstances,
                    such as the close link between the plaintiff’s action in Singapore against
                    the defendants for defamation (“the Singapore defamation action”)
                    and the plaintiff’s actions in Malaysia against the defendants as trustees
                    of an estate (“the Malaysian trusteeship actions”) as well as the
                    desirability of avoiding inconsistent findings in those two sets of proceedings
                    (see <em>Chan</em> at [26]). Lastly, there is one other
                    circumstance in <em>Chan</em> which warrants highlighting.
                    This relates to the fact that the stay granted in <em>Chan</em> was a limited one, <em>ie</em>, the
                    Singapore defamation action was stayed only to the limited extent that it was to
                    be heard in <em>Singapore</em> after the conclusion of the
                    Malaysian trusteeship actions (see <em>Chan</em> at [47]).
                    The stay order in <em>Chan</em> was not the normal
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em> stay order, which would
                    have been an order staying the Singapore defamation action so that a fresh
                    defamation suit could be commenced in <em>Malaysia</em> and
                    be heard together with the Malaysian trusteeship actions, which were then
                    pending.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our ruling on extension of time for filing the Stay
                Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     We now turn to consider whether, applying the
                    principles discussed at [20]–[30] above to the circumstances of this case,
                    this court should grant the Respondent an extension of time to file the Stay
                    Application notwithstanding that, besides being late in filing that application,
                    the Respondent has also filed his defence to the Singapore Action. The Judge
                    thought that the whole state of affairs was brought about by the mistake of the
                    Respondent’s solicitors. This was what he stated at [18] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appeared to me that the reality was that [the Respondent’s]
                        solicitors did not realise that that the [S]tay [A]pplication had to be
                        filed as soon as possible and before filing the defence. Had they realised
                        this and if there were genuine reasons why they could not do so promptly,
                        then they should have applied for an extension of time to file the [S]tay
                        [A]pplication as well as [for an order] to defer the filing of the defence
                        pending the outcome of the [S]tay [A]pplication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We are inclined to agree with this finding of
                    the Judge as there is nothing to suggest that the Respondent’s lateness in
                    filing the Stay Application was brought about by any bad faith or by any
                    intention on the Respondent’s part to overreach. It seems to us that this
                    was a case of either oversight or unfamiliarity with the Rules of Court on the
                    part of the Respondent’s solicitors. While this court does not condone
                    such mistakes, the question that remains, ultimately, is this: is the
                    Respondent’s procedural default so egregious that the imposition of a
                    sanction by way of an appropriate costs order would not suffice to register the
                    court’s disapproval? We do not think so. The position taken by the
                    Appellant is that the Respondent, by filing his defence to the Singapore Action,
                    has accepted the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, and that is fatal to the
                    Stay Application. We do not think the filing of the Respondent’s defence
                        <em>per se</em> necessarily leads to this outcome. Work
                    done by the Appellant’s solicitors following the filing of the
                    Respondent’s defence can be adequately compensated by costs. It is also
                    pertinent to note that in a letter written by the Respondent’s solicitors
                    on 4 June 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> (<em>ie</em>, one
                    day prior to the mutually-agreed extended deadline of 5 June 2009 for the
                    filing of the Respondent’s defence), the Respondent’s solicitors
                    asked the Appellant’s solicitors to allow the Respondent to defer filing
                    his defence, stating that the Respondent would be making a stay application on
                    the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. Apparently,
                    for various reasons (<em>eg</em>, the efforts of the
                    Respondent’s solicitors to get a copy of the Maldivian judgment obtained
                    by Shahid against SJM (<em>ie</em>, the Maldivian judgment
                    referred to at sub-para (a) of <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    above) and the wait for a legal opinion from the Maldives as to whether or not
                    the Appellant’s claims against the Respondent could be pursued
                        there),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> the
                    Respondent did not feel able then to apply for a stay of the Singapore
                    Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Without going into the question of whether
                    these reasons were adequate to justify the Respondent’s decision not to
                    file the Stay Application within the prescribed timeline, the fact is that the
                    Stay Application was not an afterthought. Admittedly, the apparent difficulty
                    encountered by the Respondent in complying with the timeline for applying for a
                    stay of the Singapore Action could have been easily overcome by his making an
                    express reservation when filing his defence to that action. This was not done
                    (due, perhaps, to an insufficient understanding of the Rules of Court on the
                    part of the Respondent’s solicitors). On 23 June 2009, the
                    Respondent’s solicitors again wrote to the Appellant’s
                        solicitors,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> reiterating (among other things)
                    the Respondent’s intention to apply for a stay of the Singapore Action and
                    the fact that they (the Respondent’s solicitors) were waiting for certain
                    documents (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above). While the delay
                    here involved a period of approximately one month and three weeks, it bears
                    emphasis that the Stay Application is an interlocutory matter which does not
                    involve the filing of a notice of appeal out of time. Moreover, the Stay
                    Application cannot be regarded as without merit (see the GD at [25]–[52]
                    and the discussion below at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>–<a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>). In the
                    circumstances, we do not think that the Judge’s decision to grant the
                    Respondent an extension of time to file the Stay Application can be regarded as
                    plainly without any basis and plainly wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Waiver</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Before we move on to consider the Second
                    Issue, we note, in passing, that the question of whether the Respondent could be
                    taken, by virtue of his lateness in applying for a stay of the Singapore Action,
                    to have waived his right to make such an application was not dealt with in the
                    court below, nor was it raised by the parties in their submissions in this
                    appeal. All that we wish to say in this regard is that in the commentary on
                    O 12 r 7 of the Rules of Court in <em>Pinsler
                        2009</em> at para 12/7/6, it is stated that “[a] lengthy
                    delay in making [a stay] application (ie beyond the time limit for serving a
                    defence) may be treated as a waiver of any objections which might have been
                    raised”. As no submission was made by the parties as to whether the
                    principle of waiver was applicable in the present case and, if so, how that
                    principle should be applied, we will make no further comment on this
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Second Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     We now turn to the Second Issue, namely,
                    whether a stay of the Singapore Action on the ground of <em>forum
                        non conveniens</em> is justified. To determine which is the most
                    appropriate forum for trial as between two or more available fora, the court has
                    to decide which forum the dispute has the most real and substantial connection
                    with. On this issue, the leading authority is <em>Spiliada</em>. The <em>Spiliada</em> test, which
                    (as can be seen from <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> and <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) is a two-stage test, has become the
                    established test in Singapore, having been accepted in numerous previous cases
                    in our courts, the more recent ones being <em>PT Hutan Domas Raya
                        v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd and another</em> [2001]
                    1 SLR(R) 104, <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another
                        v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377,
                        <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 543 (“<em>CIMB
                    Bank</em>”), <em>Goh Suan Hee v Teo Cher
                        Teck</em> [2010] 1 SLR 367 and <em>JIO Minerals

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s decision on the Second Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the court below, the Judge quite rightly
                    applied the <em>Spiliada</em> test in deciding the Second
                    Issue. Having weighed the various relevant connecting factors, he came to the
                    conclusion that the Maldives would be the more appropriate forum for the trial
                    of the Dispute. The connecting factors which he considered are tabulated

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the basis of the above table, it is easy to

                    the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, and also

                    Action should not be granted despite the Maldives being the more appropriate
                    forum. We now examine whether the Judge was right to come to this
                    conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evaluation of the Judge’s exercise of discretion under the
                    <em>Spiliada</em> test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It is settled law that in deciding whether or
                    not to stay an action on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>, a judge is exercising his discretion, and this court,
                    in hearing an appeal against such a decision, should only review that decision
                    and should not exercise an independent discretion. As this court stated in
                        <em>Chan</em> at [28]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [A]s the question of whether or not to grant a stay of proceedings
                        involves an exercise of a judge’s discretion, the appellate court will
                        only review the [j]udge’s exercise of his discretion. It will not
                        exercise the discretion afresh and substitute its own discretion in place of
                        [the discretion of] the court below …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Similarly, in the earlier case of <em>CIMB Bank</em>, this court held at [84]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear that in determining whether or not to grant a stay of
                        proceedings, the judge will be exercising a discretion. Such an exercise of
                        discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate court <em>unless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of
                            principle, or … had taken into account matters which he ought not
                            to have taken into account or had failed to take into account matters
                            which he ought to have taken into account, or [unless] his decision
                            [was] plainly wrong</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In his submissions, counsel for the Respondent
                    cited the decision of the House of Lords in <em>Shiloh Spinners
                        Ltd v Harding</em> [1973] AC 691 and the local case of <em>QBE Insurance Ltd v Sim Lim Finance Ltd</em>
                    [1987] SLR(R) 23 (“<em>QBE
                    Insurance</em>”). These two cases set out substantially the same
                    proposition of law as that enunciated at [28] of <em>Chan</em> and [84] of <em>CIMB Bank</em>, save
                    that <em>QBE Insurance</em> laid down (at [36]) an
                    additional ground for an appellate court to interfere with a lower court’s
                    exercise of discretion as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The function of an appellate court in hearing an appeal against an
                        interlocutory order is primarily a reviewing function and the court should
                        reverse a decision ... [<em>inter alia</em>] in order
                        to promote consistency in the exercise of … discretion by the judges
                        as a whole where there appear, in closely comparable circumstances, to be
                        two conflicting schools of judicial opinion as to the relative weight to be
                        given to particular considerations …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the Respondent is not saying that there are “in closely
                    comparable circumstances, … two conflicting schools of judicial opinion
                    as to the relative weight to be given to particular considerations”

                        Insurance</em>) in the present case, nothing in this appeal turns on
                    this additional ground for interfering with a lower court’s exercise of
                    discretion and we need make no further comment on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first stage of the <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">Spiliada</span>
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Availability of allegedly material witnesses in the
                Maldives</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In respect of the Judge’s exercise of
                    discretion under the first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em>
                    test, the Appellant’s strongest point, in our view, is the argument (based
                    on the decision in <em>Mineral Enterprises Ltd v JIO Minerals FZC
                        and others</em> [2010] SGHC 109) that in deciding a stay application,
                    the court “[can]not simply weigh the connecting factors without reference
                    to the likely issues”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    Two connecting factors have been singled out by the Appellant in this regard,
                    namely, the availability of allegedly material witnesses in the Maldives and the
                    governing law of the Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    first of the aforesaid connecting factors, the Appellant argues that
                    “[t]he crux of [its] case concerns the authority of the Respondent and
                    that is a matter between the [Appellant] and the Respondent
                        alone”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> According to the Appellant,
                    the question of what authority the Respondent actually possessed at the material
                    time is solely “a matter within the knowledge of the parties [<em>ie</em>, the Appellant and the
                        Respondent]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in bold in
                    original omitted]. Thus, the Appellant claims, the Judge should not have taken
                    into account the fact that there are witnesses in the Maldives (<em>ie</em>, Shahid and Gahir) who are allegedly material
                    witnesses. Indeed, the Appellant asserts that these Maldivian witnesses are
                    wholly unnecessary for the purposes of resolving the Dispute. Accordingly, it
                    submits that the availability of allegedly material witnesses in the Maldives
                    should carry little weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As we see it, this argument is valid only if
                    it is viewed solely from the viewpoint of the Appellant’s pleaded case.
                    That, of course, would be too narrow a perspective. The Respondent’s
                    defence to the Appellant’s claim for US$175,000 (see sub-para (a) of
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) is that following a
                    negotiation between Seung and Shahid, where the Respondent was present, Seung
                    agreed to pay US$175,000 to Shahid for the latter’s services. As for the
                    Appellant’s claim for US$101,982.37 (see sub-para (b) of <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), the Respondent’s position is that
                    the payment of this sum to Son was agreed on at a discussion between Seung and
                    the Respondent, where Shahid and Gahir were present. In the light of this
                    defence, the evidence of Shahid and Gahir becomes very important. The issue of
                    the scope of the Respondent’s authority cannot be regarded as just an
                    internal matter between the Appellant and the Respondent. Shahid can provide
                    evidence on the services that he rendered to SJM, which evidence might show that
                    the payment of US$175,000 to him was justified. Shahid can also testify on how
                    the letter of 27 August 2007 from the Respondent (written on behalf of SJM)
                    to him confirming payment of US$175,000 for “services …
                        received”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> came into being. Further,
                    Shahid and Gahir can provide evidence on Seung’s alleged agreement with
                    the Respondent to pay Son the sum of US$101,982.37. We also note that although
                    Gahir is apparently the brother-in-law of Shahid, the Judge found no reason to
                    suspect that these two Maldivian witnesses were contrived by the Respondent to
                    support the Stay Application (see the GD at [38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The fact that an important witness is only
                    available and compellable in a particular jurisdiction is a significant
                    consideration which can tilt the balance in favour of that jurisdiction (see
                        <em>Peters Roger May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</em>
                    [2006] 2 SLR(R) 381). In this regard, the Respondent’s Maldivian
                    law expert said that witnesses in the Maldives were compellable to testify in a
                    civil action there, whereas the Appellant’s Maldivian law expert appeared
                    to take the view that witnesses in the Maldives were not thus compellable. The
                    Appellant’s Maldivian law expert added, however, that the Maldivian courts
                    could assist in the taking of evidence (via video link) of <em>willing</em> witnesses in the Maldives for use in foreign proceedings
                    (see the GD at [39]). It is unclear whether a witness in the Maldives who is
                        <em>unwilling</em> to testify in a foreign action can
                    be compelled to give evidence by video link for the purposes of the foreign
                    action. Even assuming that there are no legal provisions in the Maldives to that
                    effect and also no legal provisions to compel an unwilling witness to testify in
                    a civil matter instituted in the Maldivian courts, presumably, greater pressure
                    can be brought to bear on such a witness to testify if his evidence is required
                    in relation to an action in the Maldives as opposed to a foreign action. To that
                    extent, the availability of allegedly material witnesses in the Maldives favours
                    that jurisdiction as the more appropriate forum for the trial of the
                    Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Governing law of the Dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     We now turn to the second connecting factor
                    singled out by the Appellant before this court, <em>viz</em>, the governing law of the Dispute. That the governing law of
                    a dispute is a relevant factor in determining which jurisdiction the dispute has
                    the closest connection with was reiterated and explained by this court in
                        <em>CIMB Bank</em> at [63] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason why, in the consideration of the question of forum non
                        conveniens, the issue of applicable law [<em>ie</em>,
                        governing law] is a relevant factor is because where a dispute is governed
                        by a foreign law, <em>the forum will be less adept in
                            applying that law than the courts of the country of that law, and there
                            could be savings in time and resources in litigating the dispute in the
                            forum of the applicable law</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Appellant submits that the governing law
                    of the Dispute (which basically centres on the issue of the Respondent’s
                    authority and the issue of whether the Respondent committed the tort of
                    conspiracy against the Appellant)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>
                    is a neutral connecting factor because, in so far as these two issues are
                    concerned, there is no difference between the <em>content</em> of Singapore law and that of Maldivian law.
                    Specifically, the Appellant contends that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]hether or not the Respondent acted in breach of his authority,
                        the law would remain the same, whether in Singapore or in the Maldives
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The wrong would remain a wrong, whether in the Maldives or in
                        Singapore. As such, the Judge’s view subscribing to the applicability
                        of Maldivian law as the governing law is incorrect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In <em>Dicey, Morris and
                        Collins on The Conflict of Laws</em> (Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) (“<em>Dicey</em>”) at vol 1, para 12-029, the following
                    proposition is stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the legal issues are straightforward, or <em>if the
                            competing fora have domestic laws which are substantially
                            similar</em>, the identity of the governing law will be a factor
                        of rather little significance. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This proposition was cited with approval by this court in <em>CIMB Bank</em> at [61].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the present case, there is no doubt that
                    the Respondent’s alleged breaches of the Employment Contract occurred in
                    the Maldives. Also, the alleged tort of conspiracy was committed there. Clearly,
                    the alleged breaches of contract as well as the alleged tort of conspiracy would
                    be governed by the law of the Maldives. In our view, the Appellant has failed to
                    show that Maldivian law on breach of contract and the tort of conspiracy is the
                    same as the corresponding areas of Singapore law. The Applicant has consequently
                    failed to show that the circumstances of the present case warrant the
                    application of the proposition expounded at vol 1, para 12-029 of
                        <em>Dicey</em>. It must be borne in mind that in
                        <em>CIMB Bank</em>, this court held that the governing
                    law was not a factor of much significance because the court accepted that the
                    Singapore courts would be able to apply the competing forum’s law (if it
                    were indeed the relevant governing law) “without the aid of foreign
                    experts” (at [63]) since that law was English law. In contrast, it is
                    highly questionable whether the same can be said in the present case, given that
                    there already seems to be a sharp divergence of opinion between the respective
                    parties’ expert witnesses on several aspects of Maldivian law and the
                    Maldivian legal system even at this interlocutory stage (see the GD at [39] and
                    [44]). Hence, it cannot be said that the Singapore courts would be able (if the
                    Singapore Action were allowed to proceed here) to apply Maldivian law without
                    the aid of any experts on that system of law. On this factor, we agree with the
                    Judge that the governing law of the Dispute also favours the Maldives as the
                    more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In the result, under the first stage of the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> test, we affirm the Judge’s
                    finding that the connecting factors show that the Maldives would be the more
                    appropriate forum for the trial of the Dispute. The one single link which the
                    Dispute has with Singapore, as far as we can see, is the fact that the
                    Respondent was apparently employed by the Appellant – a Singapore company
                    – and seconded by it to work for SJM in the Maldives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second stage of the <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">Spiliada</span>
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Turning to the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the Appellant alludes to the fact that in
                    the Maldivian profit suit mentioned at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above, which has already been concluded, the Civil Court of the Maldives, in
                    holding that the Respondent’s employer was SJM and not the Appellant,
                    considered documents issued in the Maldives to the exclusion of documents issued
                    in Singapore (see the GD at [31]). In view of this, the Appellant argues that
                    substantial justice cannot be done if it is compelled to initiate proceedings
                    against the Respondent in the Maldives because the Maldivian courts are likely
                    to adopt the same approach as that taken in the Maldivian profit
                suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     With respect, the Appellant, in raising this
                    argument, is traversing old grounds which have already been sufficiently dealt
                    with by the Judge. Suffice it to restate that the Judge held that there would be
                    no unfair prejudice to the Appellant if it were to litigate the Dispute in the
                    Maldives since “[the Appellant] was not yet a party to proceedings in the
                    Maldives and it would be open to another Maldivian court to take a different
                    view [on the identity of the Respondent’s employer]” (see the GD at
                    [48]). Both of the Maldivian law experts called by the Appellant have not
                    expressed any views to the contrary. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest
                    that the Appellant cannot tender the documents issued in Singapore in
                    proceedings before the Maldivian courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In the circumstances, we hold that the Judge
                    is correct in concluding, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the second
                    stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, that the Appellant has
                    not shown that there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that
                    a stay of the Singapore Action be denied even though the application of the
                    first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test points to the
                    Maldives as the more appropriate forum for the trial of the
                Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the
                    Judge’s decision to order a stay of the Singapore Action on the ground of
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em>. Accordingly, we dismiss
                    the present appeal with costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
