</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 This discrepancy arises because over the course of their relationship, the plaintiff and defendant developed a practice of issuing invoices/credit notes to the other party in respect of various debts owed and agreed to a “contra arrangement” where they would set-off their debts owed to each other as opposed to paying each other directly. Unfortunately, the parties could not agree on the debts, and their respective invoices/credit notes reflected their difference in opinion on the correct amount that was owed. This disagreement stems partly from a disagreement as to liability for the debts and partly as to the quantification of the debts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 As a result, a significant portion of the trial focused on whether certain debts were correctly represented in individual invoices/credit notes issued by either the plaintiff or the defendant. The invoices and credit notes could have been properly grouped into discrete issues in the interest of clarity and to facilitate proper examination, but unfortunately, because the parties were often at cross purposes when scoping the issues, this was not done in an adequate manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The trial was heard over six days. The defendant called one witness to give evidence at trial: Mr Ramu Chidambaram (“Ramu”). Ramu is the sole director of the defendant. Initially, the plaintiff intended to call two witnesses to give evidence at trial: Mr Abraham Isaac (“Abraham”) and Mr David Isaac (“David”). Abraham is David’s father, and both are directors of the plaintiff. For reasons that will become apparent, Abraham eventually did not turn up at trial. I will discuss the implications of this in due course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The trial has been bifurcated between liability and quantum. Therefore, this judgment will focus on issues of liability including the issue of the net amount of debt owed. The issues relating to the quantification such as the assessment of damages arising from breaches of the Agreement will be dealt with in a subsequent hearing before the Registrar.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The plaintiff has three directors and shareholders, Abraham, David and Mr Jeremy Isaac.

These major retailers included supermarket chains such as NTUC Fairprice, Cold Storage, Giant and Shop N Save as well as convenience stores chains such as 7-Eleven and Cheers. The brands behind these chains are under the ownership of two companies: NTUC Co-operative Ltd (“NTUC”) (which owns NTUC Fairprice and Cheers) and Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited (“Dairy Farm”) (which owns Cold Storage, Giant, Shop N Save and 7-Eleven).

Each SKU would correspond to one particular product sold by the defendant or plaintiff to a retailer. Since it would take some time for the accounts to be set up and for the SKUs to be transferred, the plaintiff agreed to collect money from the retailers on behalf of the defendant in the interim.

</div> The plaintiff took the opposite position, and was of the view that it was the defendant that owed the plaintiff more money at the point. By this time the “contra arrangement” (see [5] above) was in full force, and neither party would pay each other. This was due to a wide array of disputes, some of which I set out below for context:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant alleged that some of the stock it was sold was defective, either because they were unmerchantable or close to expiry.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The parties could not agree on which party should bear the cost of certain rebates, allowances and promotional charges (“Promotional Charges”) that the retailers imposed. The retailers would either invoice a seller directly for the Promotional Charges, or deduct the charges from the sales collection they would pay out to the seller. Since the plaintiff was the party with the SKUs for the Products for the period of February to April 2013, it was the plaintiff that was invoiced by the retailers, and the sales collections collected by the plaintiff were also correspondingly reduced by the retailers. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The parties also could not agree on whether the plaintiff should pay the defendant the sales collections collected on behalf of the defendant the moment the Products were sold to the retailers, or only after the plaintiff had collected money from the retailers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On 9 April 2013, plaintiff sent an email to the defendant titled “amended written agreement”, which enclosed a draft written contract (“9 April Draft”).

However, Abraham chose not to show up for trial. The plaintiff now urges the court to admit Abraham’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) despite his absence at trial.

Additionally, the court in <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Ting v Kea </span><span class="font-italic">Kah Lim </span>[2014] 4 SLR 795 (“<span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Ting</span>”) examined s 32 of the EA and concluded that the provisions do apply to AEICs (see <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Ting</span> at [13]–[15]). This position was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Cheo</span><span class="font-italic"> Yeoh &amp; Associates LLC and another v AEL and others </span>[2015] 4 SLR 325 at [94]–[96], where the court affirmed a trial judge’s decision to admit an AEIC pursuant to s 32. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 However, an AEIC of a witness who is absent from trial is not to be admitted as a matter of course. From the wording of s 32 of the EA as set out above, it is clear that there are two requirements before such an AEIC can be admitted pursuant to s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(iii). First the witness must be outside of Singapore, and second it must not be practicable to secure his attendance: s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>(iii). Even if these two requirements are met, the court nevertheless can exclude the AEIC if it is not in the interest of justice to admit the AEIC: s 32(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal </span>[2015] 2 SLR 686 (“<span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span>”) examined the requirements of s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(iii) of the EA in some detail. The court highlighted that the burden of proving the requirements of s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) lies with the party seeking to rely on that provision (see <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span> at [97]). The court also stated that “what is ‘practicable’ is open to interpretation and would depend on the circumstances” (see <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span> at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present proceedings, the first requirement is not disputed: both parties agree that Abraham is currently living in Australia. However, the parties are disputing whether it is practicable to secure Abraham’s attendance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 At the trial itself, no evidence was tendered to explain why it was not practicable to secure Abraham’s attendance. However, as highlighted, prior to trial, the plaintiff had made an application for Abraham to give evidence via video-link due to his phobia of heights. It appears that the factual basis of the plaintiff’s arguments on impracticability is Abraham’s purported phobia of heights.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Abraham and Ramu had jointly visited the offices of various companies located at relatively high floors in the past, and yet Ramu did not observe any signs of stress or anxiety on the part of Abraham;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff’s own office at Orchard Towers, which Abraham had frequented and used, was located on the 10th floor;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The hearing dates were taken a year in advance, but the application to give evidence via video-link or make special provision for Abraham’s condition was only made about a month prior to trial; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) While the plaintiff did manage to produce a medical certificate stating that Abraham suffers from a phobia of heights, the defendant has highlighted that the medical certificate was produced by a general practitioner and not a specialist in such conditions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In light of the questionable nature of the assertion made by the plaintiff, I decided to give the plaintiff an opportunity to clear all doubts on Abraham’s condition by directing the parties to arrange for a medical expert to examine Abraham in court to verify his claim, with the losing party bearing the cost of the examination. Despite this, Abraham has decided not to show up at trial. In the circumstances, the plaintiff has adduced insufficient evidence to prove that it was impracticable to secure Abraham’s attendance due to his purported medical condition. On this basis, Abraham’s AEIC cannot be admitted via s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(iii) of the EA. I now turn to examine the plaintiff’s argument on O 38 r 2(1) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Order 38 r 2(1) states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Evidence by affidavit (O. 38, r. 2)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.</span>—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of Rule 1, and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at the trial of an action commenced by writ, evidence-in-chief of a witness shall be given by way of affidavit and, unless the Court otherwise orders or the parties to the action otherwise agree, such a witness shall attend trial for cross-examination and, <span class="font-italic">in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received</span><span class="font-italic"> in evidence except with the leave of the Court</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As seen from the italicized portion set out above, the court has the discretion to grant leave under O 38 r 2(1) of the ROC.

I agree with this view. It would require compelling reasons before a party, that has failed to admit an affidavit via s 32 of the EA, can convince the court to exercise its discretion under O 38 r 2(1) of the ROC to admit the same affidavit.

This includes a consideration of the following issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the plaintiff was in breach of a term prohibiting direct sale of the Products to 3rd party customers;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the plaintiff was in breach of an obligation to clear “short-term expiry stock”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the plaintiff was in breach of an obligation to ensure that products sold to the defendant would be merchantable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Third, I will consider the alleged debts owed under the Instalment Scheme and the reasons given for the defendant’s refusal to pay. The issues to be considered include: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the plaintiff or the defendant should bear the costs of the Promotional Charges; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the defendant is obliged to pay any remaining amount under the Instalment Scheme. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Fourth, I will consider the issues relating to Ruby Warehouse including: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the defendant is liable to pay rent for February, March and April 2013;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the defendant’s removal from the warehouse on 30 April 2013 constitutes wrongful termination of the Agreement; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the defendant is liable to pay rent for May 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The fifth category pertains to the plaintiff’s allegations of the defendant’s breaches including:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the defendant was obliged to pay for incoming and new stock that had been ordered;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the defendant was in breach of an obligation to maintain sufficient stock levels; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the defendant breached a term by setting up the Dairy Farm and NTUC accounts in April 2013 and transferring the relevant SKUs in May 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The sixth category of issues focuses on the termination of the Agreement. This category will consider whether the plaintiff had properly terminated the Agreement, and the date it was terminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The miscellaneous category will consider a variety of miscellaneous claims which will be elaborated upon at the appropriate juncture. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 A key difficulty in the present case is that the Agreement was not reduced into writing and signed. Instead the parties are alleging breaches of terms of an agreement that was made orally, albeit with subsequent unsigned documents as evidence of its terms. This requires the court to embark on a fact finding exercise in order to first ascertain the terms of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The court in <span class="font-italic">Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 1 SLR (R) 927 at [46] has highlighted that in the process of ascertaining the terms of a contract, a holistic approach considering both documentary evidence and witness testimony is to be to undertaken. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the context of determining the existence of an oral agreement, the court in <span class="font-italic">ARS v ART and </span><span class="font-italic">another </span>[2015] SGHC 78 (“<span class="font-italic">ARS</span>”) at [53] has stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53 I distil the following guiding principles on the proper approach for determining the existence of an oral agreement as set out in the cases cited above:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)  in ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court will consider the relevant documentary evidence (such as written correspondence) and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)   where possible, the court should look first at the relevant documentary evidence;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the availability of relevant documentary evidence reduces the need to rely solely on the credibility of witnesses in order to ascertain if an oral agreement exists;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) oral testimony may be less reliable as it is based on the witness’ recollection and it may be affected by subsequent events (such as the dispute between the parties);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) credible oral testimony may clarify the existing documentary evidence;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) where the witness is not legally trained, the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) if there is little or no documentary evidence, the court will nevertheless examine the precise factual matrix to ascertain if there is an oral agreement concluded between the parties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The plaintiff urges the court to adopt similar principles in the present case. I agree that the principles that guide the court in determining the existence of an oral contract<span class="font-italic"> </span>are broadly applicable in the context of ascertaining the terms of an oral contract as well. Both involve a holistic view of the evidence in order to determine what (if anything) was agreed between the parties. As <span class="font-italic">ARS</span> makes clear, relevant documentary evidence and the contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time is generally more reliable than the subsequent testimony of the witnesses, which may be affected by the passage of time and the interposition of an acrimonious dispute between the parties. Nevertheless, the absence of documentary evidence is not fatal to a claim, and the court can and will examine the precise factual matrix to ascertain the agreed terms of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Witness credibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As can be seen from the foregoing, witness testimony is important evidence in the course of ascertaining the terms of the Agreement. As such, before delving into the issues proper, I will make some remarks on the credibility of the two witnesses that appeared before me at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I find that David was generally a reliable witness of truth. He provided clear and direct answers in cross-examination and did not waver when confronted with apparent difficulties in his case. He also provided cogent and logical explanations in re-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In contrast, I find that Ramu was evasive, contradictory and vague when confronted with the difficulties in his case. There were many examples of such behaviour over the course of trial, but I will only highlight two instances to illustrate my point:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ramu alleged in the middle of trial that certain cartons of goods were not properly delivered to him. When confronted with documentary evidence that showed that the number of cartons of those goods in his warehouse had in fact increased, suggesting that the goods were in fact delivered, he conjured up an explanation that the documentary evidence was reporting the goods in the smaller unit of “boxes” instead of “cartons”. Time had to be expended in order to calculate the quantity of goods in his warehouse based on this alleged unit of measurement. As it turned out, regardless of whichever unit of measurement was used, the documentary evidence clearly contradicted Ramu’s allegation.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this context, the labels of “appointment as distributor” and “sale of distributorship business” are not terms of art and without clarity over precisely how the obligations between the two versions of the Agreement differ, there is a real danger that the parties would be arguing over semantic differences rather than a difference in the substance of the Agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As such, I sought clarity over the matter at trial. After significant questioning, it appears that the key distinction between the two versions of the Agreement put forth is that under the plaintiff’s version, the defendant’s appointment could be terminated and upon termination the transaction would be “reversed” in the limited sense that the customer accounts and day-to-day operation of the distributorship would revert back to the plaintiff, whereas under the defendant’s version, once the business was sold, the only way to “reverse” the transaction was for the plaintiff to make a fresh offer to repurchase the business, and for the defendant to agree to sell the business.

In particular they assume it is relevant in relation to the plaintiff’s claim for damages for the defendant’s retention of the SKUs (see [21] above). Given that I had already decided in SUM 3675/2014 that the defendant was obliged to return the SKUs to the plaintiff after the termination of the Agreement, it is unclear what more a finding on this point will add to the quantification of loss. In any event, it will be for the parties during the assessment of damages phase to draw the links as appropriate and for present purposes I will proceed on the assumption that this issue will having a bearing on quantification.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I agree with the plaintiff’s characterisation of the legal relationship between the parties.

I reiterate that the final position taken by the defendant is that any dispute as to the terms of the Agreement is confined to the changes and additions raised in the Kalamohan Letter (see [17] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The undisputed portions make clear that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  The defendant was expressly stated to be appointed by the plaintiff as a distributor and there was no indication that the Agreement involved a sale of the business (see clause 2.1);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Agreement specified a business arrangement that involved the defendant periodically purchasing the Products from the plaintiff. It also imposed continuing obligations on the parties. For example, the defendant was obliged to purchase a minimum amount of goods in order to maintain sufficient stock levels (see recital (C), clauses 5.3 and 9.1.4);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The SKUs remained the “property” of the plaintiff (see clause 4.9). It is unclear precisely what clause 4.9 means and the parties did not make any arguments on the nature of the SKUs as property. Regardless, the point remains that to the extent that the customer accounts are linked to the SKUs, the plaintiff did not irrevocably transfer the customer accounts to the defendant; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) There were clear provisions for the termination of the Agreement, including a shorter notice period for termination if the obligations imposed by the Agreement were not adhered to (see cll 3.1 and 15.1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defendant’s claim that the entire business was sold to it, with no possibility of return of the plaintiff’s customer accounts in the absence of a fresh agreement, appears to contradict the abovementioned undisputed clauses of the 9 April Draft. Instead, the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant was merely appointed as a distributor, and his term as a distributor could be terminated, whereupon the customer accounts represented by the SKUs would revert to the plaintiff, appears far more consistent with the clauses set out above.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Second, the contemporaneous documentary evidence supports the plaintiff’s position. In February 2013, when the plaintiff was in the process of informing its customers (the retailers) about the Agreement with the defendant, the plaintiff repeatedly represented to these retailers that the defendant was being appointed as its distributor. Despite this, there was no protest from the defendant on this characterisation even up till April 2013.

</div> by which point the parties’ relationship had deteriorated considerably. In addition, even the Kalamohan Letter sent on July 2013, which set out the disputes as to the terms of the Agreement did not contain an objection to clause 2.1. Clause 2.1 clearly states that the defendant was appointed as a distributor. The Kalamohan Letter also did not mention anything concerning a sale of the business. Ramu did not satisfactorily address these glaring discrepancies in his evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Third, Ramu’s evidence on the purported “sale of business” was evasive, inconsistent and difficult to decipher.

</div>
</div>
</div> I refer to this term as the “Clearance Term”. I find that the defendant has failed to prove the existence of this term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The defendant relies on three pieces of evidence to establish the existence of the Clearance Term: The Instalment Scheme, Ramu’s testimony and the Kalamohan Letter. I do not think that the evidence adduced is sufficient to prove the defendant’s case on this point. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Instalment Scheme</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The defendant argues that the fact that the sums due under the Instalment Scheme was to be spread over a 3-month period demonstrates the existence of the Clearance Term. In my view, the fact that payment was to be spread over a 3-month period is a weak basis to support the conclusion that the Clearance Term exists. There could be a variety of equally compelling reasons that the payment terms were spread out over a 3-month period. For example, it could merely be to address liquidity concerns or make it easier for the defendant to pay the total sum due under the Instalment Scheme. Without more, the existence of the Instalment Scheme is insufficient to demonstrate the existence of the Clearance Term. Unfortunately, the rest of the evidence relied on by the defendant did not aid in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ramu’s testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Ramu’s testimony on this point was weak. The defendant’s position is that the Clearance Term was part of the Agreement, made on 1 February 2013. Hence, at the bare minimum, there must have been some agreement between the parties on the definition of “short-term expiry stock” at or before 1 February. Ramu’s testimony demonstrated that this was not the case. During cross-examination, Ramu admitted that at the material time, there was no discussion to define the requisite length of time before expiry that would qualify stocks as short-term expiry stocks.

</div> I find David’s explanation believable. The title, timing and contents of the email corroborate David’s testimony on the events of 27 February 2013. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) David sent an email on 9 April 2013 to Ramu. The email is titled “New Prices to Fortune Marketing”. An updated price schedule as well as the 9 April Draft was attached to the email. The email states “Dear Ramu, [p]lease see your updated price schedule plus the <span class="font-italic">updated contract</span>. Changes have been made to page 2-4 of the contract” [emphasis added]. The contents of the email, in particular, the reference to the 9 April Draft as an <span class="font-italic">updated</span> contract and specific references to pages of a written contract, strongly suggest that Ramu had sight of an earlier written draft and the 9 April Draft was an updated version of that earlier draft.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, Ramu’s affidavit filed for the purposes of contesting SUM 3675/2014 appears to admit to an earlier draft. The affidavit refers to the 9 April Draft as the “revised Written Agreement”.

</div> This phrasing presupposes that there was a prior written draft that was subsequently revised to form the 9 April Draft. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Third, Ramu could not give any satisfactory explanation to blunt the impact of the evidence highlighted above at [85]–[86]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) With regard to the email sent on 27 February 2013, Ramu claimed that David would have sent him the email directly since David had a law degree, and hence the fact that David only sent Pooi Yen alone demonstrates that he did not receive the 27 February Draft.

</div> Seen in light of the rest of the evidence, I did not find his explanation on this convincing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Hence, in light of all the evidence highlighted above, coupled with Ramu’s relative lack of credibility vis-à-vis David (see [59]–[60] above), I find that the defendant did have sight of the 27 February Draft sometime around 27 February 2013 and agreed to the terms set out within the draft. Hence, the 27 February Draft is an accurate documentary record of the terms of the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Kalamohan Letter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Turning back to the Kalamohan Letter, I find that the 27 February Draft is a more contemporaneous and accurate record of the Agreement of 1 February 2013. The Kalamohan Letter, which was sent some five months after the entry into the Agreement and sent at a time when the relationship between the parties had already deteriorated considerably, does not adequately assist in determining the terms agreed between the parties at the material time. As such, the fact that the Clearance Term appears in the Kalamohan Letter is not sufficiently probative in light of the absence of the Clearance Term in the 27 February Draft. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Therefore, for the reasons given above, I find that the defendant has failed to prove the existence of the Clearance Term. Hence, the plaintiff cannot breach the Clearance Term.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The obligation to ensure that products sold to the defendant would be merchantable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The defendant alleges that there was an express or implied term that the Products sold to the defendant were “merchantable or saleable or unexpired or not dead or not de-listed”. I shall call this term the “Merchantable Products Term”. I find that the defendant has failed to prove the existence of an express or implied term to this effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It is important to first elaborate on the scope of the Merchantable Products Term. It appears that in response to a request for further and better particulars, the defendant had drawn up a list of problems with the goods it had purchased from the plaintiff.

</div> It is a leap of logic to suggest that merely stating the prospective profit margin of a distributor would amount to a promise to guarantee that same profit margin. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 This lack of evidence on the defendant’s part must be seen in light of the fact that the 27 February Draft did not contain the Merchantable Products Term. As mentioned above at [80]–[88], the 27 February Draft is an accurate documentary record of the terms of the Agreement. In fact, even the Kalamohan Letter did not contain any mention of the Merchantable Products Term.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In the interest of completeness, I would highlight that even if the Merchantable Products Term was set to a slightly lower threshold, namely, that the plaintiff was obliged to repurchase the allegedly unmerchantable goods at cost price (as opposed to adding a profit margin on top of cost price), the defendant would nevertheless have failed to prove this term. This is because there is simply insufficient evidence to suggest that the plaintiff had agreed to any such term pertaining to the allegedly unmerchantable goods. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 It is true that the plaintiff did repurchase some of the allegedly unmerchantable goods back from the defendant via credit notes. However, the question is whether the plaintiff did so pursuant to a legal obligation contained within the Agreement, or whether the plaintiff did so out of goodwill. On balance, I find that the evidence points towards the latter rather than the former. In this regard I rely on the fact that the 27 February Draft contained no such term as well as the fact that the “stock handover list” (see [14(d)] above) that was signed by Mahipal on behalf of the defendant clearly set out the respective expiry dates of the goods sold to the defendant, but there was no indication in February 2013 that the defendant took issue with the dates.

One exception to this general rule is where no prejudice is caused to the other party at trial or it would be clearly unjust for the court not to depart from the rule (see <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia</span> at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The deficiency in pleadings in the present case has caused prejudice to the plaintiff. In this regard, I note that one way the plaintiff could have addressed the defendant’s argument on wrongful termination would be to prove that the plaintiff was entitled to remove the defendant from Ruby Warehouse if the defendant refused to pay rent for a sustained period of time. They could have done so either by implying a term in fact, or by proposing an interpretation of the existing terms of the Agreement to that effect. However, in order to make such arguments on the construction of the Agreement, the plaintiff would have to satisfy the pleading requirements laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> at [73]. Due to the fact that the defendant has failed to give the plaintiff notice of its intention to pursue the allegation that the removal of the defendant constituted breach and/or wrongful termination, the plaintiff was denied the opportunity to amend its pleadings and prepare a case to meet the defendant’s allegation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Therefore, since it was not properly pleaded, I will not allow the defendant to rely on this particular allegation to show that the Agreement was wrongfully terminated. Instead, I will operate on the premise implicit in the pleadings as they stand: that the plaintiff was entitled to remove the defendant from Ruby Warehouse. Hence, there is no wrongful termination of the Agreement due to the defendant’s removal from Ruby Warehouse. This leads to the next issue, whether, after its removal from Ruby Warehouse, the defendant was liable for rent for the month of May 2013. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The obligation to pay rent for May 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The plaintiff claims rent for the month of May 2013 because the defendant refused to clear all its stock from Ruby Warehouse by the deadline of 30 April 2013,

The email states: “We will be charging you $500.00 a day for warehousing your stock. The charges will commence 1 May 2013.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I highlight that this rate of $500 per day is not founded on the Agreement, since clause 4.6 of the 9 April Draft sets out a rent of $8,367.40 per month. What the plaintiff appears to be suggesting is that there was a fresh agreement for the defendant to rent Ruby Warehouse at a rate of $500 per day. I do not think the email was sufficient to demonstrate an agreement to that effect. The plaintiff merely declared that $500 would be charged, but the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence to show that the defendant had accepted this rate. Hence, on an examination of the factual matrix, I find that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the parties had agreed for the defendant to use Ruby Warehouse to store its remaining stock at a rate of $500 per day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Nevertheless, the defendant’s did use the plaintiff’s warehouse space to store its leftover stock in May 2013. Hence, I find that the plaintiff is entitled to a <span class="font-italic">quantum </span><span class="font-italic">meruit</span> claim for the use of the its warehouse space for the period of May 2013. I shall leave the parties to make the appropriate arguments at the quantification stage of proceedings to establish the precise amount to be paid, but at this stage it appears that some relevant factors include the parties’ original agreement as to monthly rent (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> $8,367.40) and the space taken up by the leftover stock as a proportion of the total warehouse space of Ruby Warehouse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Therefore, I reject the plaintiff’s argument on rent for the month of May 2013, subject to the qualification that the plaintiff is entitled to a <span class="font-italic">quantum </span><span class="font-italic">meruit </span>claim, with the precise sum to be subsequently assessed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: The plaintiff’s allegations of breach</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendant was obliged to pay for incoming and new stock that had been ordered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Initially, the plaintiff and defendant disagreed on whether certain invoices were due from the defendant to the plaintiff.

</div>
</div> To arrive at these dates, the plaintiff made the assumption that the quantity of the products would decrease at a monthly rate corresponding with the average monthly sales figures for the respective product. Additionally, the plaintiff highlighted that all the defendant’s stock of Naughty G Original was slated to expire on 9 September 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In effect the plaintiff is suggesting that the defendant would have inevitably have breached the agreement by May 2013 and September 2013 respectively. There are three intractable problems with the plaintiff’s argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 First, the defendant’s obligations under clause 9.1.4 only extended to holding 2.5 months’ worth of stock at any point in time. No alternative interpretation of clause 9.1.4. was proffered by the plaintiff. As at April 2013, this obligation was not breached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Second, the factual premise of the plaintiff’s argument, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it was inevitable that the defendant’s stock levels would fall below 2.5 months is untrue. The plaintiff’s argument is premised on an assumption of a decline in stock levels at a steady rate, based on the average monthly sales figures. However, the average monthly sales figures are merely a projection of the rate of decline and cannot be used to determine and prove the actual stock levels at the material time of May and September 2013.  There are a variety of plausible alternative possibilities that could have occurred with respect to the rates of decline. As an illustration, there could have been a rapid decline in the sales of product in the subsequent months given the troubles between the plaintiff and defendant.  In respect of the expiry date, there are also other plausible alternatives, for example, the defendant may have been able to acquire additional stock prior to expiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Third and in any event, my attention was not drawn to any authorities which suggests that an “inevitable” breach of a future obligation is an actionable breach of contract prior to the time for the performance of that obligation. I note the existence of the doctrine of anticipatory breach. However, the plaintiff has made no arguments on this doctrine in its submissions. This is probably because an unaccepted anticipatory repudiatory breach of contract cannot form the basis of an actionable breach of contract unless and until the actual time for performance of the obligation arises (see <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> vol 1 (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Chitty</span>”) at para 24–025). Here, the plaintiff’s own position is that it elected to terminate the contract only on 5 June 2013 (see [37] above) and hence even assuming that the defendant had committed an anticipatory repudiatory breach of the Agreement on April 2013 by refusing to order additional stock, this is in itself irrelevant to prove an actionable breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Insofar as the plaintiff is claiming that there was a breach of clause 9.1.4 at May and September 2013, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show proof that the stock levels had fallen below the requisite threshold at the <span class="font-italic">time of performance of the obligation</span> on May and September 2013. No evidence was adduced on this matter. In this regard, given the plaintiff’s position that the Agreement was terminated on 5 June 2013, there would be no obligation under clause 9.1.4 in September 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Therefore, I find that the plaintiff has not proved a breach of the term reflected in clause 9.1.4 of the 9 April Draft. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendant breached a term by setting up the Dairy Farm and NTUC accounts in April 2013 and transferring the relevant SKUs in May 2013 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 As highlighted (see [15] above), in order to sell the Products directly to retailers, the defendant was required to set up an account with the retailers, and have the relevant SKUs transferred to its account. Both parties are in agreement that the defendant had an obligation to set up an account with Dairy Farm and NTUC and transfer the SKUs corresponding to the Products to its accounts. However, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has breached this obligation because the defendant only set up accounts with Diary Farm and NTUC sometime in the middle of April 2013, and transferred the SKUs sometime in the middle of May 2013, some three months after entering into the Agreement on 1 February 2013.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The lack of a stipulation as to time is not fatal to the plaintiff’s case.  This is because where a contract does not specify the time for performance by a party that has undertaken to carry out such performance, an obligation to perform within a reasonable time is implied in law: <span class="font-italic">Max Master Holdings Ltd and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Taufik Surya Dharma and others and another suit</span> [2016] SGHC 147 at [98]. What is “reasonable” would depend on all the circumstances of the case, and the court is not limited to what the parties contemplated or ought to have foreseen at the time of entry into the contract: <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> at para 21–021. Hence the crux of the present issue is whether the defendant had performed its obligation within a reasonable time by setting up accounts with retailers in April 2013, and transferring the SKUs in May 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I find that the defendant had not performed the obligation within a reasonable time. The evidence of David, which I accept, is that based on his previous experience with opening new accounts with the retailers in question, it would take typically two to three weeks to open an account with a retailer.

</div>
</div> David also suggested that it would take a few days to a week to transfer the SKUs once an account is set up. I note that the defendant did not offer an alternative reasonable duration for the obligation to be performed. Hence I find that a reasonable time to open an account would be three weeks and a reasonable amount of time to transfer the SKUs would be a further week after the opening of an account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In fairness to the defendant, although it was not highlighted by counsel in submissions, it appears that the plaintiff only informed the retailers of its intention to hand over the SKUs for the Products to the defendant sometime in late February via emails sent between 21 to 25 February 2013.

</div> However, even giving the defendant the benefit of the doubt and starting to count time from 25 February 2013, the opening of the accounts in the middle of April would go beyond the reasonable amount of time of three weeks. The transfer of the SKUs took a further month from the time taken to open the accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 As such, I find that the defendant had breached its implied obligation in law to be “registered” with the retailers within a reasonable time.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 6: Termination of the agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The defendant submits that the plaintiff wrongfully terminated the agreement on 30 April 2013 by removing the defendant from the warehouse.

</div> I shall deal with each argument in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 On the first ground, the plaintiff merely asserts that it was entitled to immediately terminate the Agreement due to the significant breaches of the defendant without further elaboration. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2007] 4 SLR (R) 413 (“<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>”) set out four different situations under which an innocent party to a contract may elect to terminate the contract (see <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> at [91]–[113]). It appears that the plaintiff is suggesting that the defendant’s breaches fall within “Situation 3(a)” or “Situation 3(b)” of the situations identified in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The difficulty with the plaintiff’s argument is that within the Agreement, there is a contractual provision for notice to be given prior to termination for significant breaches. The parties do not dispute that clause 15.1 of the 9 April Draft accurately reflects the terms of the Agreement and it reads:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.1 Either Party will have the right to terminate this Agreement when there is a significant breach of this Agreement by the other Party when the affected Party gives the Party in Breach written notice of the breach and a notice period of 10 (Ten) working days to correct their breach</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 If “significant breach” in clause 15.1 is read to mean a breach of a condition or a breach with consequences which will deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract, this provision may overlap with the plaintiff’s right in law to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Situation 3(a) or Situation 3(b) of <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>respectively. There appears to be an issue of how the term captured in clause 15.1 interacts with the plaintiff’s right to terminate in law pursuant to Situation 3(a) or (b) of <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>. This is significant because clause 15.1 imports a notice requirement before any party is entitled to terminate for a “significant breach”. The question therefore is whether the plaintiff can nonetheless terminate for significant breaches immediately pursuant to either Situation 3(a) or Situation 3(b), despite the express notice provision. This is a question of interpretation of the relevant clauses to determine whether the parties intended to exclude the right to terminate at common law (see <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> at para 22-049). Given that the plaintiff did not make any submissions on this point and in particular, no construction of clause 15.1 was offered, I will not find for the plaintiff based on its first argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Nevertheless, I find that the contract was properly terminated on 5 June 2013 because I agree that pursuant to the term reflected in clause 15.1, the defendant did commit a significant breach, and it was given at least 10 working days’ notice to rectify the breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 By May 2013, the defendant had yet to settle the outstanding sum it owed under the Instalment Scheme. I have found that this outstanding sum is owed to the plaintiff (see [120] above). I find that this failure to pay the outstanding sum under the Instalment Scheme was a “significant breach” of the Agreement within meaning of clause 15.1. Non-payment of close to approximately $170,000 is significant in the context of an Agreement that set an original handover fee of approximately $420,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The plaintiff adduced evidence of two letters sent by the plaintiff’s solicitors to the defendant’s solicitors on 14 May 2013 and 22 May 2013 as proof of notice (“14 May Letter” and “22 May Letter” respectively). The 14 May Letter specifically mentions that “despite repeated request from our client to pay for the products and to reimburse the expenses incurred by them, you have only paid some monies towards the outstanding sum” and requested that the defendant make payment on all the invoices issued by the plaintiff.

</div> I accept that the plaintiff had fulfilled its delivery obligations by delivering the goods to Ruby Warehouse, which was in the control of the defendant on 29 April 2013. The plaintiff had in fact repurchased the Organic Water from the defendant by cancelling Invoice 7369 and issuing two credit notes labelled “CR003285” and “CR003301” after the defendant’s refusal to collect the Organic Water. The defendant however is now claiming in Invoice 381 a sum for “loss of sale” in addition to the original purchase price of the Organic Water. The defendant is in substance claiming a sum inclusive of the profit it would have made if it had sold the Organic Water to retailers. I find that the plaintiff has no obligation to compensate the defendant for “loss of sale” and the defendant has no claim to the purchase price since it has already been credited by the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The plaintiff claims it is owed rental as well as various related costs such as vehicle insurance and road tax for the use of the Three Vehicles. It is not disputed that while initially these vehicles were meant to be purchased by the defendant under the Agreement, the parties were eventually unable to agree on a price for the purchase and the parties in effect mutually agreed to remove the term from the Agreement. The vehicles were nevertheless used by the defendant for three months. Since the defendant had been conferred a benefit through the use of the plaintiff’s vehicles, I find that the defendant owed the plaintiff’s reasonable rent and expenses for the use of the vehicles on a <span class="font-italic">quantum </span><span class="font-italic">meruit</span> basis. The plaintiff has charged the defendant rent and expenses (such as road tax) for the period of the use of the vehicles pursuant to two invoices labelled as “Invoice 7438” and “Invoice 7424”. The defendant has not offered any alternative calculation for the reasonable sum to be charged, instead focusing on whether any sum was owed at all in respect of two vehicles. As such, I accept Invoice 7438 and Invoice 7424 as reasonable estimations of rent and expenses owed to the plaintiff for the use of the Three Vehicles.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total debts owed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 In the interest of clarity, I set out a table in Annex 1 based on the various invoices and credit notes claimed by both sides. After setting off the respective debts owed, a total sum of <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">$</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">125,561.23</span> is owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. The table is partially based on an exhibit compiled jointly by the plaintiff and the defendant, where the plaintiff sets out its position with respect to all the invoices and credit notes and the defendant places its response to the same.
