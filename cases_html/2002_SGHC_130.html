<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Facts </p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The appellant was the private trustee of the estate of Goh Poh Choo in

bankruptcy (‘Goh’). Goh was adjudicated bankrupt on 21 July 2000. Prior to that,

she had paid $101,500 to the respondents who were partners of the law firm which acted for

her in respect of a suit brought against her by a judgment creditor. The judgment

creditor’s claim was dismissed by the High Court, but was reversed by the Court of

Appeal on 13 April 2000. In the meantime, the said sum of money had been paid by Goh to

the respondents in two tranches: $56,500 was paid on 25 June 1999 and $45,000 on 4 April

2000 (nine days before the Court of Appeal’s decision). The appellant made an

application for the sum to be repaid to the bankrupt’s estate on account of unfair

preference under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20) (‘the Act’). The assistant

registrar dismissed the application and the appellant appealed.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held, </p></b>dismissing the appeal 

<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1)        The sum of money was held

by the respondent solicitors as trustees for the client, and they were therefore

"associates" of the bankrupt by virtue of s 101(5) of the Act (see  6 –

7).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2)        In determining whether

there was unfair preference, the court has to ascertain whether the bankrupt had been

influenced by a desire to put the payee in a better position than he would have been, in

the event of the bankrupt becoming a bankrupt. The legal fees did not appear in any way

excessive such that the intention of the payor to pay his solicitors in the ordinary

course of business can reasonably be doubted. The evidence on record was sufficient to

rebut the presumption of unfair preference. The fact that $45,000 of the total fees were

paid about nine days before the Court of Appeal decision was not sufficient to indicate

unfair preference on the part of the bankrupt (see  10 – 11).</p>

<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        This was an appeal by Mr.

Soh Gim Chuan (the appellant) the private trustee of the estate of Goh Poh Choo in

bankruptcy. The appellant applied before the assistant registrar for an order that the

respondents pay a sum of $101,500 to the bankrupt’s estate. This sum of money was

previously paid by the bankrupt (before her bankruptcy) to the respondents as legal fees.

The respondents were at all material times partners of the law firm that had acted for her

in respect of a suit brought by the judgment creditor against her in the High Court. The

judgment creditor’s claim was dismissed by the trial judge on 30 August 1999. The

judgment creditor appealed and the appeal was heard on 22 February 2000. The Court of

Appeal handed down its verdict on 13 April 2000 in favour of the judgment creditor. Goh

Poh Choo was adjudicated a bankrupt on 21 July 2000. In the meantime, the said sum of

$101,500 was paid to the respondents as legal fees in two tranches. The first, $56,500 was

paid on 25 June 1999 and the second, $45,000 on 4 April 2000 (nine days before the Court

of Appeal’s decision). The appellant’s application was based on unfair

preference under the Bankruptcy Act, Ch 20. His application was dismissed by the assistant

registrar and he appealed to this court against that decision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        Mr. Gwee, one of the two

respondents appeared on behalf of the respondents. He raised a preliminary objection on

the ground that the appellant had no standing to make this application because he is a

private trustee of the bankrupt’s estate. Mr. Gwee’s argument was that only the

Official Assignee is empowered to make this application. Counsel relied on s 36 which

provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"36. - (1) Subject to subsection (3) and section 39, a trustee

        shall –</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) have all the functions and duties of the Official Assignee in

          relation to the conduct of a bankrupt and

          the               

          administration of his estate as provided in this Act; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) exercise all the powers of the Official Assignee."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        Mr. Gwee says that in

order for the private trustee to be endowed with all the power of the Official Assignee he

must first administer the estate of the bankrupt under as provided under s 36(1)(a). I

have no difficulty ruling against Mr. Gwee on this point as it seems clear to me that s

36(1)(a) and (b) complement each other and are not subject to either in the way argued by

Mr. Gwee, nor are they mutually exclusive. I do not need to dwell further in an argument

borne out of desperation as this appears to be.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        The salient facts that I

have set out above are not disputed by any party. There are, therefore, only two points in

contention that are relevant to the appeal. First, in order to determine whether the

payments of the $90,000 are subject to recovery as being payments made as "unfair

preferences", the relevant time must be ascertained.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        The act provides for three

time periods. These are set out in s 100(1) (a) to (c) as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"100. – (1) Subject to this section, the time at which an

    individual enters into a transaction at an undervalue or gives an unfair preference shall

    be a relevant time if the transaction is entered into or the preference given –</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    in the case of a transaction at an undervalue,

          within the period of 5 years ending with the day of

          the                 

          presentation of the bankruptcy petition on which the individual is adjudged bankrupt;</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    in the case of an unfair preference which is not

          a        transaction at an undervalue and is given to a

          person           who is an associate of

          the individual (otherwise

          than            by reason only of

          being his employee), within

          the           period of 2 years ending

          with that day; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    in any other case of an unfair preference which

          is not a transaction at an undervalue, within the period of

          6           months ending with that

          day."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        Only (b) and (c) are

relevant for our purposes since the earlier of the two payments (that is the $56,500

payment) was made within two years. This depends on whether the respondents are

"associates" of the bankrupt as defined in s 101(5) which provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"101. – (5) A person in his capacity as trustee of a trust is

  an associate of an individual if the beneficiaries of the trust include, or the terms of

  the trust confer a power that may be exercised for the benefit of, that individual or an

  associate of that individual."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        Mr. Gwee argued that the

firm of Koh &amp; Partners, in whose client account the money of the bankrupt was

deposited, are not trustees within the meaning of s 101(5). I do not accept this argument

because the words of s 101(5) are simple and straightforward, and are sufficiently broad

to include a solicitor who holds his money in his account. The account is in the name of

the solicitor or his firm, but the money belongs to the client. The money is therefore

held by the solicitor in no other capacity than that of a trustee.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        The second and more

crucial aspect of the appeal is in respect of the question whether the two payments by the

bankrupt amount to "unfair preference". The relevant provision in the Bankruptcy

Act is s 99 which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">99. – (1) Subject to this section and sections 100 and 102, where

    an individual is adjudged bankrupt and he has, at the relevant time (as defined in section

    100), given an unfair preference to any person, the Official Assignee may apply to the

    court for an order under this section.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) The court shall, on such an application, make such order as it

    thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that individual had

    not given that unfair preference.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) For the purposes of this section and sections 100 and 102, an

    individual gives an unfair preference to a person if –</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) that person is one of the individual’s creditors or a surety

        or guarantor for any of his debts or other liabilities; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the individual does anything or suffers anything to be done which

        (in  either case) has the effect of putting that person into a position

        which,     in the event of the individual’s bankruptcy, will be

        better than the           position he

        would have been in if that thing had not been done.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(4) The court shall not make an order under this section in respect of

    an unfair preference given to any person unless the individual who gave the preference was

    influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce in relation to that person the

    effect mentioned in subsection (3)(b).</p>
<p align="justify">(5) An individual who has given an unfair preference to a person who,

    at the time the unfair preference was given, was an associate of his (otherwise than by

    reason only of being his employee) shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to

    have been influenced in deciding to give it by such a desire as is mentioned in subsection

    (4).</p>
<p align="justify">(6) The fact that something has been done in pursuance of the order of

    a court does not, without more, prevent the doing or suffering of that thing from

    constituting the giving of an unfair preference."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The appellant submitted that the assistant registrar was in error

because he did not take into account subsection (5) which, by the presumption raised

against the respondents as trustees, shifted the burden to them. He submitted that the

respondents have not made any point in their affidavit that goes towards rebutting the

presumption.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        In determining whether

there was unfair preference the direct object of the court is to ascertain whether the

bankrupt had been influenced by a desire to put the payee in a better position than he

would have been, in the event of the bankrupt becoming a bankrupt. This exercise naturally

involves a finding of fact to a large extent and thus would vary from case to case. For

instance, the case cited before me, <i>Re Libra Industries Pte Ltd (in compulsory

liquidation)</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49696&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 84</a> turned on its own facts, so different that I need not

elaborate here. See also <i>Re MC Bacon </i>(1990) BCLC 324 in which Millet J emphasized

that it is not sufficient merely to "establish a desire to make payment or grant the

security which it sought to avoid". Otherwise, every payment in itself, other than

perhaps, a payment under mistake, becomes an unfair preference.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        The act or the payment

within the two years or six months prior to the bankruptcy by itself is of little

significance otherwise every payment even to the bankrupt’s grocer will, by the

receipt of payment alone, be counted as an unfair preference. I now revert to the

appellant’s main point, that the respondents had not rebutted the presumption. In

this case, in addition to the public examination of Mr. Gwee Boon Kim (one of the

respondents), Mr. Koh Hai Keong (the other respondent) had filed an affidavit on 15 April

2002. From the evidence of the two respondents I accept that the payments were genuine

payments of legal fees. There is nothing to indicate otherwise. Although counsel examining

Mr. Gwee did not challenge the size of the bills, I am of the view that on a broad scan,

based on the nature of the suit in the High Court, the legal fees did not appear in any

way excessive such that the intention of the payor to pay his solicitors in the ordinary

course of business, can reasonably be doubted. From the evidence available on record, it

would not be wrong for the assistant registrar to accept the payments as having being made

in the ordinary course of business. As I have stated, every case turns on its own facts.

In this case, I am of the view that by the nature of the payments in question, the

evidence on record were sufficient to rebut the presumption of unfair preference.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        Although $45,000 of the

total fees were paid about nine days before the Court of Appeal decision, this fact alone

would not be sufficient to indicate unfair preference on the part of the bankrupt.

Payments are made by clients to their lawyers only upon his solicitor rendering a bill of

costs. In this case, if the respondents (as opposed to the bankrupt) had woken up to the

fact that if the judgment of the High Court was reversed, they (the respondents) may not

be paid, and thus promptly render their bill of costs on the eve of the Court of Appeal

decision, would that indicate unfair preference on the part of the bankrupt? I think not.

The intention to create an unfair preference is the intention of the bankrupt. To

contemplate otherwise without more is to put all solicitors at risk of having to refund

their fees should their clients become bankrupt with two years of payment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        It is thus the misfortune

of the judgment creditor in this case that money she had paid out under a judgment of

court could not be recovered having herself subsequently succeeding on appeal. But such

are the risks inherent in every case. Risks that cannot fully be measured. That is why
