One particular financial product, known as a share ”accumulator”, was the source of many investors’ financial woes during that period, so much so that it earned itself the infamous epithet, the “I kill you later” contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Pursuant to a share accumulator transaction (henceforth referred to as a “share accumulator”), the issuer is obliged to sell shares of a company at a price known as the “strike price” to the investor over an agreed period of time. The strike price is lower than the market price at the beginning of the agreed period. As long as the market price remains above the strike price but below what is known as a “knock-out” price, the investor is obliged to purchase an agreed quantity of shares at the strike price, thus “accumulating” shares in that company, but at a discount. If the market price rises above the knock-out price, the share accumulator is terminated. If it falls below the strike price, the investor is usually required to purchase in multiples of the agreed quantity of shares at set intervals. The knock-out price caps the issuer’s loss, and thus the investor’s gain, should the market price increase, but there is no corresponding limit to the investor’s loss if the market price falls. The huge losses that can be caused by such unlimited downside risk probably explains why many investors have brought actions against their banks seeking to disclaim such share accumulators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The usual complaint, in previous cases involving this financial product, is that the share accumulators were either plainly unauthorised or inadequately explained and misrepresented to the investor. The case before me concerns not one but 103 share accumulators which were transacted over a period of some 18 months from June 2006 to January 2008. The plaintiff investor, First Asia Capital Investments Limited (“FAC”), is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). Its authorised signatories are Mr Lucas (“Lucas”) and his wife, Ms Lenny Patricia Halim Liem (“Lenny”). FAC entered into share accumulators with the first defendant, Société Générale Bank &amp; Trust (“SocGen”), through the second defendant, Ms Karen Cheong Hui Er (“Karen”), its relationship manager. All of these share accumulators were entered into with Lenny’s written approval. What then is FAC’s basis for disowning them? The answer to this basic question is not as straightforward as one would expect. This is because FAC’s statement of claim (“SOC”) underwent six amendments between the commencement of this suit and the trial, which, given that successive amendments bore different colour codes, resulted in a kaleidoscopic seventh version. FAC’s further attempt to amend its SOC <span class="font-italic">after the close of its case</span> was disallowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Although Lucas and Lenny were both authorised signatories of the account, FAC claims, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that there was an oral collateral agreement, between FAC, the bank, and the relationship manager, that no transaction could be validly entered into on FAC’s behalf without the prior approval of Lucas since he was the “main” signatory and Lenny merely the “ancillary” signatory. However, no such distinction was made in the bank’s contractual documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The main dispute turns on a key factual inquiry: was there any such oral collateral agreement? This will have to be assessed with reference to the objective evidence and the conduct of the parties. It will also entail some commonsensical inquiries. Why would a bank enter into a collateral warranty with its customer on terms which contradict its own contractual documents? Further, why would a customer rely on such a collateral agreement which it ought to have known conflicts with the bank’s written terms, especially since there is a foolproof method at its disposal to achieve its intended safeguard, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, removing the wife as an authorised signatory of the account? The answers to these questions must also take into account the fact that Lenny is legally trained

The proceedings were bifurcated and the trial dealt only with the issue of liability. Four witnesses were called: Lucas, Lenny, SocGen’s CEO, Mr Jean-Francois, Michel, Marie Paquereau, and Karen. Given the bifurcation, FAC’s and SocGen’s expert witnesses on the calculation of the alleged losses were not, as originally planned, called to testify. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Having examined all the evidence before the court, it is clear to me that the claim has no merit or factual foundation. This action was brought by FAC in a misconceived attempt to shift responsibility for the consequences of its own investments to the bank. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The present claim relates to FAC’s two accounts with SocGen.

</div> I did not think it right to strike out the SOC in its entirety for a number of reasons, the most significant of which was that FAC’s counsel, Mr Peter Gabriel, persuaded me that there were two specific matters which should be properly ventilated at trial. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, in response to my question as to why Lucas’ instructions to obtain his prior approval was not reduced in writing, Mr Gabriel informed me that Karen was aware that Lucas had no interest in share accumulators and, for that reason, she had specifically sought Lenny’s authorisation <span class="font-italic">only</span> for the share accumulators while all other transactions were authorised by Lucas. The submission at that stage was that Karen had deliberately bypassed Lucas in respect of the risky share accumulators and instead sought Lenny’s authorisation knowing full well that Lucas would not have approved them.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, FAC had pleaded that “all and/or some of [Lenny’s] signatures were obtained after the conclusion of the transactions”;

</div> and there were at least two share accumulators that seemed to have been executed even before the transaction document was sent to Lenny for her signature.

</div> The suggestion was that Lenny signed them without knowing or understanding the nature of the transaction documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is important to note that at the time when this appeal was heard before me, discovery had not taken place. In particular, the transcripts of the telephone instructions between Lenny and Karen (which featured prominently at the trial) were not before the court. As will be seen, however, both these points were refuted at trial (I deal with each of them at [63] and [75]–[76] respectively). In fact, contrary to Mr Gabriel’s submission, when the evidence unfolded (see [66] below), it became clear that Lenny had authorised numerous other transactions <span class="font-italic">beyond</span> the share accumulators. Perhaps that is why FAC did not actively pursue these points either at trial or in its closing submissions.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Based on the facts and pleadings set out above, and as agreed by the parties, there are seven issues to be addressed: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Was there a collateral agreement that the defendants would not deal with the monies in the FAC accounts without the prior approval of Lucas as the main authorised signatory? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If so, what was the legal effect of such a collateral agreement given the contractual terms governing the banker-customer relationship between FAC and SocGen? Did the defendants breach that agreement by entering into the share accumulators? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Did Karen misrepresent to Lenny, prior to entering into each share accumulator transaction, that Lucas had already authorised the share accumulators? If so, is SocGen vicariously liable for Karen’s misrepresentation? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Is FAC permitted by its pleadings to advance the case that notwithstanding Lenny’s written authorisation of the share accumulators, Lenny had in fact not provided prior oral authorisation either directly or through Lucas and Lenny’s personal secretary, Erlina? This issue arose during the trial because FAC claimed that Lenny did not provide prior oral authorisation for some or all of the share accumulators.

It is important to bear in mind that, in the interests of commercial certainty, a finding of a collateral agreement alongside a main contract will not lightly be made; there must be clear proof that all legal requirements of a binding contract have been met, and that its terms are certain (see <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (in liquidation) v Sukamto Sia and another and another appeal</span> [2014] 3 SLR 277 (“<span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span>”) at [18]–[19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 That a collateral agreement is alleged to have been made orally does not mean it does not need to be pleaded with a degree of specificity. In particular, it must at least be reasonably certain when the collateral agreement was concluded. I observed in <span class="font-italic">Likpin</span><span class="font-italic"> International Ltd v Swiber Holdings Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 962, in the context of a striking-out application, that even for a contract which was made orally, there could only be one date on which the contract could be said to have been concluded, and that it was, in that case, “plainly unarguable to assert that an oral contract was concluded over a two-month period” (at [42]). FAC’s pleading here is even less precise than that. It has averred that the collateral agreement was formed “in 2005”. It is plainly inadequate to simply allege that an oral agreement was made in a particular calendar year. Such a general pleading makes it both difficult for the opposing side to know the case it has to meet, and embarrassing for the court to determine based on the evidence whether such an agreement was ever formed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It was also observed in <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line </span>(at [25]) that a court would be “slow to replace the terms of a written contract with the inconsistent and <span class="font-italic">uncertain</span> terms of a collateral agreement” [emphasis added]. Those words of caution are particularly apposite here. As mentioned at [27] above, FAC has not taken a consistent stand on the terms of the collateral agreement. It first pleaded that the defendants were not to invest the FAC account monies without the prior approval of Lucas <span class="font-italic">and</span> Lenny, then amended this to say that only Lucas could grant prior approval. It also vacillated on whether such prior approval had to be in writing. There is some force in the defendants’ submission that FAC appeared to be tailoring its case to meet points raised by them. For example, at the hearing of the striking-out application before the Assistant Registrar, the defendants pointed out that the requirement of Lucas’ “prior written approval” in the SOC (the version current at that time was SOC (Amendment No 2)) was inconsistent with the GTCs.

</div> I cannot agree. There is nothing in s 94 to suggest that only oral agreements which come into existence at the time of the written agreement (and which contain inconsistent terms) are precluded. In any event, there is clear authority against FAC’s assertion. In <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span>, the pleaded collateral agreement was allegedly entered into <span class="font-italic">before</span> the main contract; the Court of Appeal nonetheless found (at [22]–[23]) that it would have been inconsistent with the main contract itself, and that evidence of it would therefore have been inadmissible at trial by virtue of s 94(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Evidence Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Hence, evidence of the collateral agreement is not admissible.

Nor was the collateral agreement referred to in any letter of demand prior to the filing of the SOC. FAC is essentially asking this court to draw an inference that the defendants <span class="font-italic">would have</span> entered into such a collateral agreement with FAC. This inference is supported, it claims, by two facts: first, that the monies in the FAC accounts and all the previous accounts he had held with SocGen were at all times Lucas’ money, and second, that Lenny was only added as an authorised signatory to the FAC accounts on Karen’s advice so that she could benefit from the right of survivorship.

</div> This submission fails for a number of reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 First, there is no logical connection between the ownership of monies in the FAC accounts and the question of who is authorised to give instructions to use those monies. Once the owner of the funds has agreed to put another person as an authorised signatory to the bank account, the legal consequences which flow from such a nomination have nothing to do with the alleged sole ownership of the funds. In any event, Lucas was not the beneficial owner of all the monies in the other seven accounts he had opened with SocGen, but only of the monies in six of them.

FAC’s submission is this: Lenny was named as a joint account holder of two of Lucas’ <span class="font-italic">individual accounts </span>with SocGen for the right of survivorship to operate; therefore, it follows that Lenny must similarly have been named as an authorised signatory to FAC’s <span class="font-italic">corporate account</span> for the right of survivorship to operate. However, it is not clear how the right of survivorship enters into the picture. Mr Gabriel accepted that the right of survivorship does not operate in respect of FAC’s corporate account.

</div> In other words, she knew of this alleged collateral agreement between Lucas and the defendants. There are two main assumptions underpinning FAC’s case theory that Lenny was an “ancillary” person: first, Lenny did not understand share accumulators; second, she had no authority to enter or exit transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The transcripts of Lenny’s conversations with Karen during the period of the share accumulators present an entirely different picture: they show that Lenny was actively making investment decisions in respect of the share accumulators. In fact, Lenny even regarded the FAC accounts as her own. Her active participation in the share accumulators completely contradicts the alleged collateral agreement restricting her role to only signing documents when Lucas had given prior approval. Lenny made the decisions on the share accumulators because she was, as stated in the contractual documents, permitted to authorise transactions singly. I turn now to highlight the salient extracts of the transcripts which bear out this inevitable conclusion. I should mention that the full audio recordings of these were played at the trial, quite often at Lenny’s insistence.

</div> – but giving the impression that it was her own money suggests that Lenny was not in fact an ancillary person who had no authority to transact on the FAC accounts. Certainly there would be no reason for Karen or SocGen to believe that Lenny, as a duly authorised signatory, was in fact not authorised to give instructions in respect of the FAC accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I will highlight two further difficulties raised by Lenny’s explanations at trial when she was confronted with the evidence of the transcripts. First, her constant refrain was that she and Karen were just “telling stories”. What she meant was that she was merely giving “input” and not instructions to Karen as to whether to enter or exit the share accumulators; Karen still had to obtain Lucas’ consent after getting her approval. However, not only was there no record in the transcripts of her having asked Karen to obtain, additionally, Lucas’ approval for any particular transaction, this would not have been a commercially sensible practice given that share prices are by their nature time-sensitive and therefore could have moved by the time Karen sought and obtained Lucas’ confirmation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Second, Lenny said it was Karen’s “habit” to continue asking her for instructions and that she was surprised that Karen was calling her when she should have been calling Lucas in respect of the share accumulators. However, there was nothing in the conversations that indicated any tone of surprise on her part at being called or that she had directed Karen to seek Lucas’ approval or even inquired whether Lucas had given his approval. Instead, the evidence is to the contrary. She not only readily discussed the share accumulators with Karen, but also told Karen that the FAC accounts were her “territory”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 From the transcripts, (and I should add that the transcripts Lenny was asked about at trial are only a fraction of those admitted in evidence) my clear impression is that Lenny was an informed investor who was content to manage the share accumulators on her own. She clearly exercised her authority as an authorised signatory to enter into share accumulators. This effectively gives the lie to FAC’s case that Lenny was merely an ancillary person which somehow supports the existence of a collateral agreement limiting her authority in respect of the FAC accounts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2)  Lucas was not asked directly to authorise transactions on the FAC accounts</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Share accumulators were not the only investments transacted using the FAC accounts. FAC also transacted in a wide range of other products such as commodity options, equity-linked notes, and dual currency investments. FAC is, however, not claiming that any of these transactions was unauthorised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 If there was in fact a collateral agreement that the monies in the FAC accounts could not be used without Lucas’ prior approval, and since FAC is not challenging the other transactions, it should follow that Lucas must have <span class="font-italic">directly</span> given his prior approval for these other transactions on the FAC accounts. An examination of the other transactions which were entered into using the FAC accounts reveals that this was not the case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It is clear that written<span class="font-italic"> </span>authorisation was never obtained from Lucas even for these transactions.  It is not in dispute that Lenny signed <span class="font-italic">all</span> the transaction documents for <span class="font-italic">all</span> investments of the FAC accounts. Mr Gabriel informed the court that he was not aware of any transaction document relating to the FAC accounts which bore Lucas’ signature.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The collateral agreement mandated that Lucas’ approval had to be given for any transaction on the FAC accounts, yet all of the above shows that his approval was never in fact sought, much less given, for <span class="font-italic">any</span> transaction, whether for share accumulators or other investment products. The irresistible and only feasible conclusion is that there was never any such collateral agreement. There was no restriction whatsoever on Lenny, as an authorised signatory, from entering into transactions using the monies in the FAC accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I pause here to address the first of the two matters which Mr Gabriel had raised at the striking-out application (see [30(a)]). The argument that Karen sought only Lenny’s authorisation for the share accumulators but obtained Lucas’ authorisation for all other transactions is simply unsustainable given, as I have just found, that there was no evidence that Lucas had personally given authorisation for any transaction on the FAC accounts. Quite the contrary: it was Lenny who appeared to have authorised all the transactions. The argument that Karen deliberately bypassed Lucas because she <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that Lucas would not have approved any share accumulator is plainly misconceived as Lucas admitted that there was no evidence of any conversation in which he had informed Karen not to enter into share accumulators.

FAC received numerous confirmations of the share accumulators. Lucas would have had ample opportunities to object to the share accumulators on the ground that the defendants had breached the collateral agreement in not seeking his prior approval. Yet, the first time Lucas raised any objection was on 15 February 2008, when he claimed in a letter to SocGen that all the share accumulators “were entered into without [his] knowledge or consent”.

The confirmation sheets contained the following provision: “Unless we hear from you within 7 days from the above date, this transaction is deemed to be true and accurate”. The monthly statements of accounts contained entries of the share accumulators. Each page of the monthly statements contained a similar provision: “Unless you notify us within 14 days after delivery of the statement, all the entries in this statement will be deemed to be complete, accurate, conclusive and binding on you”. The importance of checking the monthly statements, in particular, must have been known to FAC when it first opened the corporate account: Clause 32.1 of the GTCs provided that FAC was to examine all statements of accounts and notify SocGen of any “unauthorised transaction(s)” within 14 days, failing which the transactions would be “binding and conclusive”, no claim on the grounds of “lack of authority” being admissible thereafter.

</div> I find Lucas’ explanation incredible, to say the least. Given the volume of the confirmations and statements sent to FAC over a fairly long period of time, it is unbelievable that an educated and commercially astute person like Lucas would not have bothered to check any of these financial documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Even assuming that Lucas did not check any of the confirmations or monthly statements, it is hard to believe that Lucas was completely unaware of any of the share accumulators Lenny had entered into. As mentioned, Lenny entered into a variety of other investment products using the FAC accounts. Lucas has not claimed that he was unaware of these transactions. He admitted that he did talk to Lenny about some of the transactions on the FAC accounts.

</div> This explanation is self-serving and I reject it. There is no conceivable reason why Lucas would be aware of all the other transactions <span class="font-italic">except</span> those relating to share accumulators. It is difficult to believe that Lenny would not have mentioned the share accumulators to Lucas when profits were made. And on this point, I note that there are in evidence fax transmissions from Karen to FAC, all of which were sent in February 2007, informing it of the profit it had made from the sale of shares acquired through share accumulators.

The facts relied on by FAC do not, as it has contended, <span class="font-italic">remotely </span>support the inference that the collateral agreement existed. The objective circumstances confirm that the collateral agreement did not and could not have existed. The inescapable conclusion is that there was simply no collateral agreement between FAC and the defendants that the latter could only transact on the FAC accounts with Lucas’ prior approval. The collateral agreement was conjured up by FAC to disclaim the share accumulators which it was obviously bound by. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendants misrepresented to Lenny that Lucas had given prior approval for the share accumulators</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As mentioned (at [28(a)] above), this claim in misrepresentation was introduced belatedly, just two months before the trial. It was not mentioned in any complaint to FAC or in any of the earlier versions of the SOC. In addition, FAC initially claimed that the misrepresentation was in June 2007, then changed its mind and said it was in June 2006. Therefore, this claim has to be viewed with a degree of scepticism. It must also be viewed with caution given that FAC is accusing Karen of having made such misrepresentations fraudulently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In any case, FAC’s claim on this misrepresentation is untenable. Mr Gabriel accepted in closing submissions that the existence of the collateral agreement is foundational to this misrepresentation. If there were no collateral agreement that the defendants could only act with Lucas’ prior approval, there would be no reason for the defendants to misrepresent that Lucas had already given prior approval when asking Lenny to sign off on the share accumulators. Since I have found that no collateral agreement existed, it is therefore improbable that any such misrepresentation was made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Given this finding, there is no need to consider whether SocGen is vicariously liable for Karen’s purported misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Lenny had not in fact provided prior oral authorisation of the share accumulators </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 FAC has not pleaded that the share accumulators are unauthorised because Lenny did not provide prior <span class="font-italic">oral</span> authorisation despite having signed the written term sheets. Its case has always been that Lenny authorised all the share accumulators in question, but that her authorisation should have no legal effect either because Lucas’ prior approval had not been sought, or because her authorisation had been procured by misrepresentation. While FAC insists that it has pleaded it, the paragraphs in the SOC it has referred to do not mention anywhere that Lenny had not orally authorised any of the share accumulators. Curiously, FAC claimed that the following sentence in the SOC supports its case: “[FAC] avers that the Defendants had used such monies deposited in the Account as well as such shares and/or assets, for transactions unauthorised by [FAC]”.

</div> In short, even if Karen had placed any order without Lenny having first given oral authorisation, FAC would still be bound since Lenny gave written confirmation by signing the term sheets. It is not in dispute that Lenny signed all the term sheets. I would add that this puts to rest the second of the two points which Mr Gabriel relied on to persuade me to allow the striking-out appeal (see [30(b)] above). Although some share accumulators may have been executed even before the term sheets were sent to Lenny for her signature, her signature on the term sheets confirms that they were in fact authorised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It is convenient now to deal also with the point that only the signature page was faxed over by SocGen. Counsel for Karen, Mr Kenneth Koh, demonstrated at trial in Karen’s re-examination that this could not have happened. The term sheets for each share accumulator would have had a time stamp at the top left of the signing page as well as an indication on the top right of the number of pages that had been faxed over.

</div> There is no reason to suppose that the same was not done for all the term sheets and FAC did not suggest otherwise in its closing submissions. Lenny’s practice was, however, to fax back only the last page of the term sheet bearing her signature to SocGen. The document that Mr Gabriel relied on at the striking-out appeal to suggest that SocGen only faxed the term sheets to Lenny after the share accumulator had been entered into was the last page of a term sheet for a share accumulator (City Development Ltd). The trade date was 18 October 2006 but the term sheet was faxed to Lenny on 30 October 2006. However, the signature page has a marker at the top right hand corner which shows that six pages were faxed over.

In <span class="font-italic">Nitine</span><span class="font-italic"> Jantilal v BNP Paribas Wealth Management</span> [2012] SGHC 28, Choo Han Teck J found that the fact that the bank could not deal with the customer’s assets as it wished but had to act on the latter’s instructions was a point against finding any fiduciary obligation (at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Second, the contractual documents clearly excluded the possibility of a fiduciary relationship arising between FAC and the defendants.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 For undue influence to be presumed, two things must be shown: first, that the complainant reposed trust and confidence in the other party or the other party acquired ascendancy over the complainant; and second, that the transaction is not readily explicable by the relationship of the parties (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland plc v </span><span class="font-italic">Etridge (No 2)</span> [2002] 2 AC 773 (“<span class="font-italic">Etridge</span>”) at [21], applied in <span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [28]). I would stress that the complainant must have reposed trust and confidence “in relation to the management of the complainant’s financial affairs” (<span class="font-italic">Etridge</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [14]). If the complainant is able to establish these two points, undue influence is presumed and the burden falls on the wrongdoer to rebut the presumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In certain established categories, the relationship of trust and confidence is presumed, leaving only the question of whether there is a transaction which calls for an explanation. Those categories would include that of parent and child, doctor and patient, lawyer and client, and so on (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Law of </span><span class="font-italic">Contract</span>”) at para 12.143); it has been said that “the relation of banker and customer will not normally meet this criterion”, though exceptionally it may (<span class="font-italic">Etridge</span> at [10]). No argument was made that the relationship of trust and confidence should be presumed in this particular banker-customer relationship. The burden therefore falls on FAC to prove, as a first step, that Lenny placed trust and confidence in Karen in relation to the management of FAC’s financial affairs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85  In my view, FAC has not discharged its burden. It is important to bear in mind that not any kind of relationship where there is “trust and confidence” would suffice for the vitiating factor of undue influence to operate (<span class="font-italic">Susilawati</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [29]). Undue influence is generally concerned with those relationships where improper pressure is not overtly applied but exists by virtue of the nature of the parties’ relationship (<span class="font-italic">Law of Contract </span>at para 12.096). There is no easy way to define the essence of such relationships, but they generally would involve “trust and confidence, reliance, dependence or vulnerability on the one hand and ascendancy, domination or control on the other” (<span class="font-italic">Etridge</span> at [11]).  I do not think the relationship between Lenny and Karen was anywhere close to such a nature. It is not in doubt that Lenny and Lucas had a close relationship with Karen, who, as their relationship manager, even attended to their personal needs such as assisting them to obtain permanent residence in Singapore.

</div> That does not, however, mean that Lenny reposed trust in Karen in relation to the management of her (or more accurately, FAC’s) financial affairs, or, put another way, that Karen had acquired ascendancy over Lenny such that she was able to improperly pressure her into executing share accumulators. As mentioned earlier (at [55]–[57]), the transcripts of their conversations show that Lenny knew what share accumulators were and was actively involved in the decisions to purchase them; on occasion, she even disregarded Karen’s recommendations.

There is no evidence, apart from Lucas’ assertion, that Karen represented the monies as having been “safe”. In any event, to say that money in an account is “safe” is far too vague a statement to be able to constitute an actionable misrepresentation; nor is it clear how there could be reliance on such a statement in the context of an investment advisory account in which there was obviously a possibility that monies would be used for (and thus potentially lost on) transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 According to Lucas, the monies in the FAC accounts had to be kept “safe” in two senses: (a) the monies in the accounts “were not to be invested or transacted in any way unless specific approval [had been] given by [him]”; and (b) the defendants were “not to invest in any risky products”.

FAC only pleaded that Karen misrepresented the monies as being safe when they were in fact being used for highly-risky share accumulators (see [24] above). In any event, there would be no reason to make this misrepresentation unless there was some agreement that Karen was not to approach Lenny to sign off on any transaction. This misrepresentation is premised on FAC’s case on the collateral agreement, on which I have found against FAC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The misrepresentation in the second sense is flawed. It could not have been the case that the monies in the FAC accounts were not to be invested in any risky product. It is a fact that FAC invested in shares, foreign exchange, gold, and even foreign exchange accumulators using the FAC accounts. Lucas accepted that these were risky products, though he claimed that the risks on these transactions were “calculated”, whereas the risk on share accumulators was not so.

The request for bifurcation was only made on the eve of trial, and hence, much work had already been carried out by the parties in relation to the quantum of FAC’s losses. In all the circumstances, I fix costs on an indemnity basis in the sums of $400,000 and $375,000 to SocGen and Karen respectively, with reasonable disbursements, to be taxed if not agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Steven Chong <br/>Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gabriel Peter, Low Hui Lin, Roxanne and Tan Yingxian, Selwyn (Gabriel Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br/>Nair Suresh Sukumaran and Tan Tse Hsien, Bryan (Advocatus Law LLP) for the first defendant;<br/>Koh Tee Huck Kenneth (Unilegal LLC) for the second defendant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-center">______________________________</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
