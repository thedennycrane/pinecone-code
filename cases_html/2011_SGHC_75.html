<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, United Bunkering &amp; Trading
                    (Asia) Pte Ltd (“UBT”), applied for leave under s 299 of the
                    Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Act”) to
                    continue with its <em>in rem</em> action against the
                    defendant, the owner of the <em>Oriental Baltic</em> (the
                    “Vessel”), Oriental MES Logistics Pte Ltd (“OML”),
                    which is being wound up. UBT’s application was opposed by the intervener,
                    Posh Maritime Pte Ltd (“PMP”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In November 2009, PT Sarana Kelola Investa,
                    which had instituted Admiralty in Rem No 328 of 2009 (“ADM 328”)
                    against, OML, arrested the Vessel in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       UBT, which had then not instituted any action
                    against OML, filed a caveat against the release of the Vessel on 25 May
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 23 July 2010, PMP, which had instituted
                    Admiralty in Rem No 92 of 2010 (“ADM 92”) against OML, was
                    given leave to intervene in ADM 328.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 7 September 2010, OML’s directors
                    resolved to wind up the company as it could not continue with its business
                    because of its liabilities. The winding up of OML commenced on 8 September 2010
                    at around 10.18 am. Mr Farooq Ahmad Mann and Mr Ewe Pang Kooi of M/s
                    Ewe Loke &amp; Partners were appointed as the company’s provisional
                    liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After the liquidation of OML commenced, UBT
                    instituted its <em>in rem</em> action against OML on the
                    afternoon of 8 September 2010 at around 2.25 pm. UBT claimed that OML owed
                    it US$183,106.84, as well as contractual interest, for the supply of marine gas
                    oil in November and December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 15 October 2010, the Vessel was sold by
                    the Sheriff and the proceeds of sale, which amounted to $403,000, were paid into
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 25 October 2010, PMP obtained judgment
                    in ADM 92. On 26 November 2010, it applied for the determination of
                    priorities and payment out of the proceeds of sale of the Vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 1 February 2011, UBT’s application
                    for leave to continue with its <em>in rem</em> action was
                    heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether leave should be given to UBT to continue with its
                action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Section 299(2) of the Act, which concerns
                    legal proceedings where the winding up of a company has commenced,
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After the commencement of the winding up no action or proceeding shall be
                        proceeded with or commenced against the company except by leave of the Court
                        and subject to such terms as the Court imposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Obviously UBT wanted leave to continue with
                    its action in order to obtain judgment and stake a claim for a share of the
                    proceeds of sale of the Vessel. As UBT’s claim potentially competed with
                    that of PMP, the latter intervened in the present proceedings and strenuously
                    argued that UBT’s application for leave should be rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Whether leave to continue with admiralty
                        <em>in rem</em> proceedings after the owner of the
                    vessel has gone into liquidation must be considered very carefully because of
                    the effect of such proceedings on other creditors of the company. In an
                    oft-cited case, <em>In re Aro Co Ltd</em>
                        (“<em>Re Aro</em>”)
                    [1980] Ch 196, Brightman LJ explained at 207H-208C:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The usual object of suing in rem is to obtain security. The plaintiff
                        becomes entitled upon the institution of his suit to the arrest and
                        detention of the subject matter … and on adjudication in his favour
                        to a sale and satisfaction of his judgment out of the net proceeds thereof,
                        subject to other claims ranking in priority to or pari passu with his own.
                        So stated, the rights of a plaintiff suing in rem have points of similarity
                        with the rights of a legal or equitable mortgagee or chargee….</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The main problem faced by UBT in its
                    application for leave to continue with its action against OML was that its
                        <em>in rem</em> action was instituted <em>after</em> the winding up of OML had commenced. There are two
                    approaches which may be taken when considering whether or not leave should be
                    granted under s 299(2) of the Act to UBT to continue with its action. The
                    first approach focuses on whether or not an applicant for such leave is a
                    secured creditor. In <em>The Hull 308</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R)
                    643, the Court of Appeal, relying on <em>Re Aro</em>,
                    reiterated at [10] that the proper test
                    for determining whether the plaintiffs in any given case are secured creditors
                    is to ask whether immediately before the presentation of the winding-up
                    petition, they could assert against all the world that the vessel was security
                    for their claim. While <em>The Hull 308</em> was concerned
                    with an application for leave under s 262(3) of the Act which applies to
                    compulsory winding up, the principles enunciated in that case are applicable to
                    s 299(2) of the Act, which governs voluntary winding up and is <em>in pari materia</em> with s 262(3) of the Act.
                    Evidently, UBT was in no position at the material time to assert against the
                    whole world that the Vessel was security for its claim as it had not instituted
                        <em>in rem</em> proceedings against the owners of the
                    Vessel. That being the case, it should not be allowed to continue with its
                    suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     An alternative approach outlined by Brightman
                    LJ in <em>Re Aro</em> was also adopted by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>The Hull 308</em>. It is that the
                    court’s power to grant leave to continue the action is not dependent on
                    whether the applicant for leave is a secured creditor and the court’s task
                    is to do what is right and fair in the circumstances. That was why in <em>Re Aro</em>, leave was granted to continue an <em>in rem</em> action even though the writ was instituted but
                    not served before the commencement of the liquidation of the
                defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     While the courts have allowed a plaintiff who
                    instituted an <em>in rem</em> action before the
                    commencement of liquidation of the shipowner to continue with the action even
                    though the writ had not been served by that date, the position is different
                    where an <em>in rem</em> action is instituted <em>after</em> the commencement of liquidation. In <em>The Hull 308</em>, the plaintiff, who supplied equipment and
                    engines for the construction of the defendant shipowner’s vessel, started
                    an <em>in rem</em> action one month after the commencement
                    of the liquidation of the defendant. LP Thean JA explained (at [14]) as follows why the plaintiff should not
                    be allowed to continue with its action:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Following the alternative broad approach adopted by Brightman LJ and doing
                        what is right and fair in the circumstances we do not think that in this
                        case the discretion under […the Act] should be exercised in favour of
                        the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs immediately before the commencement of
                        winding up of the defendants had no security over the vessel, and <em>should leave in such circumstances be granted, it would confer
                            upon the plaintiffs a security on an asset of the defendants which the
                            plaintiffs otherwise did not have and could not have</em>.
                            <em>That would be unfair to the other unsecured
                            creditors</em>. The primary object of the winding up provisions of
                        the Act, as held by Lindley LJ in <em>In re Oak Pits Colliery
                            Co</em> (1882) 21 Ch D 322 at 329, is to put all unsecured
                        creditors upon an equality and to pay them <em>pari
                            passu</em>; ….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     UBT contended that while it had not issued a
                    writ before the commencement of liquidation proceedings against OML, the fact
                    that it had filed a caveat against release before that date should be taken into
                    account. However, a caveat against release does not establish the
                    caveator’s status <em>vis-à-vis</em> a vessel in the
                    way that the issue of a writ does. In <em>Re Aro</em>,
                    Brightman LJ stated at 211 that such status is established by the issue of
                    the writ. In my view, on the basis of the alternative approach outlined by
                    Brightman LJ, it would not be right and fair in the circumstances to allow
                    UBT to continue with its action against OML as that would be most unfair to
                    OML’s other creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     For the reasons stated, UBT’s
                    application for leave to continue with its action was dismissed.</p>
