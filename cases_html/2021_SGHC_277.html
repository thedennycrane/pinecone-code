</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The “Duration” in cl 6 did not refer to the duration of the completion of the Subcontract works. This is because the dates in cl 6 are actually the completion dates for the main contract between SCB and the plaintiff (the “SCB-ZK contract”), and not the Subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It is absurd to say that the completion date between the main contractor SCB and the subcontractor plaintiff, would be the same as that between the plaintiff and the sub-subcontractor defendant. The plaintiff was responsible to SCB for multiple phases of the Project, not just Phase 1 and Phase 2A. The completion date given by the SCB to the plaintiff should hence be later than that given by the plaintiff to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Nothing in cl 6, read purposively, circumscribes the starting date for calculating LD to begin only after 16 March 2018 for Phase 1 and only after 29 December 2017 for Phase 2A. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) This is reinforced by cl 4 which states that the commencement of the Subcontract is with immediate effect, which the plaintiff asserts is 7 November 2016, the date of the Subcontract. Even on the defendant’s case that the Subcontract was effected only sometime in December 2016, the duration in cl 6, which starts from 16 June 2016, is inconsistent with an actual start date of December 2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Moreover, cl 4 states that the “completion date” shall be no later than the dates stated therein in cl 4. The “Duration” in cl 6 ends later than the cl 4 dates and are inconsistent with them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In effect, the plaintiff is relying on cl 6 to impose LD, at the rates stated in cl 6 for each phase, but submitting that the dates stated in cl 6 should be ignored and the dates in cl 4 should be applied instead for determining when LD begins to apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I do not find the plaintiff’s arguments on this to be persuasive for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff submits that the dates in cl 6 should be ignored. But there is nothing in cl 6 that says that the dates in cl 6 should be disregarded and that the dates in cl 4 apply instead to determine LD.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff submits that the dates in cl 6 actually refer to the contractual completion dates between SCB and the plaintiff. But there is nothing in cl 6 that states that the duration of works there refers to the SCB-ZK contractual completion dates. In fact, there is no mention of the SCB-ZK contract anywhere in the Subcontract. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Moreover, the plaintiff has chosen not to adduce the SCB-ZK contract. There is therefore no evidence of the scope of works between them, or the completion dates for any of the phases of work that the plaintiff is responsible to SCB for. What was adduced, following cross-examination of Mr Gan by counsel for the defendant, is a one-page document which the plaintiff states is an extract from the SCB-ZK contract. This states that for the purposes of LD, the completion date is 29 December 2017 for Phase 2A and the completion date is 16 March 2018 for Phase 1.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In other words, on the plaintiff’s evidence, the dates in the Subcontract under cl 6 for Phase 2A and Phase 1 are exactly the same as the LD dates in the SCB-ZK contract. There is nothing irrational about such an arrangement. Indeed, aligning the dates at which LD would start, would allow the plaintiff to potentially claim LD from its subcontractor, the defendant, during the same period that it is liable to its main contractor, SCB, for LD. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) A plain reading of cl 6 and cl 4, indicates that the relevant dates for assessing LD are those found in cl 6, rather than those in cl 4. Clause 6 is titled “Liquidated and Ascertained Damages”. The quantum for LD per day is found in cl 6 and not cl 4. The plaintiff is seeking to impose LD pursuant to cl 6, not cl 4. To disregard the dates in cl 6 and apply the dates in cl 4 to assess LD would render the dates in cl 6 otiose, and is not supported by the plain wording of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) This does not render the Subcontract inconsistent. As a clause for LD, cl 6 has no impact on the commencement date of the Subcontract. That the duration in cl 6 has a different start date from the actual start date of the contract, is immaterial to the issue of LD, as LD is counted from the end date of the stated duration and not the start date. Neither is it inconsistent with cl 4 which states that the completion of the Subcontract is no later than the dates stated therein. In effect, the defendant is to comply with the Master Programme and complete the Project no later than the dates stated in cl 4. Where the defendant fails to do so, the plaintiff may, for example, seek to claim for general damages arising from late completion based on the dates in cl 4. But the imposition of a fixed daily quantum in the form of LD, will only take effect after the dates stated in cl 6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The defendant also submits that pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">contra proferent</span><span class="font-italic">em</span> rule, the ambiguity in the Subcontract should be interpreted against the plaintiff, who drafted the Subcontract. There were negotiations that led to changes in the quantum of the LD imposed under cl 6 of the Subcontract, but the plaintiff did not amend the completion dates therein or resolve any conflict between cl 4 and cl 6. As the plaintiff are now seeking to rely on cl 6 to make the claim of LD, they “should stand or fall on this clause which very clearly spells out the completion dates”.

Mere difficulty in interpretation, without more, does not immediately trigger the application of the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem</span> rule. For the reasons stated above, the ambiguity here can be resolved by applying an interpretation that fits the context of the contract. Hence, my view is that the <span class="font-italic">contra proferent</span><span class="font-italic">em </span>rule need not apply here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I will next consider the implication of the dates in cl 6 being the relevant dates for assessing LD. The plaintiff’s case for Phase 2A is that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the contractual or scheduled completion date is 20 February 2017 per cl 4 of the Subcontract (although para 19 of the Statement of Claim (“SOC”) states that the contractual or scheduled completion date is 15 February 2017, which is inconsistent with the date in cl 4); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the defendant was 148 days late in completing Phase 2A; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the actual completion date for Phase 2A is 15 July 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 This is an inconsistent position, since 148 days from 20 February 2017 is 18 July 2017 and not 15 July 2017. Even if the wrongly pleaded contractual completion date in the SOC of 15 February 2017 is adopted, 148 days from 15 February 2017 is 13 July 2017 and not 15 July 2017. Under cross-examination, Ms Chai Yoke Choo (“Ms Chai”), the contracts manager for the plaintiff, affirmed that the plaintiffs are maintaining that the actual completion date for Phase 2A is 15 July 2017.

Second, the plaintiff also did not adduce any other evidence that works were completed on 30 September 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I note that the evidence is clear that the Subcontract works for Phase 1 were uncompleted when the defendant abandoned the works on 6 June 2018 and that as of 30 June 2018, such works were still not completed. Following the abandonment of works, the parties had engaged in correspondence, and by a letter dated 30 June 2018, the plaintiff informed the defendant that they would need to engage third parties to complete the remaining works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In so far as 30 September 2018  being the operative date from which LD begins, I note that the plaintiff did plead 30 September 2018 as the actual completion date for Phase 1 at para 19(1) of the SOC. In relation to whether there is evidentiary support for this, I note that there was no certification from SCB, CAAS or SJ that works were completed at that point. However, while certification from SCB, CAAS or SJ as to the completion of works would have tidied up this issue more neatly, it is also undisputed that there were works remaining when the defendant abandoned the work site on 6 June 2018. This included the installation of the glass panels, which was one of the biggest parts of the defendant’s work scope, and which in turn required the use of mobile cranes to install. Mr Rethna Balan Rajeesh (“Mr Rajeesh”) of the defendant admitted that the installation of 13 pieces of glass was outstanding.

</div> Taking into consideration the totality of the surrounding evidence, I accept Ms Chai’s testimony that 30 September 2018 was used as the completion date as that was the last date for the mobile crane work for the glass installation. Ms Chai was a credible witness, who acknowledged defects in the plaintiff’s case where they arose, and I saw no reason to disbelieve her on this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As explained above, it is the completion date in cl 6 that is applicable to the calculation of LD. The calculations for LD for Phase 1 should therefore start after 16 March 2018. Taking the actual completion date for Phase 1 of 30 September 2018, this would be 198 days of delay. As the LD quantum for Phase 1 under cl 6 is at $1,800 per day, the total LD that the plaintiff would be entitled to for Phase 1 would be $356,400.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In summary, the plaintiff is not entitled to LD for Phase 2A.

This principle should similarly apply where the LD clause is found to be inapplicable as opposed to unenforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Given my finding that LD does not apply for Phase 2A, I next considered whether the plaintiff may still be awarded general damages arising from late completion in Phase 2A. There were two difficulties here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, the plaintiff’s assertion that 20 July 2017 was the actual completion date for Phase 2A is based on ambiguous evidential grounds. In the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions, the plaintiff states that 20 July 2017 is chosen because Dembicon, an external subcontractor, completed the removal of rockwool in July 2017.

</div> There is nothing from the plaintiff’s witnesses, whether in their AEICs or oral testimony, that explains why 20 July 2017 was the actual completion date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The plaintiff seized on a line in the defendant’s closing submissions at para 95(c)(i) that states that the “installation and alignment of the metal claddings for the Annex Building were completed even earlier in July 2017, prior to the inspection, verification, and confirmation by Mr Joseph Lugtu.” The plaintiff submits that from this, the defendant admits that the installation and alignment for the Annex Building were completed in July 2017. However, the defendant’s submission on this was not in relation to the completion date for Phase 2A, for which the defendant’s general position was that “[t]he number of days of alleged delay are contrived at worst or arbitrarily derived, at best, by [the plaintiff]”.

</div> Rather the defendant’s point was made in relation to whether the plaintiff could claim for rectification works relating to the realignment of the panels after removal of the rockwool. This is clear from the reference made by the defendant in that part of their submission to Mr Rajeesh’s AEIC at pp 163–166, which contains his notes to this effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In addition, there is a second and fundamental difficulty, as there were no details provided as to actual losses that the plaintiff had suffered due to the alleged delays caused by the defendant in Phase 2A, beyond the delay works claimed for by the plaintiff. <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span>”) at para 18/12/13 states that particulars need not be given for general damages, but where the damage suffered is of a kind which is not the necessary and immediate consequence of the wrongful act, full particulars must be provided to show the nature and extent of the damages. This is so that the defendant would be fairly informed of the case to be met and to aid in computing the amount of damages to be paid. The mere statement or prayer for a claim of “damages” would not suffice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The plaintiff, in its SOC, had claimed $340,233.10 for replacement and rectification of defective works. But beyond this, there are no particulars as to what losses the plaintiff is claiming for in respect of the delays. For example, there is no mention of how much LD the plaintiff had to pay SCB as a result of the delays and whether such LD was in fact paid. All that was prayed for was for “damages to be assessed”. This is clearly insufficient in providing notice to the defendant of the case that it has to meet, especially when such losses are not the necessary and immediate consequence of the delay. The lack of particularity in pleading is compounded by the lack of any evidence on the losses suffered, beyond the rectification and repair works claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I therefore find that the plaintiff is not entitled to any damages for alleged delays caused by the defendant for Phase 2A works. I will next consider the other two main issues under this claim, namely whether the period for LD should be reduced due to alleged delays by the plaintiff, and whether the LD is unenforceable for being a penalty.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Were there justifiable reasons for the delay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The defendant submits that the delay, if any, was caused by the plaintiff. First, the plaintiff’s refusal to pay the defendant their lawful and due payments resulted in the plaintiff’s repudiatory breach of the Subcontract. The defendant had no choice but to accept the plaintiff’s repudiatory breach and terminate the Subcontract, which led to any or all delays. Second, the plaintiff failed to give clear and timely instructions to the defendant.

The rationale for this, the court explained, was that “the existence of such a right [to suspend work upon the other party’s failure to make payment] could create chaos within the building industry if contractors were to muscle their way through disputes with threats or actual threats or suspension instead of having their disputes adjudicated” (at [57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 On 30 May 2018, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff demanding payment of $149,436.99 by 12.00pm on 5 June 2018 (see above at [13]–[14]). In that letter, the defendant referred to three items, but it is not clear on the face of the letter how their respective quantum adds up to $149,436.99.

Accordingly, on 5 June 2018, the defendant accepted the plaintiff’s repudiatory breach and terminated the Subcontract on the ground of non-payment for work completed.

</div> Thus, neither was there any issue of non-payment from the plaintiff to the defendant for the procurement of the three pieces of the mock-up glass. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Furthermore, out of the three items listed as adding up to the demanded $149,436.99, two substantial items, the 13 pieces of balance glass and its sea freight costs, are clearly within the scope of the defendant’s work under the Subcontract and are not VOs. As of 30 May 2018, the defendant had not delivered on this. In fact, the defendant was unable to produce any documentary evidence that as of 30 May 2018, it had already ordered the 13 pieces of balance glass.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In other words, in the defendant’s letter of 30 May 2018, it threatened to terminate the contract, not because of earlier instances of alleged non-payment, but because the plaintiff would not pay them in advance for work that the defendant had not completed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">DGE v ZK</span> at [96], there is no general right at common law to suspend work unless this is expressly agreed upon. This is so even if payment is wrongly withheld. However, there may be instances in which a persistent course of payment delays, or a protracted delay in the payment of a very substantial sum amounts to a repudiation of the contract. In this case though, the defendant’s ultimatum was delivered not on the ground of a persistent course of payment delays. Rather,  the ultimatum in effect was that the defendant will terminate the Subcontract if the plaintiff did not provide advance payment for work yet to be done by the defendant and for which the plaintiff had already agreed to prepay to third party vendors supplying some of the key materials for the defendant’s works. That is clearly not a basis for the defendant to treat the Subcontract as repudiated by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In any event, the defendant has not shown that the plaintiff had persistently withheld payments unreasonably, through a “persistent course of payment delays or a protracted delay in the payment of a very substantial amount” as per <span class="font-italic">Al Stainless Industries Pte Ltd v Wei Sin Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2001] SGHC at [194]. Prior progress claims were not fully rejected but certified for lower sums. It is undisputed that the plaintiff has substantially paid on the amounts that were certified. The defendant invoiced on the amount of $344,263.72 and the plaintiff made payments of $339.136.06. The Provisional Sum indicated in the Subcontract was $558,055. At para 16 of her AEIC, Ms Emily Javier of the defendant provided a summary of the amounts claimed by the defendant and paid by the plaintiff. This was updated at para 50 of the Defendant’s Closing Submission to reflect the correct breakdown, with a slight reduction in the VO amount. The defendant’s position was that the total amount payable by the plaintiff was $623,770.55, with $561,019.90 being the value of work done in the main contract and $62,750.65 being VOs. On the defendant’s calculations, the plaintiff had paid on 54% of their claims. In addition, the plaintiff also provided the defendant with three interest-free loans, totalling $110,000, to ease the defendant’s cashflow problems. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the amounts that were uncertified, the quantum was disputed by the plaintiff.

</div> the defendant claimed for $40,960 for 80% work done for “W7 – 2040mm x 2700mm Full Height Cabin Glass”. At that stage of works, three out of the 16 pieces of cabin glass had been installed but one piece had cracked. The plaintiff certified for 12% of the work done, on the basis of two out of 16 pieces installed. On the evidence, I find that this was justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 On the whole, I find that the defendant has not proven that the works in the payment claims were consistently under-certified by the plaintiff. Mr Rajeesh’s AEIC at pp 8–10 sets out what he states as “evidence … that works have been duly completed” by the defendant. At para 9(b)(ix) this includes a photograph of 16 pieces of the cabin glass for the eight-storey equipment building. But Mr Rajeesh also admitted on the stand that the installation of the 13 pieces of cabin glass was outstanding when the defendant abandoned works on 5 June 2018. The evidence is that the 13 pieces of cabin glass were only delivered by SSG on site on 14 and 16 July 2018, well after the defendant abandoned the works on 5 June 2018.

</div> The plaintiff explained that in PC 9, the defendant made a claim for 25% of work done for aluminium cladding with insulation. The plaintiff had certified this as 0% of work done as such works had been omitted earlier when the defendant submitted as-built drawings that did not include such insulation works. In PC 10, the defendant reverted to stating that there was 0% of work done for this.

</div> For aluminium cladding without installation, the defendant claimed for 40% work done. The plaintiff certified 50% for Elevation 1, 10% for Elevation 3 and 10% for Elevation 4, on the basis that the runner, bracket and L-angle were not completed by the defendant. In the absence of further evidence, it cannot be said that on the balance of probabilities, the plaintiff unreasonably under-certified and withheld payment in respect of this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Despite the presence of disputes over the certification, there is no evidence that the defendant sought to have such disputed quantum adjudicated, for example through the SOPA procedures. This is despite its progress claims having received lower certification since August 2017. Instead on 30 May 2018, the defendant took the very drastic step of issuing an ultimatum that it be paid $149,436.99 by 5 June 2018, followed by its abandoning of works on 6 June 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 None of the affidavits filed by the defendant’s witnesses explained why the defendant took this very sudden and drastic step. When asked about this, Mr Kesavan s/o Sathyamoorthy (“Mr Kesavan”), the director of the defendant, said that the defendant then had payroll issues, it had to take on high interest loans, it could not make the interest payments and its variation requests were not being honoured.

</div> In other words, it appears that the defendant was then having cashflow difficulties, which may have made it difficult for the defendant to order the remaining 13 pieces of balance glass without receiving monies from the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The defendant subsequently sought adjudication through SOPA in October 2019, seeking the sum of $264,789.08. The AD was issued on 15 November 2019 for the sum of $197,522.83, out of which $136.579.13 related to main works claimed and $60,943.70 related to VOs. For the reasons set out later when I deal with the plaintiff’s submission that the AD be set aside, three of the VOs allowed in the AD are to be set aside. On the whole, the defendant was successful in slightly over half of its claims in the AD. Pertinently, the AD proceeded on the basis of PC 17 and did not examine in detail the alleged under-certification in the PCs before this. The AD cannot hence be regarded as the basis for finding that the plaintiff engaged in a persistent course of payment delays.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77  Assessing the evidence in totality, I find that the defendant has not shown that there was a persistent course of payment delays that justified the defendant’s repudiation of the Subcontract. Accordingly, I find that it is the defendant that wrongfully terminated the Subcontract. There is therefore no basis for the defendant to reduce the period of delay on account of alleged repudiatory breach by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was there delay from the plaintiff’s failure to give timely and clear instructions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The defendant also submits that SCB and the plaintiff committed “acts of prevention” which prevented the defendant from completing the works on time: <span class="font-italic">Lian </span><span class="font-italic">Soon Construction Pte Ltd Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 518 at [18].

Saint-Gobain glass is not in the pool of approved manufacturers under Tender Corrigendum No 4. SJ quickly rejected this in an email dated 13 September 2017, noting that the Saint-Gobain glass did not meet the contract specifications. This was followed up by the issuance of SOI 13 by SJ to SCB on 27 September 2017, stating that in the event the visual mock-up is rejected by CAAS, SCB is to revert to the previously approved SSG glass without delay. SCB informs the defendant of SOI 13 on the same day and asks for a warranty letter from them that if Saint-Gobain glass is rejected by CAAS, the defendant will proceed with the previously approved SSG glass. The defendant later explained on 17 January 2018, that they had recommended Saint-Gobain glass in September 2017 “due to the overwhelming cost of complying with the designated type of glass required by CAAS plus the number of panels”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 On 25 October 2017, the defendant issued a letter of assurance stating that if the newly proposed Saint-Gobain glass was not accepted, they would proceed with the previously approved SSG glass. In a letter dated 13 November 2017, SCB informed the defendant that the tests show that Saint-Gobain glass is not equivalent to the previously approved SSG glass in terms of reflectance levels. By then, the defendant should have known that Saint-Gobain glass would not be approved. There is, however, no evidence that they started work then on procuring the SSG glass. The rejection of Saint-Gobain Glass is reiterated by SJ on 29 December 2017, in their email to SCB copying the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On 9 January 2018, the defendant emailed SCB and the plaintiff to state that they discovered that CAAS did not want the SSG glass which had a centre mullion. This is quickly responded to by SJ, who in their email of 12 January 2018, continued to firmly reject Saint-Gobain glass. They also informed that they have concurrently liaised with SSG, who informed SJ that minor adjustments can be made to the SSG glass to allow for larger glass panels of equivalent glass performance, without a centre mullion. The glass lead time and cost remain unchanged. SJ emphasised that time is of essence, that much time had been lost reviewing the alternative cabin glass proposal and asked for the submission of a catch-up schedule. On 27 January 2018, SJ sent another email informing that they have not received the schedule for the glass. The defendant acknowledged SJ’s request in their reply on 29 January 2018. There is no documentary evidence that the defendant did provide SJ with such a catch-up schedule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The defendant submits that there were two types of SSG glass panels that were approved, with different specifications, what they term as SSG-1 which was approved by SJ on 28 July 2017 and SSG-2 which was approved by SJ on 30 January 2018.

Nor was there any delay in instructions from the relevant parties to the defendant to proceed with SSG glass.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 On the contrary, Saint-Gobain glass was proposed by the defendant in September 2017 due to the “overwhelming costs” for them. Despite clear indications from SJ to proceed with SSG glass on 13 November 2017 and 29 December 2017 and later on 12 January 2018, to proceed with the modified SSG glass, the defendants showed no signs of doing so. In fact, an email from SCB dated 17 April 2018 shows that as of that date, the defendant had still not placed any order for the modified SSG glass.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The defendant’s only explanation for this delay was the plaintiff’s alleged non-payment. But they have not explained why that justifies their delay in ordering the SSG glass. As set out above, there were disputes over the amounts certified in the defendant’s progress claims, but the defendant has not proved that the amounts were wrongly certified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In relation to Phase 1 and the installation of the glass, the defendant also submits that CAAS had by a letter from SJ dated 24 April 2018, informed SCB that the completion date was extended to before 1 July 2018 and on that basis, the operative date for LD for Phase 1 to be imposed on the defendant should be after this date.

</div> and the relevant correspondence leading up to this letter, reveals that this is a letter from SJ to SCB, and not from the plaintiff to the defendant. Moreover, what SJ indicated to SCB was simply that SCB was not to delay any further and should complete the installation of glass panels before July 2018. The letter also states at paragraph (e) that there “shall be no claims for Extension of Time and/or additional cost arising from this SOI”. The letter does not state that SJ would change the completion date for SCB, and it certainly does not state that the plaintiff would change the LD start date of the defendant to after 1 July 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The defendant has also submitted that the plaintiff’s delay in securing the BCA permit contributed to the defendant’s delay. This is not borne out by the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 First, I find that there is no ambiguity as to who was to make the BCA submission, contrary to the defendant’s submission that by failing to specify who was responsible to make the BCA submission, the plaintiff had effectively borne the risk of any delay which may result because of the ambiguity.

</div> In respect of Phase 1, the BCA permit was secured around January/February 2018. Pertinently, a large part of the delay related to the delay in procuring and installing the glass. However, the defendant had yet to order the glass by April 2018, even though the BCA permit for Phase 1 was secured in January/February 2018 and SJ informed them by 27 January 2018 that the Saint-Gobain glass was rejected and that they were to proceed with the modified SSG glass. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The defendant also submitted that there were delays caused by the plaintiff because of the plaintiff’s delay in approving the sealant for the rockwool. This issue also arises in the defendant’s counterclaim in VO DV0006, for $32,602.50 to supply labour to dismantle aluminium panels with rockwool and reinstall the aluminium panels. For the reasons stated when I deal with DV0006 later (see below at [235]), I find no evidence that the plaintiff caused any delay when executing its role in relation to the sealant for the rockwool.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In its closing submissions, the defendant also alluded to the plaintiff’s delay in getting instructions from SCB or CAAS on colour code.

</div> But in that same exchange, Ms Chai also explained that the colour code was chosen by SJ or CAAS. There was no delay from the plaintiff in getting instructions from SJ or CAAS on the colour code. She also explained that the colour code only applied to the panels and before the panels could be installed, the defendants had to do works relating to the brackets and runners. Even at that stage, there were serious issues concerning the lack of manpower to do the bracket and runner works. I hence find no merit to the defendant’s submission on delay in relation to the colour code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 On the whole, I find no merit to the defendant’s submission that the delay period should be reduced because of the plaintiff’s alleged failure to give timely or clear instructions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Is the LD quantum in cl 6 of the Subcontract a penalty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The defendant submits that the LD quantum is not enforceable because it is not a genuine pre-estimate of loss and is a penalty. The thrust of their submission on this, is that the plaintiff “could not show [the defendant] any proper calculation of their genuine pre-estimate of losses when [the defendant] asked [the plaintiff] to substantiate the amounts. Accordingly, it appears that this sum was an arbitrary value” that was plucked from another contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In <span class="font-italic">Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Seraya Energy Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2021] 1 SLR 631 (“<span class="font-italic">Denka Advantech</span>”) at [254], the Court of Appeal held that a clause will be a penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach, such that the sum stipulated for is not a genuine pre-estimate of the likely loss (<span class="font-italic">Denka Advantech</span> at [185]).

Mr Rasanathan claims that during the negotiations of the Subcontract, he attended a meeting at the plaintiff’s office, and told Ms Chai that the amount in cl 6 was excessive. Ms Chai, however, replied that this merely reflected the LD clause under the SCB-ZK contract. Mr Rasanathan claims that although they felt the proposed $1,800 per day for Phase 1 in the Subcontract was excessive, they had little choice but to go along with this.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In other words, the Subcontract LD is about 60% of the SCB-ZK contract LD. Given that the plaintiff has other subcontractors and the defendant’s failure, in and of itself, could potentially trigger the higher amount of LD owing by the plaintiff to SCB, I find that the Subcontract LD quantum is not extravagant and unconscionable compared to the greatest loss that can be proved to have followed from a breach of the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In their closing submission, the defendant also submits that SCB’s evidence that there was LD due by the plaintiff to SCB is unreliable. They submit that SCB were acting in concert with the plaintiff. The LD quantum between SCB and the plaintiff was not pleaded earlier because it would expose SCB as a party with economic motivations to testify in favour of the plaintiff, as SCB cannot collect the LD from the plaintiff unless they collected this amount from the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 While this was a theme that the defendant pursued at the trial, they have not proved it on the evidence. In their testimonies in court, both SCB witnesses, Mr Gan King Ann and Mr Lu Zhi testified in their capacity as the main contractor for the project. Their testimony was not favourable to the defendant, as they spoke of the delays of the defendant, but they did so with reference to contemporaneous written correspondence from SCB to the defendant about such delays. While Ms Chai did testify that the plaintiff had not paid SCB the LD owed to SCB yet, the defendant has not surfaced any evidence that SCB were in collusion with the plaintiff. The defendant relies in the main on the plaintiff awarding a $9.6m contract to the plaintiff despite the plaintiff’s paid up capital being only $300,000. However, Mr Gan testified that that in the construction industry they normally work by trust of performance, that SCB had worked with the plaintiff previously, and this was the third project that SCB had with the plaintiff.

In addition, if the party in breach intends to contend that the claimant has failed to act reasonably in mitigating damages, notice of such an assertion ought to be pleaded. In assessing the reasonableness of the claimant’s conduct, the court will take cognisance of the fact that the claimant is “not bound to nurse the interests of [the party in breach]” but, at the same time, it cannot disregard the defaulting party’s interests. When a duty to mitigate arises, the standard of reasonableness to be applied to the decision of the innocent party is not a high one. The fact that the damages claimed substantially exceed the contractual price is, by itself, not a valid objection. In <span class="font-italic">Jia Min</span>, the court found that given the urgency of the situation, the defendant’s engagement of certain other contractors and some of its workers was reasonable. The court noted that it “will not audit every decision made in the turmoil of a difficult and fluid commercial situation” (<span class="font-italic">Jia Min</span> at [73]). The plaintiff there had contended that the defendant ought to have tendered for quotes, but the court noted that it is trite law that a claimant will not be disentitled to recovery merely because the party in breach can suggest other measures less burdensome to him that might have been taken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I fully agree with the analysis set out in <span class="font-italic">Jia Min</span>. In this case, besides the fact that the defendant did not plead that the plaintiff failed to act reasonably in mitigating losses, the defendant has not discharged the burden of proving that losses have not been mitigated properly. The defendant’s submission is not even that the prices in the claims are excessive, but rather, that the plaintiff has not shown a process through which they obtained the most competitive quote. At most, the defendant is suggesting that the plaintiff should have sought other quotations before deciding on the contractor, and there  may be a <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> of a less costly option. The defendant did not in fact show that there was a less costly option. However, as was pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Jia Min</span>, a claimant, which is the plaintiff here, is not disentitled to its recovery of costs merely because the defendant can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken. The burden of proving that the loss has not been mitigated lies squarely on the defendant, but the defendant has not surfaced evidence that any of the claims are excessive. I hence find no merit to the defendant’s submission in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a 15% administration charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Most of the plaintiff’s claims for replacement and rectification of defective works in the table at para 104 of Ms Chai’s AEIC included a 15% administration charge.

Before I do so, I will address a more general point regarding the applicability of the 15% administration charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The plaintiff’s position is that since it had to engage third parties to supply materials or to carry out works on behalf of the defendant, it was entitled to the 15% administration charge.

Given that cl 12.2 of the Subcontract imposes a flat charge, it should be read within the confines of its natural wording. There is no evidence of requests made by the defendant in respect of the claims for which the plaintiff seeks to impose the 15% administrative charge. Neither were the charges to be deducted from the defendant’s progress claims.

This states that the subcontractor “shall be allowed to use … mobile crane on site.

Such reservation of right to allocate, would allow the main contractor to allocate the use of the cranage between the main contractor’s workers or any of the subcontractors. The existence of such reservation of right to allocate to the main contractor, clearly denotes that Item 6.1 of Annex B of the Subcontract did not intend to impose an obligation on the main contractor to provide access to the subcontractor, in the form of mobile cranes.

There is no explanation of why the invoice is described with reference to “Samsung Koh Brother JV’s gate entrance”. More importantly, in contrast to the documentation for Item 1(a), where an examination of the documents reveals sufficient linkages to the work of the defendants such that the naming of the project name as “Serangoon” should only be regarded as a typo, the documentation here do not assist in showing the relationship between the invoice and the defendant’s work. Neither was there evidence from the plaintiff’s witnesses, through their AEICs or on the stand, about how these documents relate to the specific claim. The only thing that was said came through the plaintiff counsel’s cross-examination of Mr Rajeesh, where the plaintiff’s counsel stated that the crane was hired to carry out works belonging to the defendant in the period before the defendant walked out because the defendant was behind schedule.

This was not pleaded or attested to by any of their witnesses in their AEICs or at trial. Neither is it consistent with the defendant’s position as set out in the documentary evidence. SJ had given the defendant notice to install SSG-2 glass as early as 27 January 2018, before they abandoned the work site on 6 June 2018, but never at any point prior to the abandonment of works, did the defendant give any indication that they did not agree to install SSG-2 glass and would only do so if it was approved as a VO. In an email dated 17 January 2018 from the defendant, the defendant explained that sometime in September 2017, they had recommended Saint-Gobain glass “due to [the] overwhelming costs of complying with the designated type of glass required by CAAS plus the number of panels”. In other words, the issue of the higher than anticipated cost of the glass had already surfaced in September 2017, before SSG-2 was even in contemplation. The defendant did not ask for a VO then but instead recommended the Saint-Gobain glass as an alternative to deal with the costs issue. It is also notable that SJ in their email dated 27 January 2018

From the evidence, three of such pieces would be delivered first, and serve as a mock-up. There are separate claims by the plaintiff for the remaining 13 pieces of glass. Hence, the total number of pieces of glass claimed for by the plaintiff is for 16 pieces (characterised by the plaintiff as three pieces of mock-up glass and 13 pieces of balance glass), which the defendant does not dispute they were obliged to provide under the Subcontract. The three pieces of glass falls under the defendant’s obligation. The defendant’s position is that it is willing to pay for this claim, but not the 15% administrative charge as the plaintiff only secured this material on the defendant’s behalf because the plaintiff did not pay the defendant its dues.

</div> SSG also observed that delay breakage is possible, that is, the crack could appear “after a period of time” from impact. SSG concluded in its report that “[t]he breakage was probably caused by edge damage from an impact to the outer, lower edge of laminated glass of IGU before or during installation.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The SSG report is equivocal in its finding. It acknowledges that the impact could have been caused before the installation with the crack showing up only later or it could have been caused during installation.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 The defendant submits that the plaintiff has not adduced evidence to show how the AD was erroneous. The plaintiff did not make reference to its Adjudication Response and show how the AD was erroneous in how the Adjudication Response and Adjudication Application were considered. Consequently, the plaintiff has not satisfied that on a balance of probabilities, that the AD was wrongly determined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 I note that the SOC at para 20 states that “the Plaintiff pleads to and fully disputes the Adjudicated Amount of S$197,522.83.” At paras 127–141 of her AEIC, Ms Chai sets out her views on parts of PC 17, which was the subject matter of the AD. However, these points do not reference the AD at all and it is not clear from them that she is raising the points in support of the plaintiff’s contestation of the main works awarded under the AD. Moreover, the section of her AEIC entitled “The Adjudication Determination was Wrongly Made in Respect of the Disputed Payment Claims Allowed by the Adjudicator”, makes no mention of the plaintiff’s positions <span class="font-italic">viz</span> the main works awarded under the AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 In any event, leaving aside the lack of reference to the AD at paras 127–141 of Ms Chai’s AEIC, the points made therein also do not address the adjudicator’s reasons for his decisions in the AD:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At para 127 of Ms Chai’s AEIC, she states that the plaintiff only certified 80% of the amount claimed by the defendant for the R3 Tower Equipment Building external façade system without insulation as there were defects which were not rectified. This appears to relate to Item B2 of the AD. At [93]–[94] of the AD, the adjudicator found that the plaintiff had not produced any evidence of the costs of rectification of such defects nor satisfactorily explained why the plaintiff certified only 80%, which appears to be an arbitrary estimate. Nothing in para 127 of Ms Chai’s AEIC addresses these points of the adjudicator. There is only a bare assertion that there were “[d]efects, including alignment issues, [that] were found and were not rectified by the [d]efendant”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At para 128 of Ms Chai’s AEIC, she states that the plaintiff disputed the defendant’s claim for Annex Building façade system works with insulation as they had omitted the insulation works. This appears to relate to Items A1, A4 and A6 of the AD. After examining the parties’ positions at the adjudication, the adjudicator found at [61]–[62] of the AD that the rockwool insulation had been installed, but the plaintiff apparently rejected it due to poor workmanship, while the defendant disputed that and alleged that any damage to the insulation was due to the plaintiff’s delay in approving the sealant. The adjudicator went on at [69] of the AD to state that “what is not disputed is that the [defendant] did carry out the dismantling of the panels with rockwool insulation …” In other words, the adjudicator found that while there was a dispute over the workmanship of the insulation, the insulation itself was not omitted. It was installed and the defendant did carry out work to remove it. The adjudicator then awarded a combined sum of $139,636.90 for the aluminum cladding work, with and without cladding. Paragraph 128 of Ms Chai’s AEIC does not address the adjudicator’s reasons for his award.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At paras 129–137 of Ms Chai’s AEIC, she states the plaintiff’s position on the dispute over the site measurements for the aluminum cladding works. She states that the Subcontract is not a measurement contract and the quantity claimable is not based on actual measurement of quantity. Under cl 2 of the Subcontract, the Subcontract Sum was not subject to adjustment except for variations agreed to by the Principal and/or its representative. The plaintiff also denied that there was an agreement, set out in a handwritten note in the Site Measurement Document, which stated that “[a]s per agreed before signing of contract, DGE can claim any excess of quantity from the original contract quantity”. Also, the plaintiff’s position was that Joseph did not have the capacity to approve the quantity of works carried out by the defendant. In the AD at [65], the adjudicator found that the Site Measurement Document signed by Joseph and a representative of the defendant constitutes “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence that the claimed quantity of 810.92m2 had been carried out and … approved by a third party”. The adjudicator noted that there was a contrary response quantity of 761.88m2 which was said to be based on plan only, but the adjudicator found that there was no evidence before him that the response quantity of 761.88m2 had been agreed to between the parties. Again, Ms Chai’s AEIC does not deal with the adjudicator’s reasons for his decision. In fact, there is nothing in Ms Chai’s AEIC about the lack of evidence for the “response quantity of 761.88m2” or why the handwritten note should be ignored. The plaintiff’s case that Joseph did not have authority to approve the quantity of works carried out by the defendant, is also severely undermined by Ms Chai’s admission that Joseph was “the archi [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>coordinator of the main contractor, so I believe that he would be able to sign the documents.” She testified that she saw Joseph also sign the final measurements and that “because he is the main contractor’s coordinator, so he can sign any document.”

Two examples alone, do not suffice to explain why the plaintiff certified no sum payable at all for the works relating to metal claddings, doors and windows. In any event, the two examples also do not assist the plaintiff. One example is the door (GD1) for R3 Tower Equipment Building which the plaintiff certified 50% out of 100% claimed because the door had defects. The adjudicator awarded 70% of the claim for this, as he did not find it fair to withhold 50% after noting the nature of the defect, This is at paras 125–126 of the AD. Nothing in Ms Chai’s AEIC addresses why the 70% awarded by the adjudicator was wrong. The other example given is certifying 12% out of 100% claimed for the glass panels as only two out of 16 panels had been installed. However, this example is not helpful to the plaintiff’s case as that was also the adjudicator’s decision at para 108 of the AD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Beyond this, none of the plaintiff witnesses testified, in their AEICs or on the stand, on why the main works awarded under the AD should be overturned.

</div> do not assist, as they relate to the plaintiff’s submission that they did not under-certify the payment claims and that hence there was no basis for the defendant’s submission that there was a persistent course of payment delay. The plaintiff does not relate the submissions on the payment claims to the parts of the AD which the plaintiff is contesting, and the submissions certainly contain no specific response to the adjudicator’s reasons for his award in the AD. Moreover, where portions of the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions do touch on areas dealt with under the AD, the explanations came through counsel rather than the plaintiff’s witnesses. As the plaintiff is the party seeking to set aside the AD, the burden is on the plaintiff to provide such evidence through the witnesses. This was not done. Consequently, the defendant did not have a chance to contest this during the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 I therefore dismiss the plaintiff’s claim for overturning the main works allowed by the adjudicator in the AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 In contrast, Ms Chai testified much more specifically on the plaintiff’s position regarding the error made by the adjudicator in awarding the VOs in the AD, at paras 146–165 of her AEIC. There was specific reference to para 71 of the AD, an explanation of the plaintiff’s position that the adjudicator had erred in applying cl 2 of the Subcontract, and the plaintiff’s position on the various disputed VOs awarded under the AD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 In respect of the VOs, the Adjudicator correctly cites cl 2 of the Subcontract and states that the variations under the Subcontract must be agreed, at para 71 of the AD.

</div> However, cl 2 also states that such agreement must come from the Principal or the representative of the Principal, which is defined in cl 1 as “CAAS” and “SJ” respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 The Adjudicator does not identify where there has been agreement from CAAS or SJ. Instead, he concludes at para 72 of the AD: “In this case, I have found that there is no specific requirement in the LOA that the variation order must be in writing, although the Claimant did submit a written Variation Order Request, which was not signed or accepted by the Respondent.”

</div> The respondent in the AD was the plaintiff. The Adjudicator thus focused on whether there was agreement by the plaintiff, when the requirement is agreement by CAAS or SJ. There is no evidence of such agreement by CAAS or SJ for the VOs in dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 This affects the following VO claims under the AD, which will be set aside on the basis that there was no agreement from CAAS or SJ as required under cl 2 of the Subcontract:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) VO DV0006 for reinstallation of rockwool totalling $32,602.50;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) VO DV0008 for airfreight charges totalling $13,185;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) VO DV00018 for the BCA submission totalling $5,070.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 As the above VOs form part of the defendant’s counterclaim for VOs, their merits will be dealt with there.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Counterclaim 1: Four VOs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 As a general point, details are lacking in the pleadings for the four VOs claimed by the defendant in this suit. Out of the $65,849.45 disputed in the four VOs, I allow the claim for VO DV0008 for the BCA submission of $5,070 and dismiss the other three VO claims. The detailed reasons are set out below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">VO DV0006</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 DV0006 is the defendant’s VO claim for $32,602.50 to supply labour to dismantle aluminium panels with rockwool and reinstall and align the aluminium panels. The defendant submits that there was prolonged delay on the plaintiff’s part in approving the sealant, which led to the rockwool insulation being damaged. The defendant submitted the sealant type for approval by the plaintiff on 3 January 2017. The defendant also sent an email to the plaintiff on 2 March 2017 stating that the defendant urged the plaintiff to approve the sealant type, as the rockwool could become damaged without a sealant, the defendant had applied a temporary seal in the meantime, and the defendant would claim costs of any works for removing the damaged insulation as a variation work. The architect only confirmed the sealant to be applied on 24 March 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 The plaintiff submits that CAAS being the employer for the Project had the authority and control over approval of the sealant to be used for the Subcontract works. It was therefore out of the control or work authority of the plaintiff to approve the sealant proposed by the defendant. The relevant issue was not the alleged delay in approval of sealant, but the work measures that the defendant had to take to protect the rockwool installed pending the sealant approval. While awaiting the approval of the sealant, the defendant must ensure that the rockwool would not be exposed or subjected to damage, including water ingress that would damage the rockwool already installed. However, the defendant did not.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 I disallow the defendant’s claim for this VO. As acknowledged by Mr Rasanathan of the defendant, approval for the sealant came from CAAS / SJ. The plaintiff’s role was to seek the approval on behalf of the defendant and convey the approval. There is no evidence that the plaintiff delayed when executing its role. As the installer, the onus is on the defendant to provide the necessary temporary protection for the rockwool. The sealant was approved on 24 March 2017. The defendant has not provided evidence that the time taken to approve the sealant was inordinate for such works. They have not, for example, shown that the temporary seal applied was not expected to last for the relevant duration, where it was properly applied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">VO DV0008</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 DV0008 is the defendant’s VO’s claim for $13,185 for the airfreight charges for three pieces of the Saint-Gobain glass for mock-up. The defendant’s case is that the plaintiff agreed to bear this cost.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 The plaintiff’s position is that it is part of the scope of works of the defendant to procure delivery of mock-up glass. Further or alternatively, the freight costs claimed by the defendant were costs that were indispensably necessary to bring to completion the installation of the mock-up glass. In any event, any agreement to pay for the costs of freight was subject to the plaintiff’s condition that the Annex Building metal cladding works, including removal of the rockwool, were completed and handed over to the plaintiff and the main contractor.

The plaintiff’s agreement to pay for the airfreight charges was clearly conditional on the Annex Building metal cladding works (including removal of the rockwool) being completely done and handed over to SCB and the plaintiff.

The defendant’s case is that the Subcontract clearly excludes submissions to relevant authorities, including BCA, from the defendant’s scope of works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 The plaintiff’s position is that Annex B of the Subcontract stated that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant was contractually obliged to make submissions to the relevant authorities, including BCA. Documentary evidence shows the defendant directly acting upon SCB’s request to make submissions to BCA, bypassing the plaintiff. The plaintiff is hence not obliged to pay the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 I allow this VO claim. While it was SCB that made the request to the defendant, the plaintiff was aware of such a request and did not object. In effect, they acquiesced to the request from SCB for the defendant to do the BCA submission. By analogy, if SJ gave instructions to the defendant on the execution of works under the SC, the plaintiff has not (and rightfully so) said that such instructions are unrelated to the Subcontract works simply because it was SJ and not the plaintiff that gave the instructions. The BCA submission was related to the work under the Subcontract between the plaintiff and the defendant. I find that the defendant is hence entitled to claim this VO from the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">VO DV00019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 DV00019 is the defendant’s VO claim for $14,991.95 for the cost for the supply of labour for rope access to install the mock-up cabin glass. The defendant’s case is that the defendant merely suggested and brought in Saint-Gobain glass at its own costs for the glass panels only, on instructions from the plaintiff for testing. The defendant was not obliged to provide actual sized mock-up samples, and only much smaller glass panels.

</div> The plaintiff was the party that demanded that the defendant erect the mock-up of the Saint-Gobain glass for approval by CAAS. This cost should hence be borne by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 The plaintiff denies this amount. At all material times, the plaintiff did not agree, orally or in writing, to pay for the alleged charges for supply of labour of rope access for the mock-up cabin glass. Further or in any event, cl 2 of the Subcontract states that the Subcontract Sum is inclusive of all ancillary works “indispensably necessary to carry out and bring to completion the Subcontract works”. Any supply of labour for rope access for the mock-up cabin glass was indispensably necessary to carry out and bring to completion the works for the mock-up cabin glass, which works were necessary for the mock-up samples required before bulk fabrication of the glass. This was clearly set out as part of the technical specifications in the Tender Corrigendum No 4.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 I disallow this VO claim. As set out above at [85], the defendant was keen to have CAAS and SJ accept Saint-Gobain glass as the alternative, as this would help with the defendant’s costs concerns with the SSG glass. On their own case, the defendant brought in Saint-Gobain mock-up glass at their own costs. The installation of the Saint-Gobain glass was part of the process of securing CAAS and SJ’s approval through the viewing of the mock-up glass. The defendant has not provided any evidence of agreement by the plaintiff, CAAS or SJ to pay for the supply of labour for rope access for the installation of the mock-up glass. While it was alleged that there was an oral agreement, the defendant was unable to provide particulars of who, when or what was said for such oral agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Counterclaim 2: Defendant’s claim for remainder of the contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 The defendant also counterclaims for the remainder of the contract value of $561,019.90 excluding payments received of $339,136.60, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $297,819.49. This includes the four disputed VOs (see above at [230]), amounting to $65,849.45, which have been dealt with above. Part of this remainder involves the 5% Retention Sum, which I will deal with below as a separate item.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">5% Retention Sum of $28,051</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246  In respect of the Retention Sum of 5%, amounting to $28,051, the defendant has failed to provide the warranties and indemnities as applied to the Subcontract works, which is a condition precedent to the release of 5% of the Retention Sum, as set out in cl 5 of the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 The defendant submits that they are not obliged to provide such warranties and indemnities because of the plaintiff’s repudiatory breach. In view of my finding that it was the defendant who committed the repudiatory breach by unjustifiably abandoning works, that defence fails. Hence, the defendant is not entitled to 5% of the Retention Sum, for failure to provide warranties and indemnities as required under cl 5 of the Subcontract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 The next question is whether the defendant is entitled to the remainder, after excluding the 5% Retention Sum and the four disputed VOs, amounting to $127,982.85. The basis of the defendant’s claim for the remainder is that they are entitled because the plaintiff had breached the contract by creating a persistent course of payment delays, entitling the defendant to terminate the contract.

</div> for the same reason, I find that the defendant is not entitled to general damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Counterclaim 3: Is the defendant entitled to the legal costs associated with the AD?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 The defendant has claimed for damages in the form of the legal costs associated with the AD, where a sum of $197,522.83 was awarded to the defendant. This is on the basis that but for the plaintiff’s breach of the contract, the defendant would not have taken up the adjudication application. Section 30(4) of SOPA provides as follows:</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs of adjudication proceedings</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">30.</span> — (4) A party to an adjudication shall bear all other costs and expenses incurred as a result of or in relation to the adjudication, but may include the whole or any part thereof in any claim for costs in any proceeding before a court or tribunal or in any other dispute resolution proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 Section 30(4) of SOPA thus allows a party in principle to recover the costs of an adjudication application as damages under s 30(4) of the SOPA. In <span class="font-italic">GA Engineering Pte Ltd v Sun Moon Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2020] SGHC 167, the court accepted the operation of s 30(4) of the SOPA but did not allow a defendant to claim the costs of an adjudication as it did not successfully defend all of the plaintiff’s claims. As I have allowed for three of the VOs awarded to the defendant under the AD to be overturned, the amount that the defendant would be entitled to under the AD would be $146,647.33 ($197,522.83 less $50,875.5) out of the claimed amount of $264,789.08. In other words, the defendant was unsuccessful in respect of close to half the amount claimed in the adjudication application. Thus, this is not an appropriate case for the defendant to be awarded the legal costs associated with the adjudication application, as part of damages. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 In conclusion, I allow the plaintiff’s claims for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) LD for Phase 1 in the amount of $356,400;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Replacement and rectification works in the amount of $197,501.49; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The three VOs in the AD to be overturned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 I allow the defendant’s counterclaim for VO in DV00018 in the amount of $5,070.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 I will hear parties on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kris Chew Yee Fong and Su Hongling Isabel </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Zenith Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Luo Ling Ling and Sharifah Nabilah binte Syed Omar </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">(Luo Ling Ling LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
