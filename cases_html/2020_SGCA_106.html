The entire appeal centred on various aspects and/or applications of the doctrine of consideration. We dismissed the appeal and now give the detailed grounds for our decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Amongst all the doctrines of the common law of contract in the Commonwealth, perhaps the most academic ink has been spilt on the doctrine of consideration. Yet, modern cases at least that involve the invocation of the doctrine are few and far between. This is one of the rare decisions in the Singapore context; the last major decision, the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Gay </span><span class="font-italic">Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 (“<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>”), was handed down over a decade ago. Viewed from a <span class="font-italic">practical </span>perspective, this is not surprising. As we shall see, the existing case law renders it relatively easy to demonstrate the presence of valid or sufficient consideration in practice. On an <span class="font-italic">academic</span> level, though, it is understandable why there is a continued fascination with the doctrine. Its historical roots continue to remain obscure (for a very perceptive and recent essay from historical as well as comparative points of view, see Susan Kiefel, “The Doctrine of Consideration in Contract: Some Historical and Comparative Perspectives” in <span class="font-italic">Contract in Commercial Law </span>(Simone Degeling, James Edelman and James Goudkamp gen eds) (Lawbook Co, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Contract in Commercial Law</span>”) at Ch 4), and its very existence continues to be a topic of fascination amongst legal academics – particularly whether it ought to be superseded by other contractual doctrines. Significantly, though, the burgeoning literature on the doctrine has brought us no nearer to a solution on an academic level. For this reason alone, it is inadvisable for courts to enter the various debates (interesting though they may be on the academic plane), particularly when the practical yield is so paltry. Indeed, this is the approach that this court adopted in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>, this court decided that the doctrine of consideration continued to be part of the Singapore contractual landscape. That case related, on its <span class="font-italic">facts</span>, to the operation of the doctrine in so far as the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">formation</span> of contracts was concerned. The present appeal raises, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a different issue as to whether the doctrine of consideration ought nevertheless to continue to operate in so far as the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> or modification</span> of contracts is concerned (indeed, this was an <span class="font-italic">additional</span> argument which was not canvassed in the court below but which the appellant raised in the present appeal (and which itself raised a procedural question which will be dealt with below)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Although the observations in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>were <span class="font-italic">general</span> in nature <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and</span> the case itself endorsed the leading decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Williams v Roffey Bros</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd </span>[1991] 1 QB 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Williams</span>”) (which confirmed the need for consideration in respect of the <span class="font-italic">variation </span>of an existing contract in a situation where it was sought by the promisee to enforce a promise to <span class="font-italic">pay more</span>, albeit in a more “dilute” form), given the fact that <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span> related, strictly speaking, to the operation of the doctrine of consideration in relation to the <span class="font-italic">formation </span>(as opposed to a <span class="font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-italic"> or modification</span>) of the contract concerned, it could be argued that the issue as to whether consideration is required for the <span class="font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-italic"> or modification </span>of an existing contract has <span class="font-italic">not</span> been (at least wholly) foreclosed in the Singapore context.<span class="font-italic"> </span>As we shall see, there is some case law and (not surprisingly) academic writing that suggests that the doctrine ought to be dispensed with in the latter situation,<span class="font-italic"> viz</span>, the <span class="font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-italic"> or modification</span> of contracts. However, this would, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, entail <span class="font-italic">departing from </span>not only <span class="font-italic">Williams </span>but also the longstanding House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic">Foakes</span><span class="font-italic"> v Beer </span>(1884) 9 App Cas 605 (“<span class="font-italic">Foakes</span>”) (which held that consideration was required in a situation where it was sought by the promisee to enforce a promise to <span class="font-italic">take less</span>).<span class="font-italic"> </span>We will touch briefly on this particular legal issue below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In addition to the issue of the doctrine of consideration in the context of the variation or modification of contracts, there was also a procedural issue in the court below that centred on the relevant test to apply upon a submission of no case to answer. That procedure and substance have an integrated and symbiotic relationship with each other cannot be denied (see the decision of the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Huat Foundations Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 425, especially at [8]). Although this particular issue was not raised in the present appeal, we will nevertheless make some observations on it as it has general significance beyond this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 So much by way of preliminary observations. Let us now turn to the background and the decision of the court below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The appellant in this appeal, Mdm Ma Hongjin, is an investor. The respondent, SCP Holdings Pte Ltd, is an investment holding company, and the ultimate holding company of a group of companies known as the Biomax Group. The respondent owns and controls Biomax Holdings Pte Ltd (“Biomax Holdings”), which in turn owns and controls Biomax Technologies Pte Ltd (“Biomax Technologies”). Biomax Technologies was the second defendant in the trial below, but was not named as a party to the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The dispute between the parties arose out of a convertible loan of S$5m extended by the appellant to the respondent pursuant to a Convertible Loan Agreement (“the CLA”) dated 6 January 2015. While the appellant was the investor on record, the CLA was negotiated by Mr Han Jianpeng (“Mr Han”), the appellant’s husband, and Mr Sim Eng Tong (“Mr Sim”), the controlling shareholder of the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Under cl 3 of the CLA, the S$5m loan was extended for a period of two years. In return, the respondent would have to pay interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The interest was to be paid in two instalments: the first interest payment of S$500,000 was due on 5 January 2016 and the second interest payment of the same amount was due on 5 January 2017 together with repayment of the principal, making a total of S$5.5m payable on that date. Additionally, the appellant was granted an option to require the respondent to procure a transfer of 15% of the shares in Biomax Holdings to her in lieu of paying the sum of S$5.5m due on 5 January 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Although the CLA provided that the whole of the loan amount (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$5m) was to be disbursed on the date of the CLA (see cl 2.2), the sum of S$5m was in fact disbursed to the respondent in three tranches on the following dates:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) S$2.5m on 6 January 2015;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) S$1m on 14 January 2015; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) S$1.5m on 30 March 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Within two months of entering into the CLA, the appellant and Mr Han became unhappy with the respondent’s financial results. This caused Mr Han to re-negotiate some of the terms of the CLA with Mr Sim sometime in March 2015. This resulted in the appellant and the respondent entering into the “Supplemental Agreement relating to a S$5,000,000 Convertible Loan Agreement Dated 6 January 2015” (“the SA”) on 16 April 2015. The two recitals to the SA provided that it was “supplemental to” the CLA, and that the appellant had agreed to amend the CLA to the extent set out in the SA at the respondent’s request.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The SA essentially imposed additional obligations on the respondent by stipulating several amendments to the CLA. First, the proportion of Biomax Holdings shares in respect of which the appellant could exercise a call option on 5 January 2017 increased from 15% to 20%. Second, the SA imposed an additional “lump sum facility fee” of S$250,000 to be paid on the same day as the first interest payment (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 January 2016). These amendments were to take effect on 16 April 2015. Notably, the appellant did not assume any additional obligations to the respondent under the terms of the SA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 There were a number of other transactions which the appellant was involved in which were of relevance to the appeal. Shortly after entering into the SA on 16 April 2015, the appellant entered into a Share Investment Agreement with Biomax Technologies (“the SIA”) under which she agreed to extend a loan of not more than S$5m to Biomax Technologies for the purpose of setting up a recycling plant, though the loan facility under the SIA was eventually not disbursed. The appellant also separately extended a number of loans totalling S$6m to Biomax Technologies between June and October 2015 (“the June to October 2015 loan agreements”). Of these, only S$1m was eventually repaid by Biomax Technologies to the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In January 2016, the respondent made payment of S$500,000 but neglected to pay the S$250,000 facility fee which was provided for under the SA. The appellant thus commenced proceedings in Suit No 765 of 2016 (from which the present appeal arose) to obtain payment of the facility fee from the respondent and repayment of the outstanding loans and interest from Biomax Technologies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Two further points bear mentioning before we turn to the Judge’s decision. First, there was no appeal against the Judge’s decision in respect of the appellant’s claims against Biomax Technologies. Second, the appellant had commenced a separate suit against the respondent following its failure to repay the sum of S$5.5m due on 5 January 2017. These points were irrelevant to the present appeal and thus do not feature any further in these grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Although the respondent had initially pleaded a number of defences against the appellant’s claim for the unpaid facility fee, it chose to abandon all defences prior to the trial save one – that the SA was unsupported by consideration and was therefore unenforceable. The respondent also advanced the technical argument that the appellant had failed to state in her pleadings that the SA was supported by consideration. As against this, the appellant made three arguments: (a) first, the SA and CLA were part of “one and the same contract”, and cl 9.3 of the CLA dispensed with the need for consideration for contractual variation; (b) second, the CLA and the SA should be treated as part of the same transaction with the disbursement of the loans under the CLA (both before and around the time that the SA was entered into) being consideration for the respondent’s agreement to pay the facility fee; and (c) third, that consideration was furnished by way of a factual or practical benefit in the form of goodwill from the appellant for future loans to the respondent or any of its related entities. Following the close of the appellant’s case in the proceedings below, the respondent made a submission of no case to answer coupled with the usual election not to call evidence if the submission failed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge found that the SA was unenforceable as it was not supported by consideration. The Judge first considered the appropriate test to apply in civil cases following a defendant’s submission of no case to answer. The Judge rejected the appellant’s submission that she only had to prove a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case in order to succeed on her claim, finding instead that she had to prove her case on a balance of probabilities. The Judge reasoned that, following the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span><span class="font-italic"> v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters </span>[2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>”), a defendant who elects to make a submission of no case to answer <span class="font-italic">must</span> make an accompanying election not to call evidence in the event that submission fails. As a result, there was no justification for a different standard of proof to apply in a situation where a defendant makes a submission of no case to answer as compared to one where that same defendant does not make such a submission but simply elects to call no evidence. In arriving at this decision, the Judge considered that the decision of the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">Central Bank of India v Bansal Hemant </span><span class="font-italic">Govinprasad and others and other actions </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 22 (“<span class="font-italic">Central Bank of </span><span class="font-italic">India</span>”) did not stand for the proposition that a submission of no case to answer would fail if the plaintiff was able to prove a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case. The Judge also took the view that this court’s decisions in <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">an Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd and others</span> [2012] 2 SLR 549 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Juay Pah</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Lena </span><span class="font-italic">Leowardi v Yeap Cheen Soo </span>[2015] 1 SLR 581 (“<span class="font-italic">Lena </span><span class="font-italic">Leowardi</span>”) did not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff need only prove a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case upon a submission of no case to answer, and that any statements to that effect were <span class="font-italic">obiter</span><span class="font-italic"> dicta.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Turning to the consideration issue, the Judge found that he was bound by the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span> ([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and that consideration was necessary for contractual variation. While the Judge found that the appellant had failed to adequately plead in her reply that the SA was supported by consideration in response to the respondent’s defence that the SA was “void for lack of consideration”, he considered that this did not cause any real prejudice to the respondent, preferring instead to decide the point based on whether consideration had been furnished for the SA. In this respect, the Judge rejected the arguments raised by the appellant and found that the SA was a free-standing agreement for which no consideration had been provided. First, cl 9.3 of the CLA did not allow for the contract to be varied without consideration. The decision of the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">Benlen</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Authentic Builder Pte Ltd</span> [2018] SGHC 61 (“<span class="font-italic">Benlen</span>”) cited by the appellant was distinguished on the basis that the clause considered therein was materially different. Second, the CLA and SA could not be construed as being part of a single transaction. Even on the appellant’s case, she and Mr Han did not contemplate the SA when she first entered into the CLA with the respondent. Rather, the SA was an attempt to reopen a concluded bargain and improve the appellant’s position. This distinguished the facts of the case from the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Rainforest Trading Ltd and another v State Bank of India Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2012] 2 SLR 713 (“<span class="font-italic">Rainforest Trading</span>”). Third, the SA was not supported by consideration in the form of a factual or practical benefit to the respondent. There was no evidence that the parties had engaged in negotiations and reached an in-principle agreement on the terms of the SA prior to the disbursement of the third tranche of the loan on 30 March 2015. In any event, there was no evidence that the respondent gained some benefit from the appellant’s disbursement of the third tranche of the loan under the CLA which was extrinsic to the disbursement and would bring the case within the principle in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). There was also no consideration in the form of goodwill to Mr Sim and his companies for future loans as there was no evidence that any goodwill shown by the appellant was causally connected to the respondent’s entering into the SA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The appellant did not dispute the Judge’s findings on the appropriate legal test to be applied upon a defendant’s submission of no case to answer. The appellant relied on many of the same arguments that were raised before the Judge. First, the appellant argued that cl 9.3 of the CLA dispensed with the need for fresh consideration for a variation of the CLA. Second, the appellant submitted that consideration had been furnished for the SA by way of a factual and/or practical benefit. The appellant also sought leave to argue that <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>should be overruled at least in part – to the extent that consideration would not be required in the case of contractual <span class="font-italic">variation</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The respondent’s main contention was that the Judge ought to have rejected the appellant’s case at the outset due to her failure to plead that the SA was supported by consideration. The respondent also argued that the Judge was correct in rejecting the appellant’s arguments that the SA was supported by consideration. Regarding the appellant’s application for leave to argue that <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>should be overruled in so far as contractual variation was concerned, the respondent took the position that the appellant should be precluded from doing so, and that in any event, the doctrine of consideration should be retained for contractual variations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The following issues are addressed in these grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, what is the test to be applied upon a submission of no case to answer by a defendant (“Issue 1”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, whether the appellant had adequately pleaded that the SA was supported by consideration (“Issue 2”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, whether cl 9.3 of the CLA dispensed with the need for fresh consideration for a variation of the CLA (“Issue 3”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) fourth, whether the appellant had furnished consideration for the SA by way of a factual and/or practical benefit (“Issue 4”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) fifth, whether the requirement for consideration should be dispensed with for contractual variations (“Issue 5”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1: the applicable test upon a submission of no case to answer</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As alluded to above, this particular issue (relating to the applicable test to be applied upon a submission of no case to answer by a defendant) did not really arise in the present appeal. However, as it raises an important point of general importance, and sets the context for the rest of the present discussion, we will make some general observations for guidance in future cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the court below, after the appellant had closed her case (as the plaintiff), counsel for the respondent (the defendant) made a submission of no case to answer, <span class="font-italic">coupled with</span> the usual election not to call evidence if the submission failed (such election being <span class="font-italic">obligatory</span> pursuant to the rule laid down by this court in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> ([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [70]). As we shall see, this <span class="font-italic">obligatory</span> election is a matter (or factor, rather) of the first importance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It is important, in the first instance, however, to note that, under general law, the plaintiff bears the legal burden of proving its case against the defendant in a civil case on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a balance of probabilities</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, in the situation where the defendant has made a submission of no case to answer, local case law suggests that the plaintiff need only satisfy the court that there is <span class="font-italic">a</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie </span><span class="font-italic">case</span> on each of the essential elements of the claim in order to defeat the defendant’s submission of no case to answer and secure judgment in its favour (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Central Bank of India</span> ([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [21] as well as the decisions of this court in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Juay Pah</span> ([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [37] and <span class="font-italic">Lena </span><span class="font-italic">Leowardi</span> ([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It might, at first blush, therefore, appear that in a situation where the defendant has made <span class="font-italic">a submission of no case to answer</span>, the standard of proof is different and this was indeed the view that the Judge took in the court below. He was therefore of the view that he had to choose one standard over the other (and chose the former, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, proof on a balance of probabilities). <span class="font-italic">However</span>, on closer analysis, this is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> the case and the Judge was, with respect, mistaken in thinking he had to make a choice when, in fact, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">none</span> was required. Let us elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The starting point in our analysis is the concept of the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> burden. A plaintiff in a civil claim bears the legal burden of proving the existence of any relevant fact necessary to make out its claim on a balance of probabilities (assuming, of course, that the defendant cannot prove any applicable defences). This flows from the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”), and in particular s 103, which requires that a person desiring a court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts prove that those facts exist. Though the EA does not, on its face, distinguish between the <span class="font-italic">civil </span>and <span class="font-italic">criminal</span> burdens of proof, it has long been established that the legislation retains the traditional common law distinction between the two (see the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (on appeal from the Federal Court of Malaysia) in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v</span><span class="font-italic"> P Yuvaraj </span>[1970] AC 913 at 920H–921B). Although there has been, on occasion, controversy over the possible existence of a third standard of proof, this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tang</span><span class="font-italic"> Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 at [14] clarified that there are only two such standards of proof – proof on the balance of probabilities for civil cases and proof beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 A closely related (though distinct) concept is that of the <span class="font-italic">evidential</span> burden (or tactical burden). This is borne by the person on whom the responsibility lies to “contradict, weaken or explain away the evidence that has been led” (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 (“<span class="font-italic">Britestone</span>”) at [59]). While the legal burden is determined by considering the pleadings of the parties and determining the material facts relied on by the parties to establish the legal elements of a claim or defence, the evidential burden can shift between the parties based on the state of the evidence (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve</span><span class="font-italic"> Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 63 at [30]–[31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The following passage from <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span> illustrates the operation of these concepts (at [60]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A]t the start of the plaintiff’s case, the legal burden of proving the existence of any relevant fact that the plaintiff must prove and the evidential burden of adducing some (not inherently incredible) evidence of the existence of such fact coincide. Upon adduction of that evidence, the evidential burden shifts to the defendant, as the case may be, to adduce some evidence in rebuttal. If no evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the court may conclude from the evidence of the plaintiff that the legal burden is also discharged and making a finding on the fact against the defendant. If, on the other hand, evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the evidential burden shifts back to the plaintiff. If, ultimately, the evidential burden comes to rest on the defendant, the legal burden of proof of that relevant fact would have been discharged by the plaintiff …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Crucially, a party’s establishment of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on a particular fact on which it bears the legal burden denotes the point at which the evidential burden will shift to the defendant. In the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Berger Paints Singapore Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 427, the issue was whether defects in paint supplied by a paint manufacturer caused discolouration on a building. The appellant’s evidence in that case was found to have demonstrated <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> that the defective paint was likely the cause of the discolouration, which caused the evidential burden to shift to the respondent. As the respondent adduced no evidence on this point, it was found that the appellant had proven that the discolouration was more likely than not caused by defects in the paint (at [37]–[38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 This, in our view, explains why the applicable test following a submission of no case to answer has been expressed as requiring the plaintiff to prove a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case. Where a submission of no case to answer is coupled with an election not to call evidence (which is <span class="font-italic">obligatory</span> following <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)), the establishment of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on each of the relevant facts in issue essentially results in a finding that the plaintiff has proved those facts on a balance of probabilities. This is because, following the shifting of the evidential burden to the defendant, there is simply no evidence forthcoming from the defendant to disprove the plaintiff’s position or weaken it such that the court can return a finding that the fact in issue is either “disproved” or “not proved” within the meaning of s 3 of the EA (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit v Loo Chay Loo, deceased </span>[2010] 1 SLR 286 at [20]). Seen in this light, the distinction between a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on the one hand and proof on a balance of probabilities on the other does not mean, as the parties argued below, that the court applies a laxer standard of proof in the former. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">summary</span>, the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">does</span> indeed bear the legal burden of proving its case against the defendant in a civil case on <span class="font-italic">a balance of probabilities</span>. <span class="font-italic">Where the defendant has made a submission o</span><span class="font-italic">f no case to answer</span>, <span class="font-italic">this </span>particular standard of proof is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">met or discharged</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>by the plaintiff satisfying the court that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on each of the essential elements of its claim.<span class="font-italic"> </span>This is because in a situation where the defendant has made a submission of no case to answer, such a submission <span class="font-italic">must</span> (as we have already noted at [23] above) be <span class="font-italic">coupled with</span> an election <span class="font-italic">not to call evidence</span> (pursuant to the principle laid down in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>), with the result being that if the plaintiff has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on the facts in issue (that are essential to its claim), this would <span class="font-italic">essentially </span>result in the court finding that the plaintiff has discharged its burden of proving the aforementioned facts <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on a balance of probabilities</span>. This is due to the fact that, upon the plaintiff establishing a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">case </span>with respect to the relevant facts in issue, the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">evidential </span><span class="font-italic">burden </span>will <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">shift</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the defendant</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">However</span>, because the defendant <span class="font-italic">has </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">had </span><span class="font-italic">(in the situation of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a submission of no case to answer</span><span class="font-italic">)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">to</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> elect </span><span class="font-italic">to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">call </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">no</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">evidence</span>, it <span class="font-italic">would be </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">unable </span><span class="font-italic">to adduce </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">any</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) evidence</span><span class="font-italic"> to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">either disprove</span> <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff’s position </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or</span> <span class="font-italic">weaken it such that the </span><span class="font-italic">facts that the plaintiff relies upon are “</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not proved</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>. Put another way, where a defendant elects not to call any evidence upon making a submission of no case to answer, there is simply no contrary evidence from the defendant for the court to consider. The court is only left with the evidence of the plaintiff and if, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis, the evidence satisfies all the ingredients or essential elements of the cause of action, judgment will be entered against the defendant. Because there is simply <span class="font-italic">no</span> balancing exercise of evidence to speak of, it might appear somewhat anomalous to describe the plaintiff as having proven its case on a balance of probabilities. However, such an anomaly is more apparent than real – in such a situation (concerning a submission of no case to answer), provided that it can establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case on the facts in issue (that are essential to its claim), the plaintiff has (<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">simultaneously</span>) proved its overall case on a <span class="font-italic">balance of probabilities</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 We therefore affirm that, in the situation where the defendant has submitted that it has no case to answer and has (as it legally must) also elected to call no evidence if it fails in this submission, <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff</span> would <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">succeed</span> if it can establish that it has <span class="font-italic">a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">case</span> on each of the essential elements of its claim. For the avoidance of doubt (and also for the reasons stated above), the plaintiff would (<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">simultaneously</span>) have <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">necessarily</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proved</span> its (<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">overall</span>) case against the defendant <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on a balance of probabilities</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: whether the appellant had adequately pleaded that the SA was supported by consideration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Although this particular issue relates to the doctrine of consideration, it concerns, in fact, a preliminary procedural point in relation to <span class="font-italic">pleadings</span> (or, in the respondent’s view, an <span class="font-italic">absence</span> thereof). The position taken by the respondent was that the appellant’s case should have failed <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span> owing to her failure to plead that the SA was supported by consideration. As against this, the appellant contended that the respondent had not suffered any prejudice from any failure on her part to plead that the SA was supported by consideration. According to the appellant, her reply and defence to counterclaim contained a blanket denial of para 6 of the defence and counterclaim, which contained the respondent’s averments as to the lack of consideration for the SA, and the respondent had notice of the appellant’s arguments from the time of her opening statement. Yet, the respondent still failed to challenge the appellant’s reliance on unpleaded particulars at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We agreed with the decision of the Judge that the appellant should be permitted to raise her arguments on consideration notwithstanding the fact that they might have been unpleaded. The purpose of pleadings is to ensure that each party was aware of the respective arguments against it and that neither was therefore taken by surprise (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Aesthetic Medical Partners Pte Ltd and other appeals and another matter</span> [2020] 1 SLR 606 at [15]–[16]). We noted that there appeared to be some reference in the appellant’s pleadings to the fact that the SA had dispensed with the need for consideration. In the appellant’s reply and defence to counterclaim dated 29 August 2016, it was stated that “the [SA] was executed as a valid and binding amendment to the CLA pursuant to Clause 9.3 of the CLA”, which would cohere with the appellant’s argument that cl 9.3 of the CLA dispensed with the need for consideration for contractual variation. While the remaining arguments relied on by the appellant were not particularised in her pleadings (apart from the blanket denial mentioned above at [34]), we found that the respondent had not been caught by surprise by these arguments and crucially, we did not think that they caused any prejudice to the respondent. The respondent was unable to particularise any prejudice which it had suffered in its case, other than to claim there ought to be stricter adherence to the requirements of pleadings where a defendant has made a submission of no case to answer, and that it had been caught off-guard by the appellant’s reliance on an unpleaded point. Given the circumstances, we were of the view that this was a scenario where the appellant should be permitted to raise her arguments on consideration notwithstanding the fact that they might have been unpleaded as the respondent could be adequately compensated with costs (see the decisions of this court in <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18] and <span class="font-italic">Sun </span><span class="font-italic">Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo </span>[2011] 2 SLR 196 at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: whether cl 9.3 of the CLA dispensed with the need for fresh consideration for a variation of the CLA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 There is no reason, in principle, why contracting parties cannot, by <span class="font-italic">agreement</span>, dispense with the doctrine of consideration with regard to the <span class="font-italic">variation</span> of <span class="font-italic">that</span> particular contract. Any contractual term to that effect would not only be <span class="font-italic">part of the bargain between the parties</span> but would also be one that is part of a contract, which, in its <span class="font-italic">formation</span>, was in fact <span class="font-italic">supported by valid consideration </span>in the eyes of the law to begin with. <span class="font-italic">If</span>, indeed, that particular contract had been formed <span class="font-italic">without</span> such valid consideration, then <span class="font-italic">that </span>contract (and, of course, all the terms contained therein) would <span class="font-italic">not </span>have been able to pass legal muster in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The former point (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the court would be <span class="font-italic">giving effect </span>to <span class="font-italic">the bargain</span> between the parties) may appear to be <span class="font-italic">consistent with</span> the argument (considered below) that one should dispense with the requirement of consideration where a contract is <span class="font-italic">varied </span>because the parties are already in a cooperative venture where some give and take is required; as we shall see below, however, this assumption of a cooperative venture is <span class="font-italic">not necessarily </span><span class="font-italic">always </span>the case, <span class="font-italic">but</span> where the parties have in fact <span class="font-italic">agreed </span>to <span class="font-italic">dispense with</span> the doctrine of consideration in relation to the <span class="font-italic">variation</span> of their contract, it is <span class="font-italic">implicit</span> in such an agreement that they had <span class="font-italic">crystallised </span>that spirit of cooperation <span class="font-italic">and</span> (more importantly) given it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">concrete </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">legal</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> form</span> (at least in so far as the issue of <span class="font-italic">variation</span> is concerned). This is, of course, <span class="font-italic">quite different</span> from a more general argument (or, rather, <span class="font-italic">assumption</span>) that the parties are <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> (<span class="font-italic">and therefore always</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>in a situation of cooperation as well as give and take simply by entering into a contract with each other; as we shall elaborate upon below, this need not necessarily be the case, especially where parties subsequently <span class="font-italic">vary</span> their contract as such variation can occur for <span class="font-italic">a variety </span>of reasons (not all of which are premised on a cooperative venture or an atmosphere of give and take). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Returning to the present case, the key question in the context of the present appeal in general and in relation to cl 9.3 in particular would therefore be whether the appellant and the respondent had intended that that clause <span class="font-italic">dispense with</span> the need or requirement for <span class="font-italic">consideration</span> if the CLA was <span class="font-italic">varied – </span>as was indeed in fact the case. At this juncture, the issue becomes one of <span class="font-italic">contractual construction </span>(here, of cl 9.3 of the CLA) – and it is to this issue that our attention now turns.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Clause 9.3 of the CLA reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9.3  No amendment or variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless so amended or varied in writing and signed by each of the Parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In our judgment, on an objective reading of the plain language of cl 9.3, it cannot be the case that the parties had dispensed with the need or requirement for consideration if the CLA was varied. As the Judge rightly stated, cl 9.3 merely prescribes signed writing as a minimum threshold for legally valid variation to occur. In other words, it provides for a necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, condition for validity of a subsequent variation of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The appellant attempted to liken her case to that of <span class="font-italic">Benlen</span> ([18] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), where Chan Seng Onn J had held (albeit <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>) that the meaning of a particular clause of the relevant contract was that the parties had in fact agreed to dispense with the doctrine of consideration in relation to the variation of their contract. The clause in question read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14.2 This Sub-Contract shall be varied or modified only with prior written consent from both parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In our view, the difference between the clause in <span class="font-italic">Benlen</span> and cl 9.3 of the CLA is at once clear. Clause 9.3 of the CLA cannot be construed to mean that the parties agreed that no fresh consideration would be required for subsequent variation, because of the reasons set out at [40] above. The clause in <span class="font-italic">Benlen</span>, however, can, as it provided that the contract “shall [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, must] be varied or modified only with [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as long as there is] prior written consent from both parties”. We therefore rejected the appellant’s argument in this respect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The appellant further argued that even if cl 9.3 of the CLA did not exhaustively provide for the requirements of a valid variation of contract, the parties nonetheless intended for the CLA to be varied or amended without the need for consideration. According to the appellant, any interpretation of cl 9.3 otherwise would result in “potentially absurd consequences”, as it would amount to an interpretation that parties had only intended that certain variations to the CLA would be binding even though the “only stated requirements” of cl 9.3 were complied with by the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Despite claiming to be otherwise, this argument in reality hinged on the requirements in cl 9.3 being exhaustive – if complying with the “only stated requirements” of cl 9.3 did not result in a valid variation agreement being concluded, this would only be “absurd” if cl 9.3 provided for necessary and sufficient requirements in the first place. This was not the case, and we therefore dismissed this argument as well. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 4: whether the appellant had furnished consideration for the SA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  This particular issue relates to the question whether the appellant had, in any event, furnished fresh (and valid) consideration for the respondent’s promise which it now seeks to enforce. The appellant’s primary argument in this regard centred on the alleged “<span class="font-italic">goodwill</span>” which was said to constitute sufficient consideration within the meaning and scope set out in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). Specifically, the appellant alleged that the respondent gained her “goodwill” to provide future loans to the respondent or its related entities in return for her entry into the SA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Before proceeding to consider this particular issue, however, a couple of preliminary observations are apposite.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, the alleged consideration that has been sought to be furnished might be insufficient in the eyes of the law for at least three reasons. It might be the case that the alleged consideration, although contemporaneous with or otherwise causally connected with the promise that is sought to be enforced, is <span class="font-italic">itself</span> insufficient in the eyes of the law to begin with. It might also be the case that the alleged consideration, although otherwise sufficient in the eyes of the law, is not contemporaneous with or otherwise causally connected with the promise that is sought to be enforced – in which case it will be considered what has been termed <span class="font-italic">past </span>consideration that will also <span class="font-italic">not</span> pass legal muster. Finally, it might be the case that the alleged consideration is not only itself insufficient in the eyes of the law but is <span class="font-italic">also</span> past consideration in the manner just described. Much will, of course, depend on the precise facts and circumstances of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Secondly, having referred to the concept of “causal connection” in the preceding paragraph, it should be noted that there may be <span class="font-italic">different senses</span> in which that concept might be used. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">One</span> sense is, as we put it in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span> ([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span> at [82]), that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he element of request is necessary in order to establish a link between the parties concerned. So, for example, if the promisee chooses, of his or her own volition (and without more), to confer a benefit on the promisor, this will not constitute sufficient consideration in the eyes of the law. Likewise, if the promisee chooses, of his or her own volition, to incur a detriment, then (as the leading English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Combe v Combe</span> [1951] 2 KB 214 … clearly illustrates) that would <span class="font-italic">not</span> constitute sufficient consideration in the eyes of the law. [emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Another</span> sense in which the concept of “causal connection” might be used occurs in relation to the so-called exception to the well-established principle that “past consideration is no consideration”. As this court observed (again, in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span> at [83]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It should also be noted that an absence of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">linkage</span> between the parties can also occur if the consideration is <span class="font-italic">past</span> – hence, the oft-cited principle that “past consideration is no consideration”. However, the courts look to the substance rather than the form. Hence, what looks at first blush like past consideration will still pass legal muster if there is, in effect, a <span class="font-italic">single</span> (contemporaneous) transaction (the common understanding of the parties being that consideration would indeed be furnished at the time the promisor made his or her promise to the promisee). [emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case, the appellant argued that the Judge had erred in requiring a “common understanding” between the parties that the future loans would result from the respondent’s entry into the SA, because the phrase “common understanding” was taken from the judgment of <span class="font-italic">Rainforest Trading </span>([18] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38], where the term was used in the context of past acts which validly constitute consideration for a later promise. According to the appellant, all that should be required is that the “practical benefit” had moved from the promisee to the promisor, and there is no requirement that there be a “common understanding” or “specific promise” that the benefit would accrue to the respondent at the time the promise was made. In the alternative, the appellant argued that it “could be inferred” that there was an “expectation of goodwill” to be granted to the respondent at the time the SA was entered into, and this sufficed as valid consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 To be clear, we noted that it was not the appellant’s case that consideration, by way of practical benefit or otherwise, was provided by the performance of the appellant’s existing contractual obligations under the CLA, and rightly so. Before the SA was entered into, all of the appellant’s obligations under the CLA had been performed, and the entire loan under the CLA had been disbursed. There was no evidence that the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of the SA took place before the third and final disbursement of the loan. The appellant’s pleaded action against the respondent was also founded on the SA, and not on any oral agreement that preceded the signing of the SA. These facts stand in stark contrast to those of <span class="font-italic">Williams</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), which<span class="font-italic"> </span>is a case where one party’s promise to perform an obligation which it was already contractually obligated to perform, <span class="font-italic">but </span><span class="font-italic">where performance had not yet been completed</span> at the time of the contractual variation, was found to confer a practical benefit on the other party who promised an additional benefit under the variation agreement. Such was not the case here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 We also noted that it was not the appellant’s case that she had made a <span class="font-italic">promise </span>to enter into the SIA and the June to October 2015 loan agreements as consideration for the SA. This is for two reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Although the negotiations relating to the SIA occurred at about the same time as the negotiations for the SA, and the SIA was entered into on the same day as the SA (and the appellant’s case refers to these facts), the negotiations surrounding the SIA between Mr Han and Mr Sim were described by Mr Han as “entirely separate from the CLA and the re-negotiation of its terms leading up to the [SA]”. On appeal, the appellant admitted that the SIA and the CLA were “entirely separate contracts”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellant’s counsel confirmed, during oral submissions before us as well as in closing submissions before the court below, that the appellant was not making the argument that she had made a specific promise to extend the loans under the SIA to Biomax Technologies in exchange for the respondent assuming further obligations under the SA. Indeed, there was no evidence to such effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Instead, the appellant’s case was that “goodwill” had moved from herself to the respondent, and this alone constituted a sufficient nexus. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In our judgment, the appellant’s criticism of the Judge’s ruling failed to appreciate the different senses in which the concept of “causal connection” might be used. While the concept of a causal connection might have been used in <span class="font-italic">Rainforest Trading </span>in the second sense as described at [48] above, in the present case, it is the <span class="font-italic">first</span> sense which is relevant. On the facts of the present case, assuming that the alleged consideration is itself sufficient in the eyes of the law, the element of request necessary in order to establish a link between the parties was <span class="font-italic">absent</span>, as there was no request for any “goodwill” by the respondent leading to the conclusion of the SA. It is insufficient that the benefit the respondent conferred upon the appellant pursuant to the SA stirred up “goodwill” on the appellant’s part and of her own volition. In addition, we note that motive for making a promise does not in itself amount to consideration (see <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Chitty</span>”) at para 4-011 and the oft-cited English decision of <span class="font-italic">Thomas v Thomas</span> (1842) 2 QB 851<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Thomas</span>”) at 859). The assertion that the respondent might have been motivated, in making its promise under the SA, by the prospect of obtaining “goodwill” from the appellant was therefore also insufficient to establish the appellant’s case in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In any event, the alleged consideration is insufficient in the eyes of the law to begin with. To the extent that “goodwill” referred to the improved relationship between the appellant and Sim and/or the respondent, we note the decision in <span class="font-italic">Thomas</span> (at 859) that there is no consideration for a promise made “in consideration of natural love and affection”, as such purported consideration bore no value in the eyes of the law. To the extent that “goodwill” referred to some increased likelihood that the appellant would extend future loans to the respondent or its related entities, we note the following extract from <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> at para 4-025:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Discretionary promise </span>Consideration would again be illusory where it was alleged to consist of a promise the terms of which left performance entirely to the discretion of the promisor. A person does not provide consideration by promising to do something “if I feel like it”, or “unless I change my mind”. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We agree. The present case might even be said to be one step removed from a discretionary promise, as there was never any promise regarding any future loans to begin with. In sum, the SA was not supported by valid consideration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 5: whether the requirement for consideration should be dispensed with for contractual variations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This particular issue relates to the new (and <span class="font-italic">potentially far reaching</span>) argument proffered by the appellant on appeal that the doctrine of consideration should, in any event, be <span class="font-italic">dispensed with</span> in cases concerning contractual <span class="font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-italic"> or modification</span>. However, as a preliminary point, we address the respondent’s objection to the effect that the appellant should not have been granted leave to make this new argument on appeal in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">Grace Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Te Deum Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 1 SLR 76, this court held that applications by a party to raise new points on appeal (and in particular, points representing a substantial departure from the position taken by that party below) would be subject to careful consideration, with due regard being had to factors including the following (at [38]): (a) the nature of the parties’ arguments below; (b) whether the court had considered and provided any findings and reasoning in relation to the new point; (c) whether further submissions, evidence, or findings would have been necessitated had the new points been raised below; and (d) any prejudice that might result to the counterparty in the appeal if leave were granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The respondent contended that allowing the appellant to pursue this point on appeal would cause it to suffer prejudice. According to the respondent, it had chosen to abandon all its defences save the defence of no consideration because parties had accepted that the doctrine of consideration applied to contractual variations. However, the respondent failed to show that the parties’ agreement as to the applicable legal principles preceded its decision to rely only on the defence of no consideration. Indeed, it had decided to abandon all defences save the defence that the SA was unsupported by consideration on 19 January 2019, <span class="font-italic">prior to the filing of opening statements for trial</span> on 21 January 2019. It therefore appeared to us that the respondent had made the decision to abandon its other defences before the point at which it could have gained notice of any legal arguments that the appellant intended to rely on. More importantly, this argument was purely a legal one which did not require any new evidence to be adduced, which meant that this court would have been in just as advantageous a position as the court below to adjudicate upon the issue (see the decisions of this court in <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock v Khoo Eng Lim</span> [2010] 3 SLR 179 at [63] and <span class="font-italic">JWR</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Edmond Pereira Law Corp and another </span>[2020] SGCA 68 at [29]). Accordingly, we were of the view that leave should be granted to the appellant to make the argument as to whether the doctrine of consideration should be dispensed with in cases concerning contractual variation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Having dealt with the respondent’s preliminary objection, let us turn now to consider the appellant’s substantive argument that the doctrine of consideration should be dispensed with or abolished in so far as the <span class="font-italic">variation</span> of contracts is concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), this court undertook (at [111]−[116]) a review of the possible alternatives were the doctrine of consideration to be abolished, and concluded as follows (at [117]−[118]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">117  Because so much academic ink has been spilt on the doctrine of consideration over so very many decades (with no concrete action being taken) and because there is (as we have noted at [92] above) such a dearth of cases on the doctrine itself, it would appear that any proposed reform of the doctrine is much ado about nothing. Indeed, the doctrine of consideration is (notwithstanding the numerous critiques of it) nevertheless still (as also noted) an established part of not only the Singapore landscape in particular but also the common law landscape in general. Not surprisingly, it is a standard topic in all the contract textbooks. In short, it cannot be ignored. However, because the doctrine of consideration <span class="font-italic">does </span>contain certain basic weaknesses which have been pointed out, <span class="font-italic">in extenso</span>, in the relevant legal literature, it almost certainly needs to be reformed. The basic difficulties and alternatives have been set out briefly above but will need to be considered in much greater detail when the issue next comes squarely before this court. One major difficulty lies in the fact that a legal mechanism must be maintained that will enable the courts to effectively and practically ascertain which promises ought to be enforceable. Hence, even if the doctrine of consideration is abolished, an alternative (or alternatives) must take its place. There then arises the question as to whether or not the alternatives themselves are sufficiently well established in order that they might furnish the requisite legal guidance to the courts. In this regard, it is significant to note that the various alternatives briefly mentioned above <span class="font-italic">are</span><span class="font-italic"> (apart from the requirement of writing) already a part of Singapore law</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">118  In the circumstances, maintenance of the status quo (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the availability of both (a somewhat dilute) doctrine of consideration <span class="font-italic">as well as</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the alternative doctrines canvassed above) may well be the <span class="font-italic">most practical</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>solution inasmuch as it will afford the courts <span class="font-italic">a range of legal options </span>to achieve a just and fair result in the case concerned. However, problems of <span class="font-italic">theoretical </span>coherence may remain and are certainly intellectually challenging (as the many perceptive pieces and even books and monographs clearly demonstrate). Nevertheless, given the long pedigree of the doctrine, the fact that no single doctrine is wholly devoid of difficulties, and (more importantly) the need for a legal mechanism to ascertain which promises the courts will enforce, the ‘theoretical untidiness’ may well be acceptable in the light of the existing practical advantages (though <span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[J W Carter, Andrew Phang &amp; Jill Poole, “Reactions to Williams v Roffey” (1995) 8 JCL 248<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 265]). However, this is obviously a provisional view only as the issue of reform was not before the court in the present appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As alluded to at the outset of the present judgment, after <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span> academic ink <span class="font-italic">continued</span> to be spilt on the doctrine of consideration (see, for example (and by one of the staunchest supporters of the doctrine itself), Mindy Chen-Wishart, “Consideration and Serious Intention” [2009] Sing JLS 434 and, by the same author, “In Defence of Consideration” (2013) 13 OUCLJ 209 as well as “Reforming Consideration: No Greener Pastures” in <span class="font-italic">Contract in Commercial Law</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at Ch 5 (and the legal literature cited therein); a useful and updated overview of the various issues may also be found in Jonathan Morgan, <span class="font-italic">Great Debates in Contract Law</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Red Globe Press, 3rd Ed, 2020) at Ch 2). With respect (and despite the interesting academic analyses), we are no nearer a solution that is at once both theoretically <span class="font-italic">as well as </span>practically viable and therefore see no reason to change the views we had expressed in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>. However, could it be argued that that decision was concerned with the operation of the doctrine of consideration in the context of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">formation</span> of contracts whereas the present case relates to the operation of the doctrine in the context of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> or modification</span> of contracts (though <span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the view of the Judge in the court below at [99] as well as in the decision of the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">S </span><span class="font-italic">Pacific Resources Ltd v Tomolugen Holdings Ltd </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1049, especially at [14]). As also alluded to at the outset of this judgment, it is argued in some case law as well as some academic commentary that, in so far as the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> or modification</span> of contracts is concerned, the requirement of consideration may be <span class="font-italic">dispensed with</span>. And it is to those materials that our attention now turns – bearing in mind that the <span class="font-italic">substance</span> of the arguments concerned is what matters as well as the fact that accepting them would simultaneously entail a departure from decisions such as <span class="font-italic">Williams</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Foakes</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 With respect, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">none</span> of the arguments in favour of the abolition of the doctrine of consideration in the context of the <span class="font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-italic"> or modification</span> of contracts is persuasive. Let us elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">First</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span>, we explained why it was most practically wise to maintain the status quo (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the availability of both the (somewhat dilute) doctrine of consideration <span class="font-italic">as well as</span> the alternative doctrines such as economic duress, undue influence, unconscionability as well as promissory estoppel and proprietary estoppel) inasmuch as such an approach would afford the courts <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a range of legal options</span> to achieve a just and fair result in the case concerned (see also Lee Pey Woan, “Consideration” in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Consideration</span>”) Ch 4 at para 04.109). Although <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>related to a situation regarding the <span class="font-italic">formation </span>of a contract, this is a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">general</span> argument that would apply <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">equally</span> to situations relating to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> or modification</span> of contracts (which is the situation in the present case).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Secondly</span> (and on a related note), the difficulties with regard to the possible alternatives to the doctrine of consideration (which were referred to briefly in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)) do not appear to have been resolved despite the period of more than a decade since that particular decision was handed down. Indeed, in some instances, the difficulties appear to have either worsened or opportunities to resolve them have not been availed of by the court concerned. An example of the latter occurred in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in <span class="font-italic">MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd </span>[2019] AC 119, where the court managed (by holding that the variation agreement in question was invalid) to avoid having to deal directly with the issue of consideration in respect of that agreement – in particular, the status of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Foakes</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in light of the development in <span class="font-italic">Williams </span>(which, at the English Court of Appeal level, was at odds with <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Selectmove Ltd </span>[1995] 1 WLR 474 (this particular issue was in fact referred to in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>at [102]–[103])). As one commentator interestingly observed, “[s]ince [<span class="font-italic">Foakes</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>is a House of Lords decision, [its] re-examination can be performed only by the Supreme Court; but, with its having taken 134 years for this issue to finally reach our highest court, it is unclear when it will have another opportunity to do so” (see Robert Harris, “Modifications, Wrangles, and Bypassing” [2018] LMCLQ 441 at p 449). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Thirdly</span>, and turning specifically to the issue of the <span class="font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-italic"> or modification </span>of a contract, it has been argued that the requirement of consideration may be unnecessary because, unlike the situation where parties enter into a contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a situation relating to the <span class="font-italic">formation</span> of a contract), the parties in the situation where a <span class="font-italic">variation</span><span class="font-italic"> or modification</span> occurs are <span class="font-italic">already </span>in a contractual relationship with each other (see, for example, Tan Cheng Han, “Contract Modifications, Consideration and Moral Hazard” (2005) 17 SAcLJ 566, especially at pp 578–580 and John Cartwright, <span class="font-italic">Formation and Variation of Contracts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Cartwright</span>”) at para 9–24). Looked at in this light, the argument is that the parties who are already in a contractual relationship with each other are more likely to be flexible with each other in order to advance their common enterprise and that to therefore insist that any contractual variations or modifications require consideration may run counter to or militate against such an enterprise (and/or situations where one party might be willing to afford the other party a concession to cultivate a long-term relationship). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Whilst this is one possible perspective, it is <span class="font-italic">not</span> the <span class="font-italic">only</span> one. Parties enter into contracts for a myriad of reasons and may desire to vary or modify their contract for a myriad of reasons (not all of which might be as positive or sanguine as depicted in the scenario just considered). It is important to note at this juncture that a <span class="font-italic">legal </span>rule or principle is, <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span>, <span class="font-italic">normative </span>in nature and is intended to be applicable <span class="font-italic">universally</span>, <span class="font-italic">regardless of</span> the precise factual scenario concerned. Hence, it ought to cover as many potential factual situations as possible. Given the myriad of factual permutations (including those that occur <span class="font-italic">after </span>the contract has been entered into), a change in the law (here, the dispensing with the requirement of consideration where the variation of contracts is concerned) would be consistent with only one basic scenario (where the parties in an existing contractual relationship are seeking to cooperate with each other). What, then, about the argument that there exist <span class="font-italic">alternative legal doctrines </span>which would nevertheless accommodate and deal with other scenarios where the parties are not so sanguine, thus addressing any injustice or unfairness that might result from the variation of the contract concerned? <span class="font-italic">However</span>, that merely brings us back <span class="font-italic">full circle</span> to a point that was already considered in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span> – that the alternative doctrines themselves contain specific difficulties that need to be ironed out <span class="font-italic">and</span> that including the doctrine of consideration as part of <span class="font-italic">a range of legal options</span> (<span class="font-italic">in addition to </span>these alternative legal doctrines) may well be the best (as well as most practical) way forward. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It should also be noted that, pursuant to <span class="font-italic">Williams</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(which is now part of the law relating to the doctrine of consideration in Singapore), it is no longer onerous to demonstrate that the requirement of consideration has been satisfied because any <span class="font-italic">factual</span> benefit or detriment would suffice in the eyes of the law. Looked at in this light, perhaps the suggested inconvenience to the parties might be somewhat exaggerated in a situation where all is well between them. Further, as just noted, the situation between parties may <span class="font-italic">not</span> always be so sanguine – in which case the requirement of consideration <span class="font-italic">does</span> indeed serve an important function.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 We have also seen that if the parties are truly optimistic, they could <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">exclude</span> the requirement for consideration for the <span class="font-italic">variation</span> of the contract by <span class="font-italic">unambiguously</span> stating so at the point the contract is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">formed</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>(see [36] above). And, of course, there would be no difficulty if the parties vary the term(s) of their contract by way of a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">deed</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Fourthly</span>, the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">case law</span> is – at best – <span class="font-italic">inconclusive</span>. We turn, first, to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">New </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Zealand</span> position. The leading decision in this regard is that of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in <span class="font-italic">Antons</span><span class="font-italic"> Trawling Co Ltd v Smith </span>[2003] 2 NZLR 23 (“<span class="font-italic">Antons</span><span class="font-italic"> Trawling</span>”). However, a close reading of the judgment of the court in that case (which was delivered by Baragwanath J) will reveal that the court did, in fact, find (after a meticulous examination of the relevant facts) that the promisee had furnished <span class="font-italic">sufficient</span> consideration pursuant to the legal principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span>. As the court observed (at [93]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We are satisfied that [<span class="font-italic">Stilk</span> <span class="font-italic">v Myrick</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1809) 2 Camp 317] <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">can no longer to be taken to control</span> such cases as [<span class="font-italic">Williams</span>]<span class="font-italic">, </span>[<span class="font-italic">Attorney-General for England and Wales</span><span class="font-italic"> v R </span>[2002] 2 NZLR 91] and the present case where there is no element of duress or other policy factor suggesting that an agreement, duly performed, should not attract the legal consequences that each party must reasonably be taken to have expected. On the contrary, a result that deprived Mr Smith [the promisee] of the benefit of what Antons [the promisor] had promised he should receive would be inconsistent with the essential principle underlying the law of contract, that the law will seek to give effect to freely accepted reciprocal undertakings.

Indeed, as one commentator aptly observed, “[t]he status of <span class="font-italic">Williams</span> and the practical benefit test in New Zealand is now ambiguous” (see Karen N Scott, “From Sailors to Fisherman: Contractual Variation and the Abolition of the Pre-Existing Duty Rule in New Zealand” (2005) 11 Canterbury L Rev 201 (“<span class="font-italic">Scott</span>”) at p 214 (see also at p 215); reference may also be made to Brian Coote, “Variations Sans Consideration” (2011) 27 JCL 185 (“<span class="font-italic">Coote</span>”) at p 197 as well as Jeremy Finn, Stephen Todd &amp; Matthew Barber, <span class="font-italic">Burrows, Finn and Todd on the Law of Contract in New Zealand </span>(LexisNexis NZ Limited, 6th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Burrows, Finn and Todd</span>”) at p 129). Indeed, Prof Scott also refers to a point that has already been raised above (at [64]) – which is that the <span class="font-italic">alternative</span> doctrine of economic duress may itself embody problems of its own (see <span class="font-italic">Scott </span>at pp 211−212; see also Craig Ulyatt, “The Demise of Consideration for Contract Variations” (2003) 9 Auckland U L Rev 1386 (“<span class="font-italic">Ulyatt</span>”) at p 1397) as might the other doctrines (such as undue influence and the doctrine of unconscionability (see <span class="font-italic">Scott</span> at pp 212−214)). It is also apposite to note that it has also been argued that the rationale for awarding damages for expectation loss can only be justified by requiring consideration to be demonstrated (see <span class="font-italic">Ulyatt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 1393).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It is also interesting to note that Baragwanath J, in arriving at the more radical proposition that consideration was not required in the context of contractual variation or modification in <span class="font-italic">Antons</span><span class="font-italic"> Trawling</span>, appeared to be heavily influenced by Prof Brian Coote’s critique of <span class="font-italic">Williams</span> ([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) in “Consideration and Benefit in Fact and in Law” (1990) 3 JCL 23. In essence, in rejecting the approach centring on practical benefit or detriment as being an unprincipled way of achieving justice, Prof Coote concluded his critique by stating (at p 28, and presumably as a principled alternative) that “[t]heoretically, it may still be open to a court of final resort in a common law country to decide that consideration should not be necessary for the variation of a contract” (indeed, in a subsequent article already referred to above, Prof Coote opined that the court in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span> dispensed, “at least for all practical purposes”, with the requirement of consideration “by the use of <span class="font-italic">a fiction</span>” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Coote</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 197)). If, however, <span class="font-italic">Williams </span>is considered a principled approach, then there is no need to adopt the more radical alternative suggested by Prof Coote. At this juncture, it is perhaps apposite to pause to observe, parenthetically, that part of Prof Coote’s dissatisfaction with the approach in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span> might be attributed to the fact that – in contrast to the traditional approach in <span class="font-italic">Stilk</span> <span class="font-italic">v Myrick</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1809) 2 Camp 317 (“<span class="font-italic">Stilk</span>”) – recourse to a concept of <span class="font-italic">factual</span> benefit or detriment may be argued to lack <span class="font-italic">normative </span>force. Whilst this last-mentioned argument might be attractive at first blush, it neglects, with respect, the proposition that <span class="font-italic">the court</span> can indeed <span class="font-italic">confer normative force</span> on <span class="font-italic">a test</span>, the <span class="font-italic">content</span> of which might turn on a <span class="font-italic">factual</span> determination. Viewed in this light, the approach in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span> is no less a <span class="font-italic">legal </span>test (although, as just mentioned, its <span class="font-italic">content</span> might turn on a <span class="font-italic">factual</span> determination). Indeed, in the ordinary course of legal discourse as well as analysis, the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> principles are not enunciated for their own sake – they are intended to be <span class="font-italic">applied</span> to the relevant <span class="font-italic">facts </span>of a particular case. The approach in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span> embodies this although, by its very nature, the legal principles and the relevant facts are perhaps more inextricably connected and may – to that extent – be viewed as two (albeit different) sides of the same coin. This does not, of course, detract from the obvious point (which we also acknowledged in <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [118]) that the approach in <span class="font-italic">Williams </span>results in “a somewhat dilute” doctrine of consideration – although, depending on the precise facts and circumstances of a particular case, the value of the practical benefit or detriment concerned may indeed be significant (see Pey-Woan Lee, “Contract Modifications – Reflections on Two Commonwealth Cases” (2012) 12 OUCLJ 189 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee</span>”) at p 196). As has also been pointed out on a related note, “a more straightforward explanation of [<span class="font-italic">Williams</span>] [may] lie in the recognition that a re-promise does confer additional value on the counter-party if the re-promise represents <span class="font-italic">an increased chance of performance</span>” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Lee</span> at p 197).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 One might also usefully note the following observations by Baragwanath J in an extrajudicial paper delivered after he had retired from the bench (see David Baragwanath, “Judging: A Butterfly View” (2010) 16 Canterbury L Rev 243 at p 251):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Judge’s responsibility for judicious updating and development of the judge-made common law is no longer disputed by those familiar with the process.

Notably, there was no real discussion of the detailed reasons for endorsing such an approach, although this is perhaps understandable as <span class="font-italic">Antons</span><span class="font-italic"> Trawling</span> was a decision of the Court of Appeal. It should also be noted that sufficient consideration in law was found on the facts of the case (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> the phrase “in any event” in the observation just quoted) (reference may also be made to <span class="font-italic">Hunan Holdings Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Virionyx Corporation Ltd </span>(2005) 2 NZCCLR 1079 at [45]–[51]).

These are just a sampling of various decisions of the High Court of New Zealand that demonstrate that there has been no decisive or conclusive pronouncement that dispenses with the requirement of consideration in the context of contractual variation or modification and that, generally speaking, consideration continues to be a requirement in this particular regard.

The court in that case held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that no enforceable contract<span class="font-italic"> </span>had been entered into between the parties and that the respondent was therefore not liable to pay the appellant for the new equipment which the latter alleged that the former had promised to do.

These holdings ought to be borne in mind as we examine the detailed reasoning of the court (the judgment of the court was delivered by J T Robertson JA, and concurred with by W S Turnbull and M E L Larlee JJA). The judgment by Robertson JA is a comprehensive and scholarly one. His assessment of <span class="font-italic">Williams </span>in the context of the enforceability of post-contractual modifications or variations is not a positive one (at [28]). He is also critical of artificial attempts to locate consideration (at [29], where he states, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that he agrees with “Professor Waddams’ exhortation that courts should avoid ‘fictional’ attempts to find consideration”). Robertson JA also points to the fact that the doctrine of consideration was formulated “before the recognition of the modern and evolving doctrine of economic duress” (at [30]). He then concludes thus (at [31]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For the above reasons, I am prepared to accept that a post-contractual modification, unsupported by consideration, may be enforceable so long as it is established that the variation was not procured under economic duress.

On the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">other hand</span>, for example, a person who agrees to pay more than the original contract price either in writing under seal or in return for a ‘peppercorn’ is entitled to argue that the agreement was procured under economic duress. [emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 A plain reading of the quotation in the preceding paragraph suggests that there might be an inconsistency (see also, in this regard, a similar view in Rick Bigwood, “Doctrinal Reform and Post-Contractual Modifications in New Brunswick: <span class="font-italic">NAV Canada v. Greater Fredericton Airport Authority Inc.</span>” (2010) 49 Can Bus LJ 256 (“<span class="font-italic">Bigwood</span>”) at p 266). In particular, it suggests that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">doctrine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of <span class="font-italic">consideration</span> is still <span class="font-italic">alive and well</span>, so to speak – and, in fact, may even retain its original legal form as set out in the seminal English decision of <span class="font-italic">Stilk</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([69] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) (and, possibly at least, as modified later in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span>). <span class="font-italic">However</span>, a closer reading of the same quotation suggests that whether or not sufficient consideration has been furnished might merely be a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">factor</span> in the decision of the court as to whether or not there was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">economic duress</span>. At this particular juncture, however, one may ask whether, in a situation where there is indeed <span class="font-italic">sufficient </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">consideration</span> in the eyes of the law, that would – <span class="font-italic">in and of itself</span> – suffice to render the contract concerned enforceable. It is, of course, true that the doctrine of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">economic duress</span> could <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">nevertheless</span> be invoked by the promisor to argue that the contract is <span class="font-italic">otherwise unenforceable</span>. At this particular juncture, however, it should be noted that both consideration and economic duress are being invoked as <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">separate and independent doctrines</span>. In fairness, it should be noted that it is entirely possible to rely upon the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">doctrine</span> of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">economic duress</span> whilst having regard to <span class="font-italic">consideration </span>as a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">factor</span> and this may well be what Robertson JA had in mind. <span class="font-italic">However</span>, there is no reason in principle why <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">both</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">doctrines</span> (of <span class="font-italic">consideration </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">economic duress</span>) cannot potentially operate together as they are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, it could be argued that there could – in many situations at least – be a fine line between consideration as a <span class="font-italic">doctrine</span> on the one hand and consideration as a <span class="font-italic">factor</span> in determining whether there is economic duress on the other. This appears, in fact, to be implicit in the quotation in the preceding paragraph. There is also the further difficulty that <span class="font-italic">consideration</span> was apparently also endorsed in its <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">doctrinal</span> <span class="font-italic">form</span> (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> the reference to <span class="font-italic">Stilk</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It is also noteworthy that, on the <span class="font-italic">actual facts</span> of <span class="font-italic">NAV </span>itself, the court found that there had been <span class="font-italic">no fresh consideration</span> furnished in law. It then proceeded to find that there had nevertheless been economic duress on the (same) facts (not least because the promisor made the promise concerned “under protest” and that this was what had happened in substance in any event) (at [64]–[66]). In doing so, the court applied the following approach which it had outlined earlier in its judgment (at [53]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to the above observations, a finding of economic duress is dependent <span class="font-underline">initially</span> on two conditions precedent. First, the promise (the contractual variation) must be extracted as a result of the exercise of ‘pressure’, whether characterized as a ‘demand’ or a ‘threat’. Second, the exercise of that pressure must have been such that the coerced party had no practical alternative but to agree to the coercer’s demand to vary the terms of the underlying contract. However, even if those two conditions precedent are satisfied, a finding of economic duress does not automatically follow. Once these two threshold requirements are met, the legal analysis must focus on the ultimate question: whether the coerced party ‘consented’ to the variation. <span class="font-italic">To make that determination three factors should be examined: (1)</span><span class="font-italic"> whether the promise was supported by consideration</span>; (2) whether the coerced party made the promise ‘under protest’ or ‘without prejudice’; and (3) if not, whether the coerced party took reasonable steps to disaffirm the promise as soon as practicable. Admittedly, the last two factors are more likely to have a bearing on the ultimate outcome of a case than the first. As well, note that under this general framework, no reference is made to the supposed victim having ‘independent legal advice’ or to the ‘good faith conduct’ on the part of the supposed coercer. I shall also deal with these matters separately. For the moment, I am going to focus on the framework outlined above.

These difficulties are significant ones which <span class="font-italic">NAV </span>does not, with respect, really address.

That this exercise was itself not uncontroversial is demonstrated by the fact that the court in <span class="font-italic">NAV </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">rejected</span> (at [47]–[50]) the criterion of <span class="font-italic">illegitimate pressure</span> and focused (at [51] and [53]) on the factor of whether there was a practical alternative instead. Given the fact that the criterion of illegitimate pressure has been traditionally accepted as a factor in both the case law as well as the textbooks demonstrates that the doctrine of economic duress is itself by no means free from difficulties (as already alluded to above). Indeed, a learned commentator delivered a powerful critique of the analytical framework<span class="font-italic"> </span>for economic duress proposed in <span class="font-italic">NAV </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Bigwood</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at pp 269–277; reference may also be made to <span class="font-italic">Lee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at pp 201–205). The court in <span class="font-italic">NAV </span>also explored (at [62]) the role of good faith on the part of the alleged coercer – an issue which, respectfully in our view, is one which has potential difficulties (particularly given the nature of good faith even as a doctrine, at least in the Singapore context (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> the decisions of this court in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and others </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 518, especially at [47] and [51]–[60] and <span class="font-italic">The One Suites Pte Ltd v Pacific Motor Credit (Pte) Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 3 SLR 695 at [44])). Finally (and on a more general level), the approach adopted by the court (see [77] above) was also somewhat different from that adopted in other jurisdictions (this is, of course, consistent with its rejection of the criterion of illegitimate pressure which has just been referred to).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">summary</span>, there are difficulties with the proposition advanced in <span class="font-italic">NAV</span> that the courts can dispense with the requirement of consideration in the context of contractual variation provided that there is no economic duress. We have <span class="font-italic">also</span> seen that not a smidgen of ambiguity was introduced, as the court in <span class="font-italic">NAV</span> did not (unambiguously at least) reject the doctrine of consideration in relation to <span class="font-italic">Stilk</span> ([69] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) <span class="font-italic">as well as </span>in relation to <span class="font-italic">Williams</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). If such ambiguity is resolved by construing consideration as a <span class="font-italic">factor</span> (as opposed to a doctrine) in the context of the court’s determination as to whether there is economic duress, this still does not explain the abovementioned endorsement of consideration in its <span class="font-italic">doctrinal </span>form.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 A subsequent decision was also cited by the appellant – that of the British Columbia Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">River Wind Ventures Ltd v British Columbia </span>[2009] BCJ No 880; [2009] BCSC 589 (reversed, <span class="font-italic">River Wind Ventures Ltd v British Columbia </span>[2011] BCJ No 257; [2011] BCCA 79 (albeit without any apparent doubt being cast on the analysis of the law relating to consideration as such; remitted for assessment of damages in <span class="font-italic">River Wind Ventures Ltd v British Columbia </span>[2011] BCJ No 1678; [2011] BCSC 1195); see also <span class="font-italic">British Columbia v River Wind Ventures Ltd </span>[2011] SCCA No 179 (application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed)). Whilst I C Meiklem J agreed (at [32]) with the reasoning of the court in <span class="font-italic">NAV</span>, the learned judge did note that the first sentence in [31] of <span class="font-italic">NAV</span> (as quoted at [74] above) might not have “fully capture[d] the modernized principle intended to be enunciated by the court”. It should also be noted that this particular decision did in fact also find that the plaintiff promisee had failed to establish that there had been fresh consideration furnished for the promise (at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Another decision in the Canadian context is that of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Harrity</span><span class="font-italic"> v Kennedy </span>[2009] NBJ No 305; [2009] NBCA 60 (“<span class="font-italic">Harrity</span>”). As in <span class="font-italic">NAV</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([74] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Robertson JA once again delivered the judgment of the court (which was concurred with by J C M Richard and B R Bell JJA). Not surprisingly, perhaps, the learned judge cited <span class="font-italic">NAV</span> (at [27]). More interestingly, in the very next paragraph, Robertson JA observed as follows (at [28]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I recognize that the doctrine of consideration provides a technical reason for refusing to enforce a contractual provision. Indeed, according to the ‘hunt and peck’ theory of consideration, judges will rummage through trial and appeal records to find the necessary consideration if that is what is needed to achieve a just result. If they believe that enforcement would lead to an unjust result, the same judges will declare there is an absence of meaningful consideration and, therefore, the promise is gratuitous and unenforceable. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">But even if I were entitled to jettison the doctrine of consideration, which I am at liberty to do</span>, I am at a loss to think of a good reason why the disclaimer clause should be deemed effective to insulate Mr. Harrity from liability. [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Whilst the learned judge’s observations as quoted in the preceding paragraph are reminiscent of his views in <span class="font-italic">NAV </span>(at [29], see [74] above), what is interesting in the context of the present judgment is his apparent acceptance that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">doctrine</span> of <span class="font-italic">consideration</span> still <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">exists</span>. Indeed, in relation to <span class="font-italic">Harrity</span>, Robertson JA expressly stated (at [31]) that he preferred to rest his decision with regard to the enforceability of the disclaimer clause “on a <span class="font-italic">lack of consideration</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 More recently, however, the British Columbia Court of Appeal, in <span class="font-italic">Rosas v </span><span class="font-italic">Toca </span>[2018] BCJ No 938; [2018] BCCA 191 (“<span class="font-italic">Rosas</span>”), had occasion to consider the issue as to whether it was appropriate to reform the doctrine of consideration as it applied to the variation of an existing contract (this case was also cited in <span class="font-italic">Cartwright</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 9–24, note 198). It was necessary in <span class="font-italic">Rosas </span>to determine whether there had been consideration furnished for the multiple forbearance agreements made annually that had been relied upon by the plaintiff in order to preserve her limitation period. The court below had held that the relevant limitation period had expired and the plaintiff appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which held that the forbearance agreements were enforceable and therefore delayed the running of the limitation period. In the circumstances, the plaintiff’s action was thus commenced within the limitation period and was not time-barred. Her appeal was therefore allowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 R J Bauman CJBC delivered the judgment of the court (with which L Fenlon and B Fisher JJA agreed). The learned judge undertook an extremely comprehensive survey of the relevant case law as well as legal scholarship in relation to the doctrine of consideration. Interestingly, Bauman CJBC was of the view (at [104]) that <span class="font-italic">NAV </span>“expressly approve[d] of, and indeed buil[t] on, the reasoning from [<span class="font-italic">Williams</span>]”. The learned judge then proceeded, later in his judgment, to elaborate that <span class="font-italic">NAV </span>had in fact “expanded the doctrine of consideration even more radically than in [<span class="font-italic">Williams</span>]”, and he observed as follows (at [109]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Robertson J.A. held that any ‘post-contractual modification’ may be enforceable though unsupported by consideration so long as economic duress was not made out. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">While</span> the Court cited <span class="font-italic">Williams v. Roffey Bros.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and appeared to adopt its reasoning</span>, there is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no mention of the need for practical benefit and no discussion of what practical benefit the Airport Authority received from Nav Canada’s performance of its pre</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">-existing obligation</span>. … [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The observations just quoted in the preceding paragraph hark back to the ambiguity we have already indicated above (at [75]–[76]). It is perhaps even more interesting that Bauman CJBC proceeds to immediately observe in the next paragraph (at [110]) as follows (a point which we have also already noted above at [83]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Interestingly, only a year after</span> deciding <span class="font-italic">NAV Canada</span>, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in [<span class="font-italic">Harrity</span>]<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, with Robertson J.A. again writing the reasons for the </span>Court, distinguished <span class="font-italic">NAV Canada</span> and held that a disclaimer of liability for misrepresentations in the sale of a yacht was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">unenforceable</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">for </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">lack of consideration</span>. … [emphasis added in bold italics and bold underlined italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Most interestingly, perhaps, Bauman CJBC observes (at [112]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With respect, it is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">difficult to reconcile</span> the result in [<span class="font-italic">Harrity</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>with the clear statement from <span class="font-italic">NAV</span><span class="font-italic"> Canada</span> that ‘[a]s a matter of c<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ommercial efficacy, it becomes necessary at times to adjust the parties’ respective contractual obligations and the law must then protect their legitimate expectations that the modifications or variations will be adhered to and regarded as enforceable</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">’ … [emphasis added]</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Whilst the learned judge does attempt an explanation, this is, with respect, only at the level of the specific facts and does not really deal with the </span>implications from the standpoint of <span class="font-italic">general legal principle</span> (which, <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span>, would be applicable to all future cases where the same legal issue arises).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It should also be noted that <span class="font-italic">Rosas </span>([84] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) also referred to reforms <span class="font-italic">beyond the shores</span> of Canada (at [123]–[130]), and these included the New Zealand decisions in <span class="font-italic">Antons</span><span class="font-italic"> Trawling</span> ([67] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Teat</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([71] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). It bears reiterating, however, that the New Zealand position is far from clear (see generally [67]–[73] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Bauman CJBC in <span class="font-italic">Rosas </span>also refers to the academic literature (at [131]–[154]) but, even here, it is clear that there is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no consensus</span>; this is perhaps not surprising in so far as the very nature of academic discourse is concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Having conducted such a comprehensive comparative survey, Bauman CJBC arrived at the conclusion (especially at [176], [180] and [183]) that the requirement of consideration can be dispensed with in the context of contractual variation or modification, taking into account the fact that it is unnecessary to justify the enforcement of such agreements by finding consideration through “imaginative bases” or “machinations” in any given fact situation (at [176] and [179]); he observes as follows (at [180]–[181]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">180 Enforcement of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">modification</span> in cases like this reflects the notion in a going transaction situation that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the parties are already in a contractual relationship and are simply adapting it to changed circumstances</span>. This is not the case of the ‘unwary signor or the casual promisor’ being ‘hooked’ too easily into a contractual relationship as feared by Professor Chen-Wishart. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Surely the fact of the existing contractual relationship in the going transaction scenario attenuates much of such concern.</span> Further, as with any bargain, certainty of terms and proof of mutual intention to be bound will have to be proved by the party seeking to rely on the variation agreement. In any event, the bargain theory of contracts—the notion that contracts are enforced and expectation damages justified because the promisor has been paid the value of the thing promised—is inconsistent with the longstanding enforcement of contracts under seal, or based on nominal consideration of $1.00 or a peppercorn.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">181 While the rationale for the enforcement of going transaction modifications is often based on the realities facing commercial actors in business transactions, friends and neighbours who make significant loans and agreements face similar realities: circumstances change and contractual modifications may be desirable and beneficial to both parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 With respect, the fact that the parties are already in an existing contractual relationship cannot (as we have already explained above at [64]) – in and of itself – justify dispensing with the requirement of consideration in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all</span> cases of contractual variation or modification. There are also a number of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">other </span><span class="font-italic">difficulties</span> that have been set out both above and below. Finally, it is interesting that Bauman CJBC <span class="font-italic">also</span> <span class="font-italic">held</span> (at [177]) that “[i]f one were driven to find consideration here, even in a modified form”, there <span class="font-italic">were</span>, indeed, <span class="font-italic">practical benefits</span> that had flowed to the promisor on the facts of this particular case (at [177]–[178]) – presumably, pursuant to the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Williams</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It remains to be seen whether the courts of the other Canadian provinces will follow the British Columbia Court of Appeal’s clear departure from the conventional approach. It will be seen, therefore, that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Canadian</span> position as a whole is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not as clear as it might appear at first blush</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Further</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">even if</span> the position was clear (in supporting the appellant’s argument that consideration is not required in the context of contractual variation), it is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">equally clear (if not clearer) that there are </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">numerous difficulties</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> with the adoption of such a position</span>. In so far as the former point is concerned, it is also noteworthy that one of the leading textbooks in Canadian contract law merely cites both <span class="font-italic">Williams </span>and <span class="font-italic">NAV</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([74] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>in the footnotes without any attempt to explain the inconsistencies (if any) between both decisions (see S M Waddams, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contracts</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Thomson Reuters, 7th Ed, 2017) at para 138, notes 383, 384 and 385).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 We have examined the relevant case law in some detail in order to demonstrate that it is – at best – inconclusive in so far as support for the proposition that consideration is not required in the context of contractual variation or modification is concerned. Put simply, the doctrine of consideration is still very much a requirement for the variation or modification of existing contracts in so far as the overall case law in the Commonwealth is concerned. <span class="font-italic">Further</span>, and in any event, there are many difficulties that such case law has not addressed. We are therefore not persuaded by the reasons given in those judgments for the departure from the requirement for consideration in the context of contractual variations or modifications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">Fifthly</span> (and this is a point that has been raised by many commentators with regard to the decision in <span class="font-italic">Anton</span><span class="font-italic">s Trawling </span>([67] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)), the <span class="font-italic">broader</span> issue that is raised is whether abolishing the requirement of consideration in the context of contractual variation is the thin end of the legal wedge. Put simply, why should the doctrine of consideration not be abolished with regard to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">formation</span> of contracts as well if the doctrine is indeed abolished in the context of contractual variations (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Ulyatt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 1395; <span class="font-italic">Scott</span> at pp 215−216; <span class="font-italic">Lee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 199 (and, by the same author, <span class="font-italic">Consideration </span>at para 04.060); as well as Marcus Roberts, “Variation contracts in Australia and New Zealand: whither consideration?” (2017) 17 OUCLJ 238 at pp 257–258)? That is a valid question to raise and brings us back – full circle once again – to the more general issue as to whether or not the doctrine of consideration as a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">whole</span> should be abolished (which is a point which we have already dealt with above as well as in the <span class="font-italic">coda</span> to <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>many years earlier).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For the reasons set out above, the appellant’s argument on this particular issue must fail as well. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 We accordingly dismissed the appeal.
