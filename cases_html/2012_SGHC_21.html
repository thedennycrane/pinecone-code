        Tay Yong Kwang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff was the defendant’s husband.
                    They were married in Johor, Malaysia, on 16 November 1980. They have three
                    children – a son aged 25, a daughter aged 21 and another son aged
                    19.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As a result of the breakdown of their
                    relationship, the plaintiff moved out of the matrimonial home in June 2005 and
                    they lived separately thereafter. In July 2005, the defendant filed for judicial
                    separation in D 3063 of 2005. A decree nisi for judicial separation was granted
                    on 7 March 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 11 July 2007, the defendant lodged caveats
                    against two immovable properties registered in the husband’s sole name.
                    The two properties are 47 Hume Avenue #06-02 Parc Palais, Singapore (“the
                    Hume Property”) and 24 Fernwood Terrace #16-02, Singapore (“the
                    Fernwood Property”). In each caveat, the defendant claimed “an
                    estate or interest in the land as beneficiary” by virtue of the
                    properties being matrimonial assets and “a constructive trust in favour
                    of the Caveator inferred from the Registered Proprietor’s conduct and
                    representation to the Caveator that the Caveator would acquire a beneficial
                    share in the said property and/or the proceeds of the sale
                    thereof”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 14 November 2008, the defendant commenced
                    divorce proceedings in D 5652 of 2008. Interim judgment was granted on 10 July
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant and the parties’ three
                    children are currently living in Canada. They have obtained permanent resident
                    status there. The eldest child is working, the second is completing her studies
                    this year and the youngest is also studying in a university.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The originating summons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In this originating summons, the plaintiff asked
                    that he be allowed to mortgage each of the two properties for a sum not
                    exceeding 50% of their respective market values in order to secure credit
                    facilities from DBS Bank. He also sought consequential orders for the defendant
                    to remove her caveats against the properties and costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff wished to obtain additional trade
                    facilities for his company, Vandashima Hi-Tech Materials (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“Vandashima”), from DBS Bank. His company was incorporated in
                    Singapore with a paid-up capital of US$1m, with the plaintiff holding about 98%
                    of its shares. The company is in the business of import and export of chemicals
                    and high-tech materials. Its trade is in US dollar and it requires letters of
                    credit to be issued by the said bank to finance its purchase of materials for
                    export to third parties. The bank’s various credit facilities to the
                    company are S$115,000 by way of overdraft, US$900,000 for import line financing,
                    letters of credit, etc (“the trade limits”) and S$100,000 for
                    foreign exchange lines. The facilities are secured by, among other things, a
                    first charge on the company’s assets and by the husband’s fixed
                    deposit of US$539,925.32.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Due to the depreciating US dollar, the company
                    exceeded the trade limits of the bank on various occasions. To resolve this
                    problem, the company requested the bank to increase the trade limits but the
                    bank was willing to do so only if security was furnished for the increased trade
                    limits. However, the company does not own any other assets which could be put up
                    as security.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The only assets available are the Hume Property
                    and the Fernwood Property. The bank was prepared to consider an increase in the
                    trade limits of up to 50% of the current valuation of the two properties to be
                    secured by a mortgage on the said properties. However, the bank wanted the
                    defendant’s caveats to be lifted first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     According to the plaintiff, the current value
                    of the Hume Property is about $1.1m and that of the Fernwood Property is about
                    $1.5m. His company would therefore be able to increase the trade limits by about
                    S$1.3m (50% of the combined values of the two properties).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Hume Property was purchased by the
                    plaintiff in 1997 as his alternative home because of the marital problems the
                    parties were having. He is presently residing there. The defendant has never
                    resided there and has not contributed financially at all towards this
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Fernwood Property was also paid for solely
                    by the plaintiff. The family resided there between 1997 and 2005. After the
                    plaintiff moved out of this matrimonial home, the defendant and the children
                    continued residing there until they re-located to Canada in 2008. The property
                    is now rented out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff disputed the defendant’s
                    claims to a share in the two properties. On 20 May 2008, he filed originating
                    summons 683 of 2008 to remove the caveat lodged against the Hume Property. On 10
                    July 2009, he commenced originating summons 795 of 2009 to remove the caveat on
                    the Fernwood Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 14 August 2009, Choo Han Teck J dismissed
                    the plaintiff’s originating summons in respect of the Hume Property on the
                    ground that “the spouse who is not a registered co-owner will thus, by
                    virtue of her entitlement to claim a share, have an equitable interest in the
                    property” (see <em>Tan Huat Soon v Lee Mee Leng</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 199 at [5]). The plaintiff
                    did not appeal the decision as he was then not in need of funds for his business
                    and therefore did not need to mortgage the property. Further, he had no
                    intention of selling the two properties and had expected the ancillary matters
                    in the divorce proceedings to be concluded expeditiously. As a consequence of
                    the dismissal of the originating summons pertaining to the Hume Property, the
                    plaintiff withdrew his application in respect of the Fernwood
                Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     However, there was delay in the divorce
                    proceedings caused by the defendant’s refusal to give full and frank
                    disclosure and by the contested applications pertaining to custody and
                    maintenance. In the meantime, the plaintiff’s financial situation has
                    deteriorated and he is now in need of additional trade facilities for
                    Vandashima, his main source of income. The company’s business would be
                    adversely affected, jeopardizing the livelihood of some 40 employees. The
                    plaintiff has also spent over $1m to maintain the children and their overseas
                    education and a similar amount in legal fees for this matrimonial
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff argued that since Choo Han Teck
                    J’s decision was to protect the defendant’s share (if any) in the
                    two properties, allowing him to take up financing of up to 50% of their combined
                    values would not prejudice the defendant in any way. In any case, it was
                    unlikely in the circumstances of the marriage that the defendant would receive a
                    50% share (the percentage claimed by the defendant) in the matrimonial assets.
                    The defendant was well-off, having declared her assets at $2.33m as at 2006,
                    although, the plaintiff submitted, the evidence uncovered showed her assets to
                    be in excess of $6m. She is living with the children in a bungalow in Vancouver,
                    Canada, which was bought by her. His assets as at 2006 amounted to $8.45m. The
                    total assets available for division would therefore be around $14.45m. Should
                    the defendant be awarded 50% of the total matrimonial assets, her share would be
                    about $7.22m and that meant that only $1.2m would come out of the
                    plaintiff’s assets. The balance of 50% of the combined values of the two
                    properties would therefore be sufficient to take care of this eventuality. He
                    has not defaulted in his maintenance obligations for his family for the past six
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As the defendant did not respond to the
                    plaintiff’s request for her consent to lift the caveats, he had no choice
                    but to make this application to court. The defendant was well out of time when
                    she filed her affidavit to oppose this application. The plaintiff did not wish
                    to delay matters further by having to respond to her affidavit and asked that
                    the court disregard her late affidavit which contained untruths and also did not
                    seek to explain the delay in filing. He argued that Choo Han Teck J’s
                    decision in the earlier originating summons did not prejudice this application
                    in view of the change in his financial situation and the fact that he was no
                    longer arguing that the defendant had no interest upon which to lodge a caveat.
                    In any event, the judge appeared to have changed his mind about whether a claim
                    made by a wife in such circumstances could support a caveat (see <em>Lee Chi Lena v Chien Chuen Chi Jeffrey</em> [2011] SGHC
                    91).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As an alternative, the plaintiff asked that he
                    be allowed to mortgage the entire Hume Property, leaving the Fernwood Property
                    intact to await the decision on division of assets by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendant argued that the plaintiff has
                    not shown any documentation to support his alleged need to use the two
                    properties as collateral for his company’s trade facilities. No company
                    statements or bank documents (such as a letter of offer of facilities) have been
                    produced to support his contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff has also not shown the current
                    value of the properties nor has he indicated the value needed as collateral for
                    the alleged facilities. The valuations provided by the plaintiff were informal
                    ones.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendant alleged that this application
                    was the plaintiff’s fresh attempt to dilute and dissipate the matrimonial
                    assets after having failed in one of the earlier originating summonses and
                    having withdrawn the other. No reason was given by him for wanting the caveats
                    lifted then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The parties’ applications for discovery
                    of documents are still pending before the court. Both parties’ forensic
                    accountants’ reports are ready. Just as the plaintiff disputes the
                    defendant’s forensic accountant’s report, the defendant also
                    disputes the plaintiff’s forensic accountant’s report on the
                    defendant’s assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendant’s counsel had no
                    instructions on whether the bungalow in Canada was indeed bought by the
                    defendant. They communicate by email and are hampered by the time difference
                    between Canada and Singapore, While the defendant and the children are Canadian
                    permanent residents, the defendant does return to Singapore to visit her
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Citing Lai Siu Chiu J’s decision in
                        <em>Eu Yee Kai Alexander Junior v Hanson Ingrid
                        Christina</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 586, the defendant submitted that the
                    application for the caveats to be removed should be dismissed as there is
                    “reason for the caveat to remain, so that the defendant’s rights
                    and interests were protected” (at [27] of the judgment). The defendant added that in the same
                    case, another application to remove the caveat was allowed solely because the
                    property was being sold and the purchasers had exercised the option. However,
                    the court ordered that the sale proceeds be held by the solicitors as
                    stakeholders pending the outcome on the division of matrimonial
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendant argued that the purpose of the
                    application, even if it were true, held a risk to the defendant as the ancillary
                    matters are long outstanding in the Family Court. She asked that her rights be
                    preserved pending the conclusion of all the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As acknowledged by the parties, this
                    application does not involve the question whether the defendant has an interest
                    in the properties which could be the subject of the caveats. Instead, it
                    concerns an application by the plaintiff for relief from the harshness of having
                    both his immovable properties rendered commercially useless save for
                    rental.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff has shown a good reason why he
                    needs to use one or both of the properties as collateral security. He has to
                    keep his flagship business operating at optimum strength in the midst of an
                    adverse financial environment. This business provides the bulk of his income by
                    which he maintains himself and his family. It is also the lifeline of several
                    dozen employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     There is no evidence that the plaintiff has
                    neglected his financial obligations to his family over the last six years of the
                    matrimonial proceedings or that he was given to hiding or dissipating assets.
                    The long drawn out ancillary proceedings, possibly due to the acrimony of both
                    parties, should not be allowed to put his life on hold or to destroy his
                    commercial enterprise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The defendant certainly does not appear to be
                    a helpless lady in dire financial straits. On the contrary, she appears to be a
                    confident and capable person, well able to manage her finances and get on with
                    her life. She does not need any of the two properties in issue to maintain a
                    roof over her head. Even if one of the properties should be lost as a result of
                    a mortgagee’s sale, the other property and assets of the plaintiff should
                    be more than enough to make up for its loss. This is on the assumption that the
                    defendant will succeed in her claim for up to 50% of the matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The three children appear to be doing well in
                    their education and financially. The plaintiff has not neglected them during the
                    course of his troubles with their mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Allowing one of the properties to be used as
                    collateral security for the plaintiff’s business will not harm the
                    defendant’s interests, especially if the one of lower value is used.
                    Indeed, it should benefit the parties and the children if Vandashima’s
                    viability is thereby secured. That will help preserve or even enhance the
                    plaintiff’s assets rather than dissipate them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On the facts here, I decided that the
                    plaintiff should be permitted the use of only the Hume Property, for up to 100%
                    of its value, for his company’s commercial needs. This will be a lot
                    neater than having both properties mortgaged for up to 50% of their values as
                    suggested by the plaintiff in his application. It will ensure that the Fernwood
                    Property, which is of higher value, remains available to be given to the
                    defendant if the situation calls for such a move and if the court so decides.
                    The plaintiff’s immediate needs will be taken care of and the
                    defendant’s future interests preserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Accordingly, I ordered the defendant to lift
                    the caveat on the Hume Property while allowing that for the Fernwood Property to
                    remain on the records. The plaintiff would be allowed to mortgage the Hume
                    Property for its entire value. The Registrar of the Supreme Court would have the
                    power to lift the caveat on the Hume Property on the defendant’s behalf
                    should she refuse or neglect to comply within one week of the order. I further
                    ordered the costs of this originating summons to be costs in the cause in the
                    hearing on the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The defendant has appealed against the orders
                    relating to the Hume Property.</p>
