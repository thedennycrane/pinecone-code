        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused Leow Kok Meng pleaded guilty to one
                    charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the
                    Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and one charge of voluntarily causing grievous
                    hurt by means of a knife under s 326 of the Penal Code. He was convicted on
                    the charges and sentenced to life imprisonment for each offence with two
                    offences of vandalism taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
                    The offences were committed on 29 August 2008. The accused was 47 years 10
                    months old at that time, and is 50 years 4 months old now.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The accused had attacked two persons. The person
                    in the first offence was Karunagaran s/o Jaganathan
                    (“Karunagaran”), who died, and the person in the second offence
                    was Balan s/o G Krishnan (“Balan”), who was injured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The accused, Karunagaran and Balan used to hang
                    out in the Mei Ling Street vicinity. They knew one another; Karunagaran and
                    Balan were good friends, but they were not on friendly terms with the accused as
                    the accused had fought with Karunagaran a few years ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       According to the accused, he ran into
                    Karunagaran and Balan on several occasions on the day of the offence, starting
                    from the morning. Karunagaran verbally abused him and his mother in Hokkien, but
                    he kept out of the way of Karunagaran and Balan, and went about attending to his
                    own matters, which included drinking stout and whiskey. When he was returning
                    home in the afternoon, he noted that Karunagaran and Balan were still there.
                    That annoyed him, and when he got home, he retrieved a hunting knife, put it in
                    a sheath, then tucked the knife and sheath under his T-shirt, left his home and
                    went downstairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       What happened next were described in the
                    Statement of Facts which he had admitted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    At about 4.45 p.m., the accused approached Balan
                            who was seated at one of the benches at the fountain area in front of
                            Block 157 Mei Ling Street. The accused pointed the knife at Balan.
                            Without saying a word, the accused attacked Balan with the
                        knife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.    Balan tried to ward off the accused’s
                            attack. Balan asked the accused why he was attacking him, to which the
                            accused replied in a confrontational manner, “what, what”.
                            In the course of the accused’s knife attack, the accused inflicted
                            multiple injuries on Balan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.    At about this time, the deceased came to the
                            fountain area and he saw the accused attacking Balan. The deceased then
                            shouted at the accused. The accused turned his attention towards the
                            deceased and attacked the deceased repeatedly with the knife.
                            Consequently, the accused inflicted multiple incised and stab wounds on
                            the deceased with the intention of causing such bodily injury as was
                            likely to cause death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24.    As a result of the accused’s attack, the
                            deceased staggered and collapsed outside the fountain area. Balan
                            managed to leave the scene and went up to the deceased’s flat at
                            the 16<sup>th</sup> level of Block 154 to inform the
                            deceased’s sister about what had happened to the
                        deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When the police arrived at the scene and arrested the accused, he
                    was in an intoxicated state, speaking incoherently and had to be supported to
                    get to a police car.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The injuries inflicted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Karunagaran died at the scene of the attack.
                    Post-mortem examination revealed that there were 15 stab and incised wounds over
                    different parts of his body. The cause of his death was certified as
                    “multiple stab and incised wounds”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Balan sustained multiple lacerations on his
                    right palm, chest and back. The lacerations to the palm had resulted in 100%
                    cuts to two tendons and a median nerve.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Psychiatric evidence on the accused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Dr Arthur Lee, Senior Consultant
                    Psychiatrist &amp; Acting Chief, Addiction Medicine Department, Institute of
                    Mental Health examined the accused in September 2008. In his report dated
                    13 October 2008, Dr Lee noted that the accused had a history of daily
                    and excessive alcohol consumption going back more than 10 years. In the
                    conclusion of his report, Dr Lee stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    
              <b><u>Diagnosis and
                                Opinion</u></b> – From the information available, my
                            examination of the accused and interviews with his sister and the 3
                            independent Police eye-witnesses (first to arrive at the scene), Mr
                            Leow, <u>an ex-heroin addict (with likely Anti-Social
                                Personality traits and low average intelligence</u>), has
                                <b><u>Alcohol Dependence</u></b>. His family
                            history of alcoholism (2 siblings), recent emergency treatment for
                                <b><u>low brain glucose with alcohol withdrawal
                                seizures at Alexandra Hospital 2 weeks before the alleged
                                incident</u></b>, <u>and past visual
                                hallucinations with recent abnormal liver function tests</u>
                            are all consistent with <b>moderately severe alcohol
                                dependence</b>. Three objective witnesses (all Policemen
                            first on-site, 2 immediately whilst he was still holding the knife) gave
                            independent and concurring accounts of his strong alcoholic smell,
                            overtly intoxicated and abnormal behavior with grossly unsteady gait.
                            His perceptions, delusional belief (that the deceased planned to attack
                            him with a metal rod), judgment and actions at the time of the alleged
                            offence were all likely significantly influenced by his <u>severe Alcohol Intoxication</u> with <u>possible exacerbation of low glucose (skipped
                                lunch)</u>. The accused had <b><u>severe
                                Alcohol Intoxication</u></b> (blood alcohol level likely well
                            above 300mg% at the material time, given that <u>5
                                hours after his arrest, blood alcohol</u> tested remained
                                <u>unusually high at</u><b><u>297mg%</u></b><b>)</b>.
                            In my opinion – even though he was not of unsound mind at the
                            material time, (in that he was aware of the nature and consequence of
                            his actions), his <b>persecutory delusion, impaired
                                judgment, loss of control and incoherence</b> are consistent
                            with <b>alcohol-induced psychosis</b> ie an
                                <b>abnormality of mind which has substantially
                                impaired his mental responsibility for his actions</b>. At
                            present, he is mentally fit to plead and stand trial in
                        Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dr Lee followed up on the report with his
                    opinion on whether the accused would be a serious danger to the public for an
                    indeterminate period of time and whether the accused needed psychiatric care and
                    treatment for an indefinite period of time. In a letter dated 5 October
                    2009, he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the history and mental state of the accused at the time of the
                        alleged offence, 3 areas pertaining to possible future dangerousness in this
                        case are of particular concern:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a    Past history of drug related imprisonment and
                            recidivism – the background of his long term history of substance
                            and alcohol dependence and imprisonment: incarceration at [Drug
                            Rehabilitation Centre] 4 times (heroin addiction) and imprisonment for
                            drug related offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b    
              <b><em>At the time of the alleged
                                offence – his</em></b> [sic] <b><em>had
                                persecutory delusions, impulsive and unrestrained. dangerous
                                acting-out with a knife after severe alcohol intoxication</em></b>
                            leading to the deceased man’s death through multiple
                            stabbing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c    Prognosis for the future – the likelihood of
                            relapse for alcohol dependence and intoxication is high in this case,
                            especially with a strong family history of heavy drinking (2 siblings),
                            his co-morbid substance dependence, antisocial personality traits, lack
                            of remorse and no previous evidence of active engagement nor compliance
                            with treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Treatment and rehabilitation will depend on this accused person’s
                        willingness to fully accept that he has a problem in the area of dependence
                        on alcohol and past substance dependence, insight on the psycho-social
                        consequences of his addictive lifestyle and his commitment to change his
                        behavior and lifestyle. All seem to be lacking in this case and would not
                        likely lead to his voluntary treatment especially in the absence of
                        structured supervision, commitment and accountability</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    In my opinion, the above can be taken as evidence
                            that <em>the accused is likely to pose a serious danger
                                to the public</em>, given the facts, circumstances and
                            psychiatric examination of this case which led to the death of the
                            deceased who was stabbed in broad daylight in public. Hence,
                            involuntary, <b><em>custodial psychiatric care and
                                treatment for an indefinite period of time may be beneficial for his
                                mental well being, sustained sobriety and more importantly, for
                                public safety</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The accused was seen by another psychiatrist,
                    Dr Todd Tomita, Acting Chief &amp; Consultant Psychiatrist, Department of
                    General &amp; Forensic Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health/Woodbridge
                    Hospital. Dr Tomita’s involvement came after the accused was
                    convicted, and the case had moved onto the sentencing phase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In his report dated 27 April 2010,
                    Dr Tomita sets out the accused’s background history:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendant is a 49 year old divorced man. He is a recidivist offender
                        with prior violent convictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">His background history has been reported in detail in previous reports to
                        the Court. In brief, the defendant has a primary three education. He has
                        worked in a variety of odd jobs since then. He reports that his most stable
                        occupation has been in foot reflexology. He reports having worked in the
                        field for 20 years and obtained a certificate of qualification about 10
                        years ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendant reports working at many jobs. He denies having any
                        difficulty with his employers and told me that he was a reliable employee.
                        However, his longest job working as an employee has only been for several
                        months at a time. He told me he usually does odd jobs on contract. He was
                        working in the area of foot reflexology but stopped around 2007 because he
                        injured his left hand. After this, he intermittently helped selling durians
                        near his home.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendant was married for about two years when he was 40 years old. He
                        has had about 10 live in relationships with women, the longest of which
                        lasted five or six years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">the accused’s alcohol and substance use history:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He has had recurrent problems connected with his drinking, which has
                        increased over the years. In the past few years, he told me that he has been
                        drinking daily starting in the morning. Prior to his arrest, his average
                        consumption was 2 or 3 large bottles of beer per day supplemented with
                        whisky about twice per week. He conceded that he was drinking more in order
                        to get the same effect from alcohol and he had cravings for alcohol when not
                        drinking. Although the defendant denied problems with withdrawal or memory
                        problems, Dr. Arthur Lee’s report noted otherwise. Information
                        obtained from the defendant’s sister and Alexandra Hospital records
                        indicated that the defendant had problems with alcoholic blackouts,
                        withdrawal tremours and one episode of alcohol withdrawal seizures resulting
                        in an admission to Alexandra Hospital in 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and the accused’s past violence history:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">His trouble with the law began in his teenage years. He was at [sic] boys
                        home at age 15 for about two years after being arrested for theft. His adult
                        criminal record began when he was in National Service. He was discharged
                        from national Service as a result of criminal convictions and the subsequent
                        prison term. He has had 5 prior sentencing dates for criminal convictions
                        including robbery and armed robbery (1980), extortion (1980), voluntarily
                        causing grievous hurt (1981), using criminal force to deter a public servant
                        (1993), and voluntarily causing grievous hurt and voluntarily causing hurt
                        with a dangerous weapon (1998). He has netted sentences of up to 15 months
                        and caning for 2 of his sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Robbery and armed robbery (1980)</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendant denies committing these offences. A charge of possession of
                        an offensive weapon was also taken into consideration at sentencing. The
                        defendant told me had a knife. The Summary of Facts notes that the defendant
                        and 2 co accused robbed a shopkeeper at knifepoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Voluntarily causing grievous hurt
                        (1981)</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Statement of Facts notes that the defendant was out with friends
                        drinking large amounts of alcohol. An accidental collision led to the victim
                        striking the defendant. The defendant kicked the victim to the ground and
                        stomped on his face 11-12 times. The victim sustained a severe head injury
                        and was in hospital for 2 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Voluntarily causing grievous hurt and voluntarily
                            causing hurt with a dangerous weapon (1998)</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defendant provided a version of these events which was consistent with
                        the Statement of Facts. The defendant met and gambled with the 2 victims. He
                        won and wanted to stop playing. The victims insisted that the defendant
                        continue to play and an argument ensued. The defendant walked over to a
                        nearby shop and took up a knife. He approached the 2 victims and slashed
                        them multiple times in the face, head and shoulders. The defendant told me
                        he had not been drinking much the day of this incident. He estimated
                        consuming 2 bottles of beer. The defendant told me that a bystander
                        witnessed the victims punch the defendant in the face and throw a bottle at
                        him and his testimony in court helped reduce the sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Dr Tomita then presented a Violence Risk
                    Assessment on the accused. In this Assessment, Dr Tomita noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the defendant’s case, there is definite previous violence
                        beginning with a conviction for robbery and armed robbery in 1980. Since
                        then, he has had convictions for extortion (1980), voluntarily causing
                        grievous hurt (1981), using criminal force to deter a public servant (1993),
                        and voluntarily causing grievous hurt and voluntarily causing hurt with a
                        dangerous weapon (1998). It is notable that the 1998 conviction occurred
                        when the defendant was not using much alcohol. It is also notable that the
                        use of a knife has been a regular feature of his offending
                        behaviours.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Leow has definite and serious substance use problems. These have
                        remitted, as he is now unable to readily access alcohol given he is in
                        remand. His substance use has affected his health, interpersonal
                        relationships, and has been a factor in some of his offending including the
                        index crimes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The defendant suffers from an antisocial personality
                            disorder</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The defendant lacks insight</em>. He fails to
                        appreciate the connection between a lifestyle marked by daily drinking and
                        associations with acquaintances who are also substance abusers. He fails to
                        appreciate that his penchant for taking up a knife to resolve disputes is a
                        recipe for a violent outcome. For example, in the index offence he expresses
                        surprise that one of the victims’s [sic] died but also reports the
                        only solution he had to the problems with the victims was to get a knife and
                        confront them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and the Risk Assessment Summary was that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Overall, <b><em>the defendant would be considered in the
                            moderate range of risk for future violence</em></b>. Although
                        moderate, <b><em>his risk is likely to be present over the long
                            term</em></b>. The nature of his violence was predatory when he was
                        young when he committed robberies for personal gain. His offences have
                        become more emotionally driven and triggered by interpersonal conflict as he
                        has grown older. Alcohol use and some degree of intoxication has been a
                        feature of most but not all of his offences. This is important as it
                        highlights the fact that personality-based features such as aggressiveness,
                        lack of remorse or guilt and lack of empathy are factors. Personality traits
                        are by definition long standing and difficult to modify or change. The
                        severity of his violence risk is the most concerning feature in this case.
                        Although there have been only periods of a stability, the most recent
                        offence in 1998 and the index offence involved the defendant wielding a
                        knife and inflicting potential and actual life threatening injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Dr Tomita ended the report with his
                    findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. Clinical Formulation and Psychiatric Diagnosis</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The defendant has problems with alcohol
                            dependence</em> and a temporary alcohol-induced psychosis has been
                        assessed to have contributed to his current offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He is not psychotic now and there is no evidence that he suffers from a
                        major mental illness or any persisting alcohol-induced psychiatric
                        symptoms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He has a past history of substance misuse but stopped using drugs about 15
                        years ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The defendant has an antisocial personality disorder
                            and a moderate level of psychopathy</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>He has failed to conform to social norms and repeatedly
                            committed crimes, shows a lack of remorse, has failed to learn from his
                            experience</em> (including repeated incarcerations), and has an
                        established pattern of aggressiveness and violent behaviour, which has
                        escalated in severity over time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Is there evidence to show that Leow Kok Meng is likely to represent a
                        serious danger to the public for an indeterminate period of time?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although at a moderate risk for violence, <em>his
                            antisocial personality disorder and moderate level of psychopathy in
                            conjunction with alcohol dependence are stable risk elevating features
                            that are likely to remain important factors for at least the next
                            decade</em>. His longstanding habit of abusing substances, alcohol
                        in most recent years, does not bode well for his ability to control his
                        cravings to use when he returns to the community. Unless clear and immediate
                        sanctions remain present such as the prospect of jail or some other
                        sanction, I foresee his ability to maintain control over his alcohol
                        cravings will erode and be lost over time. Based on these considerations,
                            <b><em>the defendant will likely remain at least a moderate
                            level of risk over the long term</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. Consequently, would the subject need psychiatric care and treatment for
                        an indefinite period of time?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Psychiatric treatment per se is not the main requirement in this case. He
                        does not require psychiatric medications or monitoring of a major mental
                        illness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Instead, <em>the defendant requires alcohol treatment in
                            order to develop a relapse plan</em> and gain skills to avoid a
                        return to alcohol misuse once he returns to the community. Abstinence from
                        alcohol is enforced now that he is in the institution; however, even a
                        prolonged period in a controlled environment should not be used to assume
                        control over alcohol has been gained. Treatment must be undertaken and the
                        defendant should avail himself of substance abuse treatment available within
                        the institution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The defendant may also benefit from either
                            psychological counseling or correctional treatment programs</em>
                        targeting anger and aggression problems. Although <em>such
                            programming will not remove his antisocial and psychopathic personality
                            traits</em>, treatment may help him gain better impulse control
                        and decision making skills so that he does not automatically resort to
                        picking up a knife to resolve a future dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Dr Tomita who is attached to the
                    Institute of Mental Health had no knowledge of the treatment facilities that may
                    be available to the accused when he serves his sentence in prison. The
                    prosecution called a representative of the prison services, Salina bte Samion,
                    Assistant Director, Special Population, Psychological and Counselling Services
                    to supply the information. She disclosed that the prison services do not offer
                    programmes for mentally disordered or for alcohol dependence offenders. There
                    is, however, a violence intervention programme which is designed to increase the
                    insight of persons who have committed violent offences of their violent
                    behaviour. This is a voluntary programme for prisoners assessed to have moderate

                            committed within a brief span of a few minutes. In fact, it all happened
                            so fast that the accused person was not even sure who he had attacked
                            first. It was only at the police station that he was informed by the
                            investigating officer that Kana had died.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is to be noted that he did not see
                    Karunagaran or Balan with a metal pipe on that day, and that he had attacked the
                    two victims separately, Balan first before turning to Karunagaran.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In response to the prosecution’s
                    submission that the accused be sentenced to life imprisonment for the offences,
                    defence counsel submitted that the accused did not fall within the second
                    condition of the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria (see [22]). Counsel referred to
                    Dr Tomita’s opinion that the accused was not mentally unsound and did
                    not require psychiatric treatment. Counsel also indicated that the accused will
                    volunteer himself for the anger management programme and seek treatment for his
                    alcohol dependence after his release, and that his family is committed to
                    support him and ensure his rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sentencing considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The accused was liable to be punished with
                    imprisonment for life, or a term of up to 20 years for the offence of culpable
                    homicide not amounting to murder, and to life imprisonment or a term of up to 15
                    years for voluntarily causing grievous hurt. He was also liable to be fined and
                    caned for both offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The prosecution had argued that the accused
                    should be sentenced to life imprisonment for the offences and submitted that the
                        <em>Hodgson</em> criteria are satisfied. The criteria
                    took its name from <em>R v Rowland Jack Forster
                        Hodgson</em> (1982) 52 Cr App R 113 where
                    MacKenna J stated at 114:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the following conditions are satisfied, a sentence of life
                        imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1) where the offence or offences
                        are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) where it
                        appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant’s
                        history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such
                        offences in the future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the
                        consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual
                        offences or crimes of violence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Aniza bte Essa</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 327, the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria and their application to Singapore came
                    under the careful consideration of the Court of Appeal. Chan Sek Keong CJ
                    delivering the judgment of the Court ruled at [34]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, the answer to whether the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria are appropriate in Singapore is ... in the
                        affirmative. The <em>Hodgson</em> criteria fulfil two
                        important functions. The first is that they provide an alternative
                            (<em>ie</em>, alternative to the principle that the
                        highest punishment should only be reserved for the worst types of cases),
                        and equally principled, justification to impose life imprisonment when it is
                        the highest punishment prescribed for an offence on an offender (<em>ie</em>, for the protection of society). The second is
                        that the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria also provide a
                        useful guide to differentiate between when it is appropriate to sentence to
                        life imprisonment dangerous mentally unstable offenders who are a long-term
                        threat to society and when lesser sentences may be meted out to those who
                        suffer from a transient illness who can be rehabilitated and reintegrated
                        into society. They reflect a humane approach to the punishment of mentally
                        unstable offenders, without sacrificing the dominant objective of protecting
                        the community from the likelihood of similar re-offending. Mental illnesses
                        come in many forms and affect cognition and judgment in different degrees -
                        some illnesses are genetic in origin, and some are situation-specific; some
                        need long-term treatment or are not susceptible to treatment, whereas others
                        are treatable. We need to consider, from a penal point of view, what public
                        policy considerations justify keeping mentally unstable offenders in prison
                        for life if it is not necessary to do so in order to protect the public. The
                        only other justification is the need to punish them on the basis of
                        retribution and/or deterrence. But, retribution involves the consideration
                        of the proportionality principle which conflicts with the principle of
                        public protection, and, ... deterrence is not apposite for mentally unstable
                        offenders ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Are the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria
                satisfied?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I had the evidence of the two psychiatrists,
                    Dr Lee and Dr Tomita. Their evidence was not contradicted by any
                    psychiatric evidence. When Dr Tomita was cross-examined by defence counsel,
                    his diagnosis was not challenged, and the cross-examination was focused on the
                    post-conviction management of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     To recapitulate, Dr Lee had concluded
                    that “custodial psychiatric care and treatment for an indefinite period
                    of time may be beneficial for his mental well being, sustained sobriety and more
                    importantly, for public safety” and Dr Tomita’s opinion was
                    that “the defendant will likely remain at least a moderate level of risk
                    over the long term”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The defence conceded that the first <em>Hodgson</em> criterion was met. There could be no question
                    about it – the accused had brutally attacked and killed Karunagaran, and
                    Balan may have suffered the same fate if the accused had not transferred his
                    aggression to Karunagaran.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Defence counsel submitted, against the weight
                    of evidence, that the second <em>Hodgson</em> criterion was
                    not met. The accused was diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder,
                    alcohol dependence and a moderate level of psychopathy. These characteristics
                    made him a person of unstable character. He has a history of anger and of
                    violence with or without the use of knives. The evidence is that he was likely
                    to behave in the same way in the future without intervention. The second
                        <em>Hodgson</em> criterion was satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The third criterion was not specifically
                    addressed, but the answer was obvious. If the accused were to re-offend in the
                    future, the consequences would be serious. I only need to remind myself of
                    Karunagaran and Balan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Having established that the <em>Hodgson</em> criteria were met, I had to consider whether an
                    indeterminate life imprisonment or appropriate determinate sentences were
                    appropriate in this case. To do this, I had to look at the psychiatric evidence
                    and the treatment facilities available to the accused. Dr Tomita had stated
                    that “[p]ersonality traits are by definition long standing and difficult
                    to modify” and he believed that the accused may benefit from treatment
                    for his alcohol dependence and from anger management counselling, but the
                    accused’s anti-social and psychopathic personality traits could not be
                    removed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Dr Tomita’s views had to be
                    considered against the fact that the accused could not receive any treatment for
                    alcohol dependence while he is in prison, and may receive anger management help
                    only if he sought it and was found to be suitable for the
                programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In deciding on the sentences for the accused,
                    I took into account:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the accused’s mental
                        afflictions;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the accused’s history of uncontrollable
                            anger and violence;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the limited treatment available in prison;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the uncertainty that he would recover from the
                            afflictions even with treatment.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">and I sentenced the accused to life imprisonment on the two charges on
                    which he was convicted. The sentences are appropriate and are needed to protect
                    the public from the dire consequences of any repeated outburst of anger and
                    aggression from the accused.</p>
