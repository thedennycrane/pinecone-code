Each of them is presently represented by a different set of defence counsel. In the course of the trial, which was spread over three years, some defence counsel were discharged for various reasons at different junctures and were replaced on each occasion by new sets of counsel. In this Judgment, I refer to Chandroo’s counsel as “DC1”, Kamalnathan’s counsel as “DC2” and Pravinash’s counsel as “DC3” (collectively, “the Defence”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 It is the Prosecution’s case that Pravinash and Kamalnathan, both Malaysians, worked in concert to deliver the Drugs to Chandroo. According to the Prosecution, Chandroo, who is a Singaporean, had ordered the Drugs from a Malaysian drug supplier for S$4,000, and Pravinash and Kamalnathan had been tasked by the said supplier to bring the Drugs to Chandroo from Malaysia. At the time of their arrest at different locations, all of the Drugs were found in Pravinash’s possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Pravinash’s defence is a denial of knowledge of the nature of the Drugs. Pravinash claims that he had simply been assisting Kamalnathan to transport “books”. Kamalnathan’s defence is likewise a denial of knowledge. Kamalnathan claims that the items, later established to be the Drugs, belonged to Pravinash and that he had simply been helping Pravinash find a job in Singapore. He had allegedly harboured a belief at that time that the items in question were “certificates” that were for the purpose of helping Pravinash secure a job in Singapore. Chandroo denies any involvement in the arrangement to traffic the Drugs and provides various explanations for why he had met Pravinash and Kamalnathan on the day of his arrest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 After considering the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I find that the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to each of the accused persons. I accordingly convict all three accused persons of the respective charges they face. I provide below the reasons for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The arrest of the accused persons </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 5 March 2016, at about 5.27pm, Kamalnathan and Pravinash entered Singapore through Woodlands Checkpoint (“the Checkpoint”). Kamalnathan was riding a motorcycle bearing registration number KCP8801, and Pravinash was riding as a pillion passenger. The items later established to be the Drugs were in their possession at the time but had not been discovered at the Checkpoint.

Suren had been giving them instructions on the delivery of the Drugs through Kamalnathan’s handphone. At Kranji MRT station, in a public toilet, the Drugs were placed into a black Adidas haversack (marked “A”) which had been carried by Kamalnathan and Pravinash.

</div> They remained there for about one to two hours. Thereafter, upon receiving further instructions from Suren, the two of them made their way to a different coffee shop five to ten minutes away (“the second coffee shop”). At the second coffee shop, Kamalnathan continued to liaise with Suren over the phone. After about 15 to 20 minutes, Kamalnathan and Pravinash left at 9.17pm for Kranji Road.

He heard Kamalnathan tell Chandroo that they ought to regroup at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop due to the presence of “Police” in the vicinity.

The abettor must have committed an act or illegal omission pursuant to such a plan. Importantly, and although not expressly stated, it may also be gleaned from the line of authorities cited above that in addition to knowing that certain drugs were to be trafficked, the abettor must also know of the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">nature</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> of the drugs </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">intended to be trafficked pursuant to the conspiracy. This is part of the requirement of knowing, and intending to be a part, of the agreement to traffic illicit drugs. Lastly, the abettor must have intended the illicit drugs to be trafficked to someone other than himself. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Critically, these elements are also applicable in cases of a person abetting the trafficking of drugs <span class="font-italic">to himself/herself</span>. In particular, element (c) above comes to the fore in such situations: the abettor who is the purchaser or recipient of the drugs in the conspiracy must <span class="font-italic">not</span> be one who intends those drugs <span class="font-italic">only</span> for his own consumption but one who intends to <span class="font-italic">on-</span><span class="font-italic">traffic (</span>eg,<span class="font-italic"> on-sell, on-deliver, </span><span class="font-italic">on-distribute,</span> or<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">on-transport)</span> the drugs in question to someone else (see <span class="font-italic">Liew Zheng Yang</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> v Public Prosecutor </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2017] 5 SLR 611</span> at [33]–[47]; <span class="font-italic">Ali bin Mohamad </span>at [75]–[85]). This will be relevant for the discussion on Chandroo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As for Kamalnathan who purportedly facilitated the delivery of the Drugs to someone else, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his co-conspirator Chandroo in the present case, the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> elements for the charge against him will be made out once the first two elements (see [40(a)] and [40(b)] above) are satisfied, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Kamalnathan (a) intended to be a party to the agreement to traffic the Drugs to Chandroo, and (b) knew of the general purpose of the agreement, and that the agreed act to traffic the Drugs to Chandroo is unlawful. The third element (see [40(c)] above) is necessarily made out once the first two elements are satisfied, as it follows that Kamalnathan must have intended those illicit drugs to be delivered to Chandroo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I make a quick but important observation as regards the application of the case law reproduced above to the present case. As regards Pravinash and Chandroo, this is uncontroversial. The elements of the offence that have to be proven with respect to each of them are as reproduced at [39] and [40] above respectively. These broadly correspond with the Prosecution’s submissions on the same (see [19] and [21] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For Kamalnathan, he is being charged under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA <span class="font-italic">read with ss 5(2) and</span><span class="font-italic"> 12 of the said Act</span>. Curiously, the Prosecution in their submissions appears to have framed the elements of his alleged offence in the context of a charge under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, absent the abetment by conspiracy limb (see [20] above). That said, this omission does not render the Prosecution’s case defective: if the Prosecution does succeed in proving the elements set out in their submissions, they would indubitably fulfil the requirements of the abetment by conspiracy charge that Kamalnathan faces. If it is shown that Kamalnathan jointly possessed the Drugs with Pravinash, knew that the Drugs were cannabis and intended to traffic the Drugs to Chandroo,

</div>  These records correspond with Pravinash’s testimony. They show both of them entering Singapore on the aforementioned dates. It also bears mention that on these occasions, Pravinash knew or at least strongly suspected that the “brown colour stones” and/or “jama”, which he had passed to customers, were drugs (I explain this subsequently; see [49] and [95(a)] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On 5 March 2016, Pravinash expected the arrangement to be the same, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that they were to deliver drugs to a customer in Singapore. Pravinash met Kamalnathan earlier that day, and saw the latter retrieve the three blocks from the ceiling of the apartment they were in. Pravinash conceded in his long statements that he had <span class="font-italic">assumed</span> that the three blocks were drugs “due to the previous times [he] had entered Singapore with [Kamalnathan] and the things that [Kamalnathan] told [him] to do”.

This does not preclude a finding that they intended to meet on that day to carry out the planned delivery of the Drugs. During the previous drug consignments between 1 March and 4 March 2016, Pravinash had also assisted Kamalnathan in making drug deliveries to <span class="font-italic">strangers</span>. According to Pravinash, their <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> was consistent: Kamalnathan and Pravinash would head to the Kranji area; there, the former would identify the intended customer whose identity, up to that point, would have been a mystery to them.

</div> These show that Kamalnathan could, and in fact did, identify the intended recipient of the Drugs: Chandroo. That Chandroo responded to Kamalnathan shows that Chandroo was in on the act as well. The only logical conclusion is that the meeting between the three of them was certainly not serendipitous or unplanned. I see no reason to reject Pravinash’s account, which is consistent, corroborated, and is in fact self-incriminating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Chandroo’s evidence to a certain extent also confirms this.

</div> Kamalnathan insists that he had told the officers who recorded his statements about the separate existence of “agent <span class="font-italic">abang</span>”, but they had failed to record this. This however was never put to any of the relevant officers, and Kamalnathan accordingly cannot now rely on such an argument (see <span class="font-italic">Harven a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 771 (“<span class="font-italic">Harven</span>”) at [66]). The above shows that the story involving “agent <span class="font-italic">abang</span>” is an afterthought on Chandroo’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, Kamalnathan has not adduced a shred of evidence evincing the existence of “agent <span class="font-italic">abang</span>”. In fact, the available evidence points to the opposite conclusion: “agent <span class="font-italic">abang</span>” does not exist. Pravinash and Chandroo both testify that there was an agreement to regroup at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop after the three of them had met along Kranji Road.

</div> Pravinash also confirms that they did so to evade CNB officers; conceivably, the plan to regroup was to facilitate the smooth delivery of the Drugs to Chandroo at a location where they believed CNB officers would not be present. Kamalnathan has not convincingly disputed their evidence. If Chandroo was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the intended recipient of the Drugs, and if Kamalnathan knew this, why did Kamalnathan instruct Chandroo to regroup at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop? It is Kamalnathan’s own position that Suren informed him over the phone <span class="font-italic">during </span>the meeting at Kranji Road that “agent <span class="font-italic">abang</span>” was not at Kranji Road, but at the overhead bridge outside Kranji MRT station. If so, surely Kamalnathan would not have arranged for a subsequent rendezvous at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop but would have instead made a beeline for Kranji MRT station together with Pravinash. While Kamalnathan asserts that he did so, his evidence flies in the face of what both Chandroo and Pravinash have stated and what the CNB officers have observed; in fact, Pravinash’s evidence is, as mentioned, <span class="font-italic">self-incriminating</span>, and no reason has been offered as to why Pravinash would lie about this matter. Tellingly, when confronted with this issue during cross-examination, Kamalnathan could only offer a bare denial.

I will explain this in greater detail when discussing Kamalnathan’s account of the <span class="font-italic">p</span><span class="font-italic">urpose</span> of the accused persons’ meeting at Kranji Road (see [63]–[67] below). For present purposes, based on the reasons above, it is apparent to me that Kamalnathan changed his evidence during trial in an attempt to exculpate himself. He attempts to distance himself from the Drugs. By (a) suggesting that Chandroo was <span class="font-italic">not </span>the intended recipient of the Drugs, and (b) asserting that there was a different recipient in his mind, Kamalnathan conceivably thought that he could deny involvement in the transaction even if Chandroo came clean and pointed the finger at him. However, as explained, his story is defective on multiple counts, and irreconcilable with Pravinash’s and Chandroo’s testimony. I therefore reject Kamalnathan’s assertion that he did not intend to meet Chandroo on the day of their arrest. It is clear to me that Chandroo was, at all times, the person who Pravinash and Kamalnathan planned to meet on 5 March 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The next question that arises concerns the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> of the meeting along Kranji Road that evening.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The purpose of the meeting on 5 March 2016</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On this issue, I prefer Pravinash’s evidence as canvassed earlier (see [47] above), and reject Kamalnathan’s and Chandroo’s evidence.

His substantive defence is a different one – he denies knowing the true nature of the contents inside the three blocks. This defence does not detract from the fact that his evidence on the purpose of the meeting at Kranji Road only served to further implicate him, as it demonstrates his involvement in what he knew was an illegal enterprise.

I am totally unpersuaded by Kamalnathan’s repeated assertions that Pravinash was the one in charge of the entire operation, and that he had merely been sent to Singapore to help Pravinash secure a job. As noted, Pravinash and Kamalnathan had entered Singapore in the days preceding their arrest to carry out several successful drug deliveries (see [48] above). What is pertinent is that the toll records and Kamalnathan’s phone records paint a clear picture of who had been in charge all this while. I have alluded to this in my earlier analysis of the documentary evidence (see [50]–[53] above). To reiterate, I am satisfied that it was Kamalnathan, <span class="font-italic">not </span>Pravinash, who had always been in contact with Suren at the material time. This was also the arrangement on 5 March 2016. Kamalnathan received instructions from Suren and acted upon them; Pravinash simply followed his lead.

</div> If Suren wished to liaise with Pravinash, he could have easily done so. That he did not points strongly to the conclusion that Pravinash was never the one in charge of the drug delivery operations. The significance of my finding in this regard is clear: Kamalnathan was repeatedly and dishonestly trying to shift the blame to Pravinash.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The aforementioned discrepancies in Kamalnathan’s evidence naturally deal a significant blow to his credibility. Kamalnathan is obviously trying to play down his culpability. He backtracks from a self-incriminating position. He recants his statement that he had brought drugs into Singapore, and instead characterises the meeting with Chandroo as an innocuous one involving the delivery of “certificates” in support of Pravinash’s job search in Singapore. He also paints Pravinash as the mastermind, and himself as a blind follower. In the circumstances, I am not persuaded by his evidence. To be clear, I accept that there may be some truth to Kamalnathan’s narrative on the “certificates”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there was some semblance of a plan to help Pravinash secure a job in Singapore. Pravinash alluded to this in his long statements.

</div> Accordingly, and for the above reasons, I am of the view that Kamalnathan is only being partially truthful in his “certificates” narrative. He may have agreed to help Pravinash find a job in Singapore. However, he deliberately omits a most critical detail: they had entered Singapore that day (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 March 2016) with the clear and specific purpose of delivering the Drugs to Chandroo; helping Pravinash find a job in Singapore might well have been on their agenda <span class="font-italic">but </span><span class="font-italic">for another time and on another day</span>. I do not believe that there was any arrangement to meet an employment agent in Singapore who was to be handed any of Pravinash’s certificates late that same evening on 5 March 2016. Chandroo never once said that he was an employment agent. No other person claiming to be an employment agent had appeared on the scene to meet up with Kamalnathan and Pravinash late that same evening in relation to job offers or the collection of Pravinash’s certificates.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Chandroo’s evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Chandroo’s version of events equally cannot stand up to scrutiny. Chandroo testifies that he had met Pravinash and Kamalnathan for the purpose of passing them money that was to be returned to Kumar, his friend in Malaysia. Several aspects of his evidence, however, are deficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 First, his account of events is not cogent. In his contemporaneous statement, Chandroo’s position is that all of the S$4,000 found on him was to be returned to Kumar, because the latter had loaned him the same amount.

It would have been extremely inconvenient for Chandroo to have counted and repacked the money there and then, when he would have had ample time to do so <span class="font-italic">before</span> meeting Pravinash and Kamalnathan.

</div> In the light of this, Chandroo’s version of events that the meeting was for him to pass money to Pravinash and Kamalnathan to return a loan to Kumar in Malaysia must be rejected. Both Pravinash and Kamalnathan do not allude in their testimony to any collection of loan money on behalf of Kumar from Chandroo.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 From the above, it is clear that Pravinash’s testimony on the purpose of the meeting at Kranji Road is the most cogent and credible.

I again accept Pravinash’s account of events, which is largely clear and consistent. He testifies that Kamalnathan was the one who identified and established contact with Chandroo. Pravinash then saw Kamalnathan receive “a Singapore $10 note” from Chandroo, as well as “two white plastic bags”.

</div> While there is a minor inconsistency in his evidence as regards the money passed to Kamalnathan (Pravinash confirms that he only saw S$10 being exchanged, whereas Chandroo and Kamalnathan claim it was S$20), I do not see this as consequential. Furthermore, the exchange took place at night and as such, Pravinash might not have had a clear view of the amount of money that Chandroo passed over to Kamalnathan. What is material is that it is undisputed that some money had in fact been passed by Chandroo to Kamalnathan. As for the plastic bags, Kamalnathan subsequently handed these over to Pravinash, who then kept them in the black Adidas haversack. Pravinash also heard Kamalnathan giving Chandroo instructions to regroup at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop. Kamalnathan did so because Pravinash had alerted him to the presence of “Police” in the vicinity.

</div> This important fact of having to meet again at another location emanating from Chandroo by and large mirrors Pravinash’s evidence.

Pravinash’s and Kamalnathan’s evidence is that there were two plastic bags; indeed, two plastic bags were in fact recovered by the CNB officers (marked “A1” and “A2” respectively). More importantly, what is crucial is that Chandroo accepts that an exchange of this nature occurred with Kamalnathan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Kamalnathan’s evidence on the specific events at Kranji Road is, yet again, inconsistent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) His initial evidence in his long statements is that Pravinash, not Suren, pointed him to the direction of Chandroo.

He also claims that when they met, Chandroo handed “some plastic bags” to Pravinash.

</div> In the light of the conspicuous internal contradictions in his evidence, his lack of credibility (see [67] and [74] above), and Pravinash’s consistent evidence to the contrary, I disregard this portion of Kamalnathan’s testimony.

</div> I agree that there would have been no good reason to regroup if the intended transaction was merely an innocuous one such as a handing over of educational certificates or monies for the repayment of a loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Indeed, the fact that a second meeting (at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop) was convened casts serious doubt over both Kamalnathan’s and Chandroo’s evidence on the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> of the meeting. If Kamalnathan and Pravinash were indeed intending to hand over “certificates” to someone in Singapore at the meeting, why would Kamalnathan see the need to convene a second meeting at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop? The certificates could simply have been handed over at Kranji Road. Kamalnathan does not satisfactorily explain or justify the need for the second meeting at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop. Likewise, Chandroo could have simply handed the money he owed Kumar over to Pravinash and Kamalnathan at Kranji Road. There is again no need for a second meeting at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop, and no satisfactory explanation has been provided by Chandroo for the same. Both Kamalnathan and Chandroo have not offered any reasons to explain why Pravinash would have lied about the reason for the regrouping at the Kranji MRT station coffee shop, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a detection of the presence of CNB officers in the vicinity of Kranji Road where they had first met up. Indeed, there were undercover CNB officers nearby trailing and observing them discreetly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The same may be said as regards Chandroo’s handing over of two plastic bags to Kamalnathan.

</div> and Pravinash takes no position, simply stating that he saw the plastic bags being handed over. Even so, this uncertainty is inconsequential. What is important is this: why did the plastic bags have to be handed over if the sole purport of the meeting was for Kamalnathan to hand “certificates” over to Chandroo, and/or for Chandroo to return money to Kumar via Pravinash and Kamalnathan? When confronted with this fact, Kamalnathan’s response was self-evidently unsatisfactory:

Pravinash’s and Kamalnathan’s subsequent actions reveal the true reason for the giving of the plastic bags, and that Kamalnathan was privy to this: as noted earlier (see [26] above), Pravinash stated that at the industrial area near Kranji Road, he and Kamalnathan had placed the three blocks into one of the plastic bags. Again, Kamalnathan has not provided reasons for why Pravinash’s self-incriminating evidence in this regard should not be accepted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 As for Chandroo, he has simply offered no convincing reason for his handing over of the plastic bags.

That was the reason why after being handed the plastic bags, Kamalnathan and Pravinash subsequently rode off to a secluded location, took out the Drugs from the black Adidas haversack they had with them and placed the Drugs into one of the plastic bags with the intention to hand the plastic bag with the Drugs inside to Chandroo.

A difficulty with the Prosecution’s case is that Pravinash’s alleged mention of the word “ganja” was not recorded in Pravinash’s contemporaneous statement.

However, even in the absence of such a signed statement, SSS Kannan, a CNB officer who gave evidence under oath, has testified that Pravinash did mention the word “ganja”.

In the absence of any evidence of foul play or any motive or conspiracy on the part of these officers to frame Pravinash, I am persuaded that their testimonies are truthful.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">At this juncture, I take the opportunity to address the allegations made by Pravinash in his further set of written closing submissions dated 15 September 2020. In essence, Pravinash alleges that there is a real dispute as to whether he had been taken to the Singapore Turf Club (located one minute away from Kranji MRT station) after his arrest; consequently, issues arise as to (a) the veracity of SSS Kannan’s evidence; and (b) the chain of custody of the Drugs. I find Pravinash’s allegations to be without merit for the following reasons:</span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I accept that the Prosecution’s case with respect to SSS Kannan is not perfect, and there are certain questions over the sequence of events. Such questions arise because the fact that Pravinash had been brought to the Singapore Turf Club is not consistently mentioned in the CNB officers’ conditioned statements. With that said, my analysis at [93] above is pertinent. There is no proof that the <span class="font-italic">corroborated</span> evidence of the various CNB officers is a product of a malicious conspiracy. DC3 has not explained why SSS Kannan and his colleagues would go out of their way to frame Pravinash. More importantly, SSS Kannan and his colleagues stand to gain <span class="font-italic">nothing</span> from further “embellishing” their testimony with the inclusion of the Singapore Turf Club detail. This detail neither strengthens nor weakens the Prosecution’s case – it is simply a detail. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the CNB officers had been dishonest about their account of events concerning the Singapore Turf Club.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As for the chain of custody, I do not understand Pravinash’s argument. Whether or not SSS Kannan and his colleagues did bring Pravinash to the Singapore Turf Club has <span class="font-italic">no bearing whatsoever</span> on the question of <span class="font-italic">who had possession of the black Adidas haversack</span>. Even taking DC3’s argument at its highest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the location of SSS Kannan and Pravinash in the moments after his arrest is unclear, this does <span class="font-italic">not</span> change the fact that the black Adidas haversack remained with the arresting officers throughout. Pravinash has not adduced evidence to the contrary. Nor has it been put to the relevant CNB officers, including SSS Kannan, that there was tampering or a failure to account for the whereabouts of the black Adidas haversack. This specific issue was never meaningfully explored. I accordingly do not accept that there was a break in the chain of custody.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">95 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">It stands to reason, then, that the evidence of SSS Kannan establishes that Pravinash knew that the three blocks were cannabis. The rest of the Prosecution’s arguments on actual knowledge strengthen this conclusion.</span>

</div> The probable inference then is that he knew he was bringing illicit drugs into Singapore on that occasion and hence, he wanted some spiritual blessing.

It is also clear that Pravinash has not rebutted this presumption. My analysis in the preceding paragraphs concerning Pravinash’s actual knowledge in fact buttresses the unrebutted presumption of knowledge that the three blocks comprising the Drugs were cannabis. Moreover, it is well-entrenched authority that an accused will not be able to rebut the s 18(2) presumption simply by claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he had been carrying; he must go further by giving an account of what he thought it was (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2017] 1 SLR 633 (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Obeng Comfort</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”) at [39])</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.

Kamalnathan has not meaningfully challenged these aspects of the evidence. Each of these transactions involved various quantities of what appears to be different types of drugs, and all were conducted under Kamalnathan’s charge. On each occasion, the drugs had been in Kamalnathan’s possession prior to delivery. The transactions were always conducted covertly, at a desolate location near Kranji MRT station.

I am not satisfied that he has displaced this presumption, because he was the one in charge of the Drug consignment, and clearly knew that he and Pravinash had been in possession of illicit drugs on 5 March 2016. Their prior entries into Singapore for the purpose of trafficking in various drugs from 1 March to 4 March 2020, the surreptitious nature of the meeting at Kranji Road, and Kamalnathan’s central role in the attempted delivery of the Drugs all serve to buttress the presumption that he knew of the nature of the Drugs. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">114 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Finally, on authority of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Obeng Comfort</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> ([</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">97] </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">supra</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, even if Kamalnathan did not know that the Drugs were cannabis specifically, this would be insufficient to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA.

This does not mean that there could not have been an arrangement between them made through a third party, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Suren, who was in contact with both Chandroo and Kamalnathan. The fact remains that Kamalnathan managed to identify Chandroo at Kranji Road based on the physical features of Chandroo’s motorcycle. The irresistible inference is that Chandroo had agreed with Suren, Pandian, or one of their associates, to purchase the Drugs, and that this plan was executed by Pravinash and Kamalnathan, with details of identification of Chandroo provided by Suren to Kamalnathan. It did not matter to Chandroo who Pravinash and Kamalnathan were; he had arranged to purchase the Drugs, and knew that the Malaysian drug syndicate would send people to facilitate the transaction on 5 March 2016. That he was not <span class="font-italic">personally acquainted</span> with Pravinash and Kamalnathan is entirely irrelevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">118 </span>Two further questions require consideration, which concern Chandroo’s knowledge of the nature of the Drugs, and whether he had an intention to on-traffic the same.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Chandroo had knowledge of the nature of the Drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">119 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In my view, there is no doubt that Chandroo knew that the Drugs were cannabis. He was the intended recipient and purchaser of the Drugs, and was privy to the plan to traffic the Drugs to him. I have explained why this is so (see [60]–[83] above). That being the case, several conclusions follow as a matter of course. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">120 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">First, and having rejected Chandroo’s testimony that the S$4,000 found on him was meant to be returned to Kumar, it is clear that this money was meant to be payment for the Drugs which he had purchased. As mentioned, the S$4,000 was bundled together, secured with a single rubber band, and placed in a single envelope. All of these factors point to the irresistible conclusion that the bundled lump sum of money was to be handed over in a single transaction in exchange for the Drugs. Chandroo has not convinced me otherwise. Second, as the purchaser of the Drugs, Chandroo must have known what he was purchasing. I find it hard to believe that anyone would pay S$4,000 for an unknown type and quantity of drugs.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">121 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The rest of the evidence only fortifies my conclusions. As pointed out by the Prosecution, the meeting was surreptitiously conducted at night along Kranji Road.</span>

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Further, and in line with my earlier observation (see [81] above), the plastic bags handed by Chandroo to Kamalnathan were meant to be used as carrier bags for the Drugs. Finally, and as made clear in the course of this Judgment, Chandroo has been dishonest on multiple counts (see [68]–[74] above). I thus reject DC1’s submissions on this issue, which hinge on the veracity of Chandroo’s testimony.</span>

</div> I agree with this inference. Chandroo has adduced no evidence demonstrating that he had such a heavy cannabis consumption pattern that would warrant him purchasing 1,344.5g of cannabis for a large sum of S$4,000 in one fell swoop. In fact, Chandroo has not run a defence of consumption at all. His case, as mentioned, is that he met Pravinash and Kamalnathan to facilitate his returning of money to Kumar. Thus, and unsurprisingly, he has not led evidence of his consumption pattern that may have aided him in this regard. In the light of the above, the necessary and irresistible inference remaining is that Chandroo intended to <span class="font-italic">on-traffic</span> the Drugs to other persons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">124 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The third and final element of the offence is thus also made out.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Chandroo</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">125 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Accordingly, the elements of the offence under s 5(1)(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">) read with </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ss 5(2) and 12 of the MDA are made out beyond a reasonable doubt.
