<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Registrar’s Appeal No 165 of 2010 is
                    an appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s (“AR”) decision
                    to dismiss Summons No 423 of 2010, which is the defendants’
                    application to strike out the plaintiff’s entire statement of claim. This
                    is pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) on the basis that it
                    discloses no reasonable cause of action. The guiding considerations for the
                    purposes of a striking out action were succinctly restated in <em>Gabriel Peters &amp; Partners (Suing as a Firm) v Wee Chong Jin and
                        others</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The guiding principle in determining what a “reasonable cause of
                        action” is under O18 r19(1)(<em>a</em>) was
                        succinctly pronounced by Lord Pearson in <em>Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association</em> [1970]
                        1 All ER 1094. A reasonable cause of action, according to his lordship,
                        connotes a cause of action which has some chance of success when only the
                        allegations in the pleading are considered. As long as the statement of
                        claim discloses some cause of action, or raises some question fit to be
                        decided at the trial, the mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely
                        to succeed is no ground for striking it out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A striking out is warranted in such circumstances for several larger
                    policy reasons including, “to allow the case to go further for trial
                    would be to compel the defendants to expend time and money in defending a case
                    which obviously had no merit whatsoever” (<em>per</em> Chao Hick Tin JA, in <em>Bandung Shipping Pte
                        Ltd v Keppel Tat Lee Bank Ltd</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 295 at
                    [34]) and in order not to clog up the courts with such cases.</p>

                            second defendant.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff, formerly sales manager of the
                    company, had subscribed for 21,000 shares at S$1.52 and received 9000 bonus
                    shares at S$1.00. He agreed to sell all his shares in the company in April 2007
                    to the second defendant, for S$2.80.The first and second defendants were
                    directors and shareholders of the third defendant company. At the material time
                    of his sale, the plaintiff held 10% of the company’s issued shares, the
                    first defendant 60%, the second defendant 20% and the third party 10%. The first
                    and second defendants had entered an agreement on 2 April 2007 to sell
                    160,000 shares (40% of the outstanding and issued shares of the company) to a
                    new party at S$10 per share to be completed on 15 May 2007. The foundation
                    of the plaintiff’s complaint is that the first and second defendants had
                    not then disclosed or obtained his consent to this new agreement prior to his
                    sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff first claims that he had a
                    contractual right of disclosure and consent with the first and second
                    defendants. The primary contractual rights claimed by the plaintiff relate to
                    rights of pre-emption/anti-dilution (cl 2.7) and the right of consent to
                    the entry of new shareholders whether by transfer or allotment (cl 11) as
                    provided in the POA. However, he has been unable to produce any POA in which he
                    is a named signatory with them. Instead he relies on an unsigned POA dated
                    1 September 2005 in which he is named as one of the parties. He next relies
                    on a POA dated 1 March 2006, signed by the named parties. This POA however
                    does not contain his name or signature. Nevertheless, the plaintiff insists that
                    he had signed a POA with the defendants which he has been unable to produce. The
                    plaintiff had obtained an Anton Piller/Search order (“Search
                    order”) against the defendants and to date has not been able to produce a
                    copy of the POA with the defendants in which he is named and is a signatory. All
                    the plaintiff has been able to produce is a draft in which he is named but which
                    is unsigned by any of the named persons including himself. The only signed POA
                    in evidence is that of the POA signed by three other named parties to which the
                    plaintiff is neither named nor a signatory. There is accordingly no evidence of
                    a POA to which the plaintiff is a named party and signatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In lieu of producing a POA to which he is a
                    named party and signatory, the plaintiff relies on the defendants’
                    affidavit verifying the list of documents which refers in Item 125 to
                    “1 March 2006 Points of Agreement for Share Holders and Operations
                    of Anewtech Systems Ptd Ltd” to assert that this affidavit constitutes an
                    admission of a POA to which he is a named party and signatory. The plaintiff
                    submits that by reason only of the reference in an affidavit verifying the list
                    of documents by description that “there is no reason for the Court or
                    anybody to challenge either the authenticity nor that it purports to have been
                    written and executed by the parties named therein”. That he does so even
                    in the face of the POA being produced thereunder revealing no signature of the
                    plaintiff, is a remarkable proposition. The plaintiff relies on <em>Koh Teck Hee (trading as Mui Teck Heng Garments &amp; Trading Co) v
                        Leow Swee Lim (trading as Meyoung Trading)</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 328 at [18]–[20] for this proposition. A reading of the
                    case discloses that it provides no such support as suggested by the plaintiff.
                    Secondly, the plaintiff argues that the fact that the first and second
                    defendants subsequently entered into a fresh POA with a new party on 6 May
                    2007 signifies that an earlier one would have existed between the first and
                    second defendants and the plaintiff. However, the subsequent entry of a POA
                    between the defendants and a new party to which the plaintiff was not a party
                    similarly carries no compelling or necessary implication that the plaintiff was
                    thereby a party to an earlier POA with the first and second
                defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The defendants explained the unsigned and signed
                    POA s. All the named signatories in the unsigned POA s were also required to
                    sign personal and several bank guarantee for banking facilities to the company
                    and the plaintiff not being prepared to sign such bank guarantees had then
                    declined to sign the POA. Accordingly, the POA was signed only by those who had
                    signed the personal and several bank guarantees and the plaintiff had signed
                    neither. It would be strange that the plaintiff making an investment of this
                    magnitude in a start up company would not himself have retained in his
                    possession a copy of the POA duly signed by all parties, including himself, if
                    one exists. It is even stranger that having had the benefit of and having
                    conducted a Search order against the defendants, that no such agreement appears
                    to exist in the hands of the defendants either. Accordingly, the foundation of
                    the plaintiff’s claim on contractual POA rights against the first and
                    second defendants is <em>in limine</em> unsupportable as
                    there is no evidence of the existence of any such agreement to which he was a
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff next seeks to nullify the sale of
                    his shares to the defendants on the basis of it having been a breach of
                    article 43 of the company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association,
                    which he says required the consent of all shareholders. The plaintiff admits
                    that there has been no breach of article 43, after he had ceased to be a
                    shareholder arising from the subsequent issue and allotment of new shares, as
                    these were duly approved by shareholders at the time of issue. What the
                    plaintiff avers is focussed on the first and second defendants’ conduct,
                    that they should not have entered an agreement with the new party whilst he was
                    a shareholder without prior disclosure to him and his consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Most crucially however, article 43 reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by the company
                        in general meeting, all new shares shall, before issue, be offered to such
                        persons as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the
                        company of general meeting in proportion, as nearly as the circumstances
                        admit, to the amount of the existing shares to which they are entitled. The
                        offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and
                        limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to
                        be declined and after the expiration of that time, or on the receipt of an
                        intimation from the person to whom the offer is made that he declines to
                        accept the shares offered, the directors may dispose of those shares in such
                        manner as they think most beneficial to the company. The directors may
                        likewise so dispose of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio which
                        the new shares bear to shares held by persons entitled to an offer of new
                        shares) cannot, in the opinion of the directors, be conveniently offered
                        under this article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Article 43 does not confer a veto right or require the consent of
                    all shareholders including the plaintiff to the issue of new shares. It is in
                    the nature of an anti-dilution provision. It provides a <em>pro
                        rata</em> right of first refusal to existing shareholders to subscribe
                        <em>pro rata</em> to any new shares issued by the
                    company. Where the shareholder declines his right of first refusal, the
                    directors may dispose of such shares in the matter they think most beneficial to
                    the company. The plaintiff avers that article 43 further imposes a positive
                    duty on the defendants to first notify and disclose to him as shareholder, the
                    terms of any agreement for the sale of shares in the company. Article 43 by
                    its terms does no such thing. There is accordingly <em>ex
                        facie</em>, no breach of article 43 of the company’s
                    Articles of Association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Finally and in the alternative, the plaintiff
                    seeks an order to wind up the company under s 216 of the Companies Act, on
                    grounds of oppression of minority shareholders. Section 216 of the
                    Companies Act provides a statutory remedial process for shareholder disputes. It
                    is a statutorily prescribed precondition that a person invoking s 216 of
                    the Companies Act must first have the <em>locus standi</em>
                    of being a member of the company, <em>ie</em>, registered
                    in the company’s register of members, which is quite apart from satisfying
                    the substantive conditions set out therein. It was conceded by the plaintiff
                    that by reason of his prior sale of his shares, he had ceased to be a member of
                    the company at the time he filed this action. The plaintiff, however, seeks to
                    rely on <em>Kitnasamy s/o Marudapan v Nagatheran s/o
                        Manogar</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 542 (“<em>Kitnasamy</em>”) to overcome this obstacle. In <em>Kitnasamy</em>, the Court of Appeal noted on the facts that
                    although a Registry of Companies search did not show that the appellant was a
                    registered shareholder of the company, that was not conclusive as the company
                    auditor confirmed that the appellant was a registered shareholder and that the
                    Registry records would be updated after the annual returns were filed. The court
                    found that there was some evidence that he was the registered shareholder. The
                    Court of Appeal further observed at [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the facts as pleaded by the appellant, even if he was not a registered
                        shareholder, it seemed to us that this was an instance where the appellant
                        had agreed to become a shareholder of the company and had rendered
                        invaluable services to it and due to the default of those responsible for
                        the administration of the company, including the respondents, the
                        appellant’s name as a shareholder was not entered in the register of
                        the company. The belief of the appellant that he was a member was reinforced
                        by the fact that the notice of an EGM scheduled for 14 January 2000,
                        together with a proxy form, were despatched to him. Such documents are only
                        despatched to members. The respondents were thus estopped from asserting
                        that the appellant was not a member.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In short, in <em>Kitnasamy</em>, there was found
                    to be other evidence (apart from the company’s register of members) and
                    emanating from the company which confirmed that the plaintiff was a member of
                    the company. The plaintiff here however, was unable to adduce any unequivocal
                    evidence so as to satisfy the s 216, Companies Act precondition of
                        <em>locus standi</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff next sought to rely on the
                    Malaysian case of <em>Owen Sim Liang Khui v Piasau Jaya Sdn Bhd
                        &amp; Anor</em> [1996] 1 MLJ 113 (“<em>Owen</em>”) which was cited in <em>Kitnasamy</em>, where the company having exercised its lien over the
                    plaintiff’s shares for debts owing by him to the company pursuant to its
                    articles of association, had thereby caused the plaintiff to cease to be a
                    member of the company. In the factual circumstances, the Malaysian court
                    concluded such conduct to have been “unconscionable or
                    inequitable” and did not permit the company to use the statute as an
                    engine of fraud. The plaintiff here submitted that this court should similarly
                    not allow an expropriation of the shares of a member to deny an action under
                    s 216 of the Companies Act. <em>Owen</em> is limited
                    to its facts and distinguishable. Apart from anything else, there was a
                    voluntary sale of shares by the plaintiff and no expropriation by the company.
                    The plaintiff avers that having sold his shares without the defendants’
                    disclosure to him of their prior agreement to sell shares to a new party, he had
                    been deceived and accordingly the defendants should to be estopped from raising
                    his lack of <em>locus standi</em> required under s 216
                    of the Companies Act. Absent any contractual obligation or prescription in the
                    memorandum and articles of association of the company or any unequivocal conduct
                    on the part of the defendants or the company set out in the statement of claim
                    which would evince any estoppel, he does not have the locus standi to invoke the
                    intra shareholder remedies under s 216 of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On the substantive requirements of s 216
                    of the Companies Act, the question was put to the plaintiff as to what exactly
                    were the pleaded fiduciary duties owed and breached by the defendants <em>qua</em> directors to the plaintiff shareholder, or by the
                    defendants <em>qua</em> shareholders to the plaintiff
                        <em>qua</em> shareholder. The plaintiff averred that
                    there was nothing more than the breach of the POA and article 43 of the
                    articles of association of the company. These, without more, do not disclose any
                    reasonable cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On the declaration sought by the plaintiff
                    with respect to a breach of the POA, no reasonable cause of action is disclosed
                    because he is not a party to POA. On the declaration relating to article 43
                    of the company’s articles of association, since there is similarly no
                    breach of article 43 <em>ex facie</em>, his statement
                    of claim on this count discloses no reasonable cause of action. His alternative
                    claim to wind up the company on the grounds of oppression again discloses no
                    reasonable cause of action insofar as it relates to the issue of <em>locus standi</em> and also further on the substantive
                    grounds, as these are pleaded and conceded to be founded only on the POA and a
                    breach of article 43.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In order to afford the plaintiff a further
                    opportunity to demonstrate a reasonable cause of action in his statement of
                    claim, I invited the plaintiff to apply for leave to amend his statement of
                    claim. If his draft amended statement of claim disclosed a reasonable cause of
                    action, I would have been prepared to grant leave to amend and make appropriate
                    consequential orders with respect to costs thrown away to date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff filed Summons No 4214 of
                    2010 for leave to amend and submitted a draft amendment to the statement of
                    claim which discloses the following new grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff now avers that there was an bonus
                            share allotment in which all parties including the plaintiff signed a
                            Dividend Shareholders Agreement under which they agreed, <em>inter alia</em>, that “All shareholders are
                            not allowed to sell this share to any 3<sup>rd</sup>
                            parties without the approval or consent of the company directors and
                            respective shareholders.”; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff now avers that the plaintiff,
                            defendants and 3<sup>rd</sup> party had conducted
                            themselves as partners and the terms of the partnership are evidenced in
                            the POAs, Dividend Shareholders Agreement, article 43 and the Zhong
                            Eng POA.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff conceded however that the
                    Dividend Shareholders Agreement had not been breached whilst he was shareholder
                    of the company. The plaintiff further concedes that had it been the intention of
                    the parties under the Dividend Shareholders Agreement or indeed under the POA to
                    prevent any shareholder from granting any option or any interest in his shares
                    to third parties without granting the same right to existing shareholders, or
                    without their prior disclosure or consent, they could have so provided. However,
                    they did not so provide and confined themselves to stating only that they would
                    not sell to third parties without the approval or consent of the directors and
                    respective shareholders. The plaintiff concedes that these had not been breached
                    whilst he was a shareholder of the company. Hence, no reasonable contractual
                    cause of action appears from the draft amendment to the statement of
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With respect to his second draft amendment to
                    the statement of claim, no further particulars were pleaded with respect to any
                    unequivocal conduct of the defendants or the company that would amount to
                    estoppel so as to overcome the <em>locus standi</em>
                    precondition (quite apart from the substantive requirements) under s 216 of
                    the Companies Act. In the light of this, I declined leave to amend the statement
                    of claim further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In these circumstances, I would grant the
                    application to strike out the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment
                    No 3) under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court as it discloses no
                    reasonable cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Registrar’s Appeal No 165 of 2010
                    is allowed. Costs of the Appeal and hearing below before AR fixed at $12,000,
                    inclusive of disbursements. Costs of dismissal of the action to be agreed or
                    taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Summons No 4214 of 2010 for leave to
                    amend Statement of Claim is not granted. Costs included in costs of appeal
                    awarded above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Leave is granted to withdraw notice of appeal
                    filed earlier and to file fresh notice of appeal from 11 January 2011
                    onwards.</p>
