<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. Leefon Corporation (Pte) Ltd (‘Leefon’) started the action

below to recover the sum of $15,279.98 from Stone Tec Material Supplies Pte Ltd

(‘Stone Tec’). The basis of Leefon’s claim was that they had overpaid Stone

Tec for materials supplied. Stone Tec not only denied the claim but also asserted that in

fact it had been underpaid by some $99,251.80. It made a counterclaim for this amount. In

the course of the trial, Leefon reduced its overpayment claim to $12,784.14. In the event,

the District Judge dismissed Leefon’s claim and allowed the counterclaim. Leefon now

seeks to reverse that decision.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. In 1997, Leefon was awarded a subcontract to supply stone materials

for the building project known as Sunrise Condominium. The main contractor for the project

was GTM-Wan Soon Construction Pte Ltd. In the course of looking for suppliers, Leefon came

into contact with Stone Tec, a company which supplies materials for construction work who

gave an initial quotation for the materials. In December 1997, Leefon, wanting a further

quotation from Stone Tec, forwarded to them a fresh bill of quantities (‘BQ’)

and the architect’s drawings for the project.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. On 10 February 1998, Stone Tec wrote to Leefon, by way of proforma

invoice, setting out the terms on which it was prepared to supply materials (consisting of

sandstone, limestone, compressed marble, granite rubble and other types of stone) to

Leefon for the project. Attached to this letter were 15 pages of the BQ duly filled in

with the rates at which Stone Tec was prepared to supply the various materials. On 9 March

1998, Leefon accepted Stone Tec’s offer by signing and stamping the proforma invoice

in the manner provided for in the invoice. Stone Tec also signed the proforma invoice,

apparently on 10 March 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. Among the terms set out in the proforma invoice was the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘Production takes about ten days and it subjected <i>(sic)</i> to

  factory working condition without obstruction. At least 7 days notice is required before

  we proceed cutting <i>(sic) </i>at our factory.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘Agreement will be confirmed and valid upon signed <i>(sic) </i>by

  both parties and received your purchase order or confirmation letter.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In the BQ, the dimensions, profiles and quantities of materials

required were clearly stated. In addition, the prices quoted by Stone Tec were expressed

in terms of dollars per metre run or per square metre except in respect of pilaster caps

and weirs which were quoted in a per piece basis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. According to the dates in Stone Tec’s delivery orders, they

commenced delivery of materials to the project on 24 July 1998 but the bulk of material

was supplied from 6 October 1998 onwards. The last delivery was made in February 1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. Leefon did not pay for the materials as and when the same were

supplied. Instead, they made payment at odd intervals. Stone Tec contended that these

payments were made in response to demands for settlement of outstanding invoices but

Leefon maintained that the payments were not related to invoices but most were lump sum

payments made on account to help Stone Tec with its cash flow difficulties. The payments

made were as follows:</p>

</table>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. Some time in mid December 1998, Stone Tec submitted their claim for

payment. Leefon was not satisfied with this computation and a meeting was called at the

end of December to resolve the matter. A further computation was submitted by Stone Tec in

early 1999 but this too was rejected by Leefon. Leefon asserted that the billing had been

done using rates different from that quoted in the agreed BQ in that for items for which

the prices quoted were on a per unit basis, the amount billed was based on the number of

delivered pieces and for those items in respect of which the prices quoted were on a

square metre basis, again the amount billed was based on the number of pieces delivered.

Leefon accordingly did their own computation of what was due to Stone Tec on the basis of

the prices in the BQ.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. By the beginning of 1999, Leefon had paid Stone Tec $267,236.50 but

according to Stone Tec’s invoices, this amount was way below what was due to them.

For the next few months Stone Tec kept pressing for payment and Leefon subsequently made

two further payments in April and May 1999. The dispute over the correct billing basis

continued and there were various meetings between the parties to try and resolve the

issue. They were not able to do so. By 1 December 1999, Leefon had recomputed the amount

due to Stone Tec as being $306,918.10. This was not accepted by Stone Tec. According to

the latter’s invoices, the total amount due from Leefon was $448,988.30 and since

Leefon had paid only $349,736.50 there was a balance due to them of $99,251.80.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. When the action was filed, Leefon had prepared a revised statement

of accounts whereby the total amount due to Stone Tec was computed as being $334,465.52

which meant that Leefon had overpaid them by $15,259,98. By the time the trial started,

however, Leefon had revised their computation again and they applied for and were given

leave to amend their statement of claim to show that the amount due to Stone Tec was in

fact $336,952.36. This meant that the overpayment was in the lesser amount of $12,784.14

and Leefon accordingly reduced their claim to this sum.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The pleadings</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. By the time the action was commenced, both sides knew where the

battle lines were drawn: each of them had come up with different computations of the

amounts chargeable by Stone Tec for the materials supplied. When it came to pleadings,

however, both sides were succinct in the extreme. This was a case that would have

benefited from a careful delineation of each party’s stand and the basis therefor

instead of reliance on standard form short pleadings which are better suited to a case in

which there is no substantial dispute.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. The amended statement of claim consisted of two paragraphs. The

first stated that the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants was for the sum of

$12,784.14 being the amount overpaid by the plaintiffs to the defendants for the supply of

materials for the plaintiffs’ project at Sunrise Gardens Condominium. As particulars

of the claim, the plaintiffs referred to the annexed statement of account. This statement

was a 13 page long table setting out the plaintiffs’ detailed computation of the

amounts due to the defendants for the materials delivered. This table dealt with each type

of material delivered and in respect of the same gave the following details: with

reference to the BQ, the section of the BQ, the description, the size, the unit, the rate,

the total, the list, the item, and with reference to goods actually supplied, the size,

the quantity, the unit, the rate and the total. The second paragraph stated that the

defendants had failed to reimburse the plaintiffs despite repeated demands.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. The defence and counterclaim was equally brief. The first three

paragraphs consisted of denials of the plaintiffs’ claim. The counterclaim consisted

of seven paragraphs but the substance of the claim was contained in only two paragraphs

viz paragraphs 6 and 7 which read:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘6. By a contract or contracts made between the Defendants and the

  Plaintiffs on or about or from February 1998, the Defendants provided the materials

  contracted for to the Plaintiffs for money consideration.</p>
<p align="justify">7. In breach of the said contract or contracts, the Plaintiffs have to

  date failed to pay for the Defendants’ supplies in the total outstanding sum of

  $99,251.80.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b><p align="left">PARTICULARS</p>
</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="left">The particulars are set out in the Annexure herein.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The annexure referred to contained a table of items under the following

headings: date, invoice number, amount (S$) and at the end of that, a total which was set

off against a list of payments received, credit notes and debit notes. The balance due was

shown as being $99,251.80.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. The defence to counterclaim added nothing substantial. It consisted

mainly of an assertion that the defendants had been overpaid and a denial that the

plaintiffs were indebted to the defendants in the sum of $99,251.80 as claimed or at all.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The parties’ cases as appeared from the affidavits of evidence-in-chief </p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. Leefon had two witnesses. The first was Daniel Wee Han Boon. He was

a project manager with Leefon, in charge of their Stone Division, between February 1997

and December 1998. The first few paragraphs of his affidavit dealt with initial

negotiations between Leefon and Stone Tec which had focussed on the rates quoted by Stone

Tec. Finally, the parties came to an agreement in about early February 1998 and Stone

Tec’s proforma invoice was signed thereafter. According to Mr Wee’s affidavit,

the contract consisted of the proforma invoice and the agreed BQ referred to therein and

these documents were exhibited as WHB3 to his affidavit. That exhibit comprised the

proforma invoice, the completed BQ consisting of ten pages and Stone Tec’s quotation

dated 8 October 1997 which consisted of five pages.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. Mr Wee went on to say that the contract was done on a back-to-back

basis in that Stone Tec was to co-ordinate with the main contractor in respect of the work

schedule, delivery schedule for the materials, cut lists, fabrication/templates, and

arrangement for delivery of the materials. Apart from this co-ordination, all other

queries of the main contractor from Stone Tec and vice versa were to be routed to Leefon.

The cutting lists were to be forwarded to Stone Tec by the main contractor on a

progressive basis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. In April 1998, Stone Tec informed Leefon that the full cutting

lists had not yet been received from the main contractor and that they would not be

responsible for any delay in the project as a result. In May the main contractor informed

Leefon that there were some changes to the original drawings/plans. These changes were

documented in the form of supplemental drawings and forwarded to Stone Tec. On 8 August

1998, Leefon forwarded to Stone Tec five cutting lists together with 12 drawings and four

schedules of quantities.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. Some time between August and September 1998, Herman Ang, Stone

Tec’s general manager, requested Daniel Wee to make part- payment of $103,000 to

enable Stone Tec to ship in sandstone. Mr Wee stated that he authorised this part-payment

as he was shown documents evidencing that shipping arrangements had indeed been made.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. In October 1998, the main contractor informed Leefon that the

delivery schedule for the fabricated sandstone had not been complied with. The main

contractor was also not satisfied with the quality of the sandstone so far delivered.

Attempts made by Mr Wee to contact Mr Ang to resolve these complaints were unsuccessful

and subsequently Mr Wee decided to visit Stone Tec’s fabricators in Singapore to find

out the actual status of affairs. He learnt from these visits that none of the fabrication

works were complete and he subsequently wrote to Stone Tec informing them that all

fabrication works should be completed by 21 November 1998. This deadline was not complied

with.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. On 21 November 1998, Stone Tec asked for funds to enable them to

make payment to their suppliers and fabricators. Mr Wee said that he refused to authorise

this payment was Stone Tec was not able to show that they had carried out substantial work

that would justify the payment request. However, subsequently, Leefon’s then deputy

general manager, one Mr Liew, authorised the payment and the second payment of $103,000

was made on 3 December 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. Paragraphs 20 to 23 of the affidavit dealt with some difficulties

relating to the fabrication works and the use of epoxy pieces as a temporary measure. The

main contractor wanted these pieces removed and while the parties were trying to sort out

the situation, Stone Tec submitted their payment claims to Leefon. Mr Wee told his

colleague, Mr Seah, to look into these claims. He himself left Leefon’s employ on 31

December 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. The next witness was Mr Ronnie Seah Chong Peng. He was a senior

project executive in the employ of Leefon between October 1996 and June 2000. Much of his

affidavit recited events that had already been dealt with by Mr Wee. In paragraph 21, he

started to deal with the claim for payment made by Stone Tec in December 1998. Mr Seah

said that this claim contained only the invoice numbers, the dates of the invoices and the

sub-total amount due without specifying the actual quantities supplied or the unit rate

and without making any reference to the agreed BQ. A meeting was convened on 26 December

to try to resolve the matter.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. At the meeting, Leefon was represented by Mr Wee, Mr Liew, and Mr

Seah whilst Stone Tec’s representatives were Mr Ang, Mr David Lim, their site

co-ordinator, and Ms Lucy Wang, a director of Stone Tec who was in charge of billing.

During the meeting, Stone Tec was told to submit their claims in a table format and/or in

a form of a ‘schedule of finish’ so as to facilitate comparison of the items

supplied with the items and prices quoted in the BQ. Mr Seah asked Stone Tec to forward

their computation in a table which would indicate the materials supplied and the total

cost of these materials based on the unit and unit rates contained in the BQ.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. In early 1999, Stone Tec submitted their computation. Mr Seah

rejected this computation because the billing was done using rates which were different

from those quoted in the agreed BQ in that for items which the prices quoted were per

unit, the amount billed was based on the number of delivered pieces and that for items for

which prices quoted were in square metres, the amount billed for the quantity similar was

again based on the number of pieces delivered. Stone Tec did not furnish any conversion

formula to enable Mr Seah to verify their computation. Stone Tec was therefore told to

resubmit their computation based on unit and unit rate as denoted in the agreed BQ.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. Instead of resubmitting the computation, between March and July

1999, Stone Tec sent numerous reminders to Leefon asking for the outstanding amount to be

paid. On 7 July 1999, Leefon wrote to Stone Tec stating its reason for non-payment. This

was that there was a discrepancy between the prices quoted in the BQ and accepted by

Leefon and the prices actually charged. Leefon also said that up to then they had paid

Stone Tec $280,000 as against its claim on the invoices totalling $380,000. Such payment

had been made out of goodwill. The full payment according to the invoices could not be

made because of discrepancies.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. In early August 1999, Leefon suggested that a site meeting be held

to confirm the actual quantities of materials supplied and/or any additional works done.

The site meeting was held on 10 August 1999 and attended by Mr David Lim and Mr Seah.

During that meeting, no verification took place but Mr Lim agreed that all materials

supplied were in accordance with the agreed BQ and the additional and variation works were

as previously agreed between the parties.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. Around the end of August there was another meeting to try and

resolve the problem. Again Stone Tec was asked to submit a summarised bill in a table

format to facilitate comparison with the rates in the BQ. Stone Tec forwarded their

further computation on 15 September. Mr Seah compared this with the construction drawings,

cut lists and actual supply to site as reflected in the delivery orders. He did not agree

with the computation as he found that the items listed were not according to those in the

BQ. Further, there were a lot of items that were not listed in the BQ. He therefore

recomputed the figures and forwarded his computation to Stone Tec on 16 November 1999 for

their verification. Subsequently, the parties met on 23 November 1999 and Stone Tec put

forward their objections to Leefon’s computation. Subsequently, Mr Seah recomputed

the figures based on a detailed study of the quotation and agreed BQ, the cut lists and

site measurements. The re-computation was forwarded to Stone Tec but they did not accept

it. Thereafter, the parties were not able to reach any agreement. It is important to note

that although certain portions of Mr Seah’s affidavit were expunged on Stone

Tec’s objections, as they dealt with without prejudice negotiations between the

parties, those parts of his affidavit I have paraphrased above were not affected by these

criticisms. Yet, Stone Tec did not cross-examine him at all on any of the allegations

which remained in his affidavit.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. There were three witnesses for Stone Tec. The first was Herman Ang

Soon Leang. Mr Ang identified himself as a director of Stone Tec and confirmed that on or

about 9 March 1998, he, on behalf of Stone Tec and Daniel Wee, on behalf of Leefon, had

signed an agreement whereby Stone Tec was to provide materials to Leefon for the Sunrise

Condominium. He identified the agreement as being exhibit ASL2 to his affidavit. This

exhibit contained the proforma invoice, the five page quotation of October 1997 and the

ten page BQ. He went on to say that Leefon required a substantial portion of the materials

to be custom-made and cut to measure. He told Mr Seah and Mr Wee that since the slabs had

to be cut to measure, exact site measurements would have to be given to him and also

incorporated in the form of a complete cutting list. However, the cutting list was not

supplied to Stone Tec and therefore for those materials that required cutting, Stone Tec

had no choice but to order un-cut slab materials from India and wait for Leefon to supply

cutting lists with the exact measurements required. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. Finally, the first part of the cutting list was given to Stone Tec

who proceeded with the cutting works almost immediately. Mr Ang recalled that cutting

works commenced on or about 2 October 1998 and were completed on or about 5 December 1998.

Mr Ang told Mr Seah about his concern that Leefon’s instructions were also given at

short notice and that the cutting lists were not complete but given to him in parts. Mr

Seah told Mr Ang to go ahead and rush his subcontractors with the cutting works and

supplies. He would ensure that Stone Tec was paid. Stone Tec delivered the materials as

agreed and raised invoices to Leefon for the materials supplied. These invoices were not

paid in full. Yet, Stone Tec continued to perform their end of the agreement to

completion.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. Mr Ang went on to say that Stone Tec had sent various reminders to

Leefon for payment. Rather amazingly, Leefon then commenced this action against Stone Tec

for a sum allegedly overpaid to Stone Tec. In sheer exasperation Stone Tec retained

solicitors to defend the claim and commence a counterclaim.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. The next witness was Ms Lucy Wang Siam Keng. She was also a

director of Stone Tec. Her affidavit contained nothing that was different from the

contents of Mr Ang’s affidavit. In fact, most of her affidavit was hearsay based on

what she understood Mr Ang had told Mr Seah and Mr Seah had told Mr Ang. She too was

‘amazed’ that Leefon had sued Stone Tec and confirmed that Stone Tec had acted

‘in sheer exasperation’ in defending the claim and mounting the counterclaim.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. The last witness was David Lim Boon Ann who was the sales and

project co-ordinator of Stone Tec. His affidavit was identical to that of Ms Wang.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The decision below</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. The District Judge first summarised the case of each party. She

then noted that what had to be determined were first the nature of the contract between

the parties and secondly, whether Stone Tec was entitled to apply rates that differed from

those in the BQ to the materials supplied. The judge did not go on to note the third

matter to be determined, perhaps because of the decision she had reached on the first two.

The third issue was whether, on the basis that Stone Tec’s rates were not

contractually agreed, Leefon’s calculations based on the BQ were correct.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33. After summarising the evidence presented by each party, the judge

discussed her findings. The judge noted that Leefon had not referred to the contract

between the parties in their pleadings. They had merely made their claim for overpayment

without stating its basis. However, it was not disputed in evidence that the contract for

the supply of materials was AB3 to AB14 [note: these pages comprised the proforma invoice

and the BQ but excluded the October 1997 quotation]. She examined the computation made by

Leefon of the materials supplied and observed that Leefon could not show in this

computation that the materials supplied corresponded with the descriptions in the BQ.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34. The judge went on to find that the contract was a contract for the

supply of materials. She also observed that ‘it may be’ that the parties had

agreed that the cutting lists from the main contractors be taken as the purchase orders.

She also noted that the delivery terms of the contract provided for production to take ten

days and seven days’ notice to be given before cutting was to be proceeded with so

that all in all 17 days’ notice was required for delivery. In fact, no such notice

was given and the materials were all delivered within a few days of supply of the cutting

lists.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35. The judge stated that it was not disputed that the materials that

were ultimately supplied by Stone Tec were vastly different from the descriptions in the

BQ. It was also not disputed that where the items were the same as those in the BQ, the

rates in the BQ were used. She continued at 20 of her grounds:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘20. An examination of the description of the items in the

  delivery orders and invoices, which are in accordance with the cutting lists, would show

  that they do not correspond with the descriptions in the BQ at all. A comparison of the

  descriptions in the BQ and the delivery orders would show substantial differences, for

  which it would not be possible to extrapolate the agreed rates in the BQ to apply to the

  materials delivered by the defendants. As such, they must be taken to be variation orders

  or additional orders. The issue therefore, arose as to whether the terms of the variation

  orders or additional orders have been agreed by the plaintiffs. Mr Ang has alleged that Mr

  Wee and Mr Seah had undertaken to pay the defendants pursuant to the variation but he had

  not informed them of the rates for the variation orders. However, the defendants had

  issued invoices to the plaintiffs on the same date as the delivery orders for the

  materials delivered. There was no evidence that the plaintiffs had disputed any of these

  invoices until sometime in December 1998, according to Mr Wee’s evidence. Mr Wee

  claimed upon clarification by the court, that he did not receive the invoices. However, he

  admitted that he was aware that the invoices were sent and he claimed that he had

  highlighted to Mr Ang verbally that the defendants should make progress claims.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36. The judge went on to state that since the contract was for the

supply of materials, it was not necessary for Stone Tec to make progress claims rather

than to issue invoices. Leefon had paid Stone Tec’s first two invoices on 1 August

1998 and had not raised any issue that a progress claim should have been made by Stone

Tec. The bulk of the invoices for the sandstone supplied were dated from 6 October 1998 to

31 December 1998. She then referred to Stone Tec’s submission that Leefon’s

agreement to Stone Tec’s rates for the variations orders and the additional orders

could be inferred from their conduct in accepting and using the materials supplied. The

judge concluded in 23:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘The plaintiffs did not reject or return any of the materials or

  raise an issue over the invoices initially. In fact, upon receipt of the invoices, various

  payments were made by them on 21 October 1998, 3 December 1998, 5 April 1999 and 7 May

  1999. While the last two payments were made after the dispute had arisen, the first two

  were not. Although the 30 day payment period may not have expired on 21 October 1998 or 3

  December 1998, Mr Wee admitted under cross-examination that part of the materials been

  delivered when the payments were made and in respect of the payment made on 3 December

  1998, the defendants had probably delivered materials up to the value of the payments that

  were made. In any event, the delivery orders together with the invoices would have been

  submitted by the defendants. Mr Wee claimed that he did not look at the invoices as the

  contract was a progressive one. But the terms of the contract at AB3 as regards payment

  are clear. There is no requirement for a progressive claim to be made. In the words of

  Steyn LJ in <i>Trentham Ltd v Archital Luxfer </i>[1993] Lloyd’s Law Reports, 25, at

  page 29:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In a case where the transaction was fully performed the argument

    that there was no evidence upon which the Judge could find that a contract was proved is

    implausible. A contract can be concluded by conduct …"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the circumstances, I agree with the defendants’ counsel’s

  submission that there was a contract for the supply of the materials at the rates stated

  in the invoices, by the conduct of the plaintiffs in accepting delivery and using the

  materials upon receipt of the invoices. The plaintiffs continued to do so until all the

  materials required for the project have been supplied and delivered by the

  defendants.’ </p>

Analysis</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37. From the above, it can be seen that the judge’s decision was

based on the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) her finding that many of the items in the Stone Tec invoices did

  not correspond at all with the descriptions in the BQ and her inference from that finding

  that it would not be possible to extrapolate the agreed rates in the BQ to apply to the

  materials delivered;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) her conclusion that those materials which did not comply with the

  description in the BQ had to be considered as additional or variation orders;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) her redefining of the issue as being whether the terms of the

  variation or additional orders had been agreed by Leefon and her finding that Leefon did

  not reject or return any of the materials or raise any of issues initially but had instead

  made two payments in October and December 1998 ‘upon receipt of the invoices’;

  and</p>
<p align="justify">(4) her conclusion that there was a contract for the supply of

  materials at the rate stated in the invoices arising from Leefon’s conduct in

  accepting the delivery and using materials upon receipt of the invoices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38. With due respect to the judge, I cannot accept her reasoning.

First, there is no evidence to substantiate her conclusion that because the items in the

invoices were described differently from the items in the BQ no extrapolation could be

made from the BQ rates to establish the cost of the items delivered. Mr Seah’s

testimony was that he had been able to do exactly that by a detailed study of the

quotation and the BQ, the cutting lists and the site measurements. He also took into

account the actual items supplied to the site as reflected in the delivery orders. Such a

calculation is not impossible since the items delivered were used in accordance with the

drawings and the BQ had been drawn up on that basis as well. It was not as if the items

were to be used in some way that was totally different than the use originally envisaged.

It would be recalled that Mr Seah had averred that at a meeting at the site in August

1999, Mr Lim had agreed that all materials supplied were in accordance with the BQ. Mr

Seah was not cross-examined on this allegation or on any of the computations that he had

made in relation to the correct costing for the items delivered. It was not put to him

that overall what he had done was an impossibility nor were any specific areas in any of

his computations criticised. At the least, this lack of cross-examination showed that

Stone Tec had no basis on which to quarrel with those computations. At the most it could

be considered an admission of the truth of Mr Seah’s evidence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39. Secondly, there was little basis for the conclusion that the

materials that did not comply with the description of items in the B Q had to be

considered as additional or variation orders by that reason alone. This conclusion was

based on the physical differences in the description only. It was not based on any

pleading on the part of Stone Tec. Nor was it based on any case made out in the affidavits

of evidence-in-chief of Stone Tec’s witnesses. Mr Ang had agreed in 4 of his

affidavit that the contract between the parties was the one signed by Mr Wee and himself

in March 1998. He said nothing in any of the paragraphs following that about there being

additional or variation orders. His concern in the subsequent paragraphs was to explain

the difficulties that Stone Tec had encountered because of alleged delays in the delivery

of the cutting lists and the fact that he had had to order uncut slabs of sandstone from

India and arrange for cutting in Singapore. Since it was not pleaded that there had been

additional or variation orders to which different rates would apply from those agreed to

in the BQ, it was not open to Stone Tec’s counsel to make submissions on that basis.

Nor was it open to the judge to make a finding on the issue.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40. It was Stone Tec who contended that the rates in their invoices

(which they agreed were not the BQ rates) were the applicable rates. This was the basis of

Stone Tec’s counterclaim. They should have pleaded their case on that basis. Instead,

their counterclaim simply referred to a contract or contracts made from February 1998

without specifying that such contract was any different from that relied on by Leefon. Nor

did they give any particulars of how such contract was formed ie by oral agreement or by

conduct. This deficiency in the pleading was compounded by the affidavits of

evidence-in-chief. There was nothing there to tell either Leefon or the court that Stone

Tec was proceeding on contracts that were different from or additional to the one sued on

by Leefon and accepted by the judge as <u>the</u> contract between the parties. Stone Tec

had the onus of making their counterclaim clear. They could only propound a case that was

pleaded. Having failed to meet this basic legal obligation, there was no ground for them

to put forward arguments on variation of the contract or on additional contracts whether

or not there was evidence to support their assertion that Mr Wee had agreed to pay them

extra. In fact such evidence was irrelevant in the context of their pleaded case which

contained no reference to any new contract or any contract which had been varied for good

consideration.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41. Since there was a contract in existence, there was no room for any

argument or conclusion that the acceptance and use of materials delivered by Stone Tec

resulted in contracts for the purchase of those materials at the rates stated in the

invoices issued. The cases quoted by counsel for Stone Tec both in the court below and

before me related to the very different situation where, in the absence of any existing

written or oral contract, conduct was used to show that the parties had come to an

agreement. The situation here was the opposite: a contract existed and the conduct was in

accordance with the existing contract. Leefon had asked Stone Tec to supply materials on a

certain basis. When the materials came, Leefon accepted them and used them as it was all

along envisaged they would be accepted and used. Acceptance and use of the materials in

these circumstances cannot be used to justify a conclusion that Leefon had agreed to the

new rates quoted in the invoices.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42. Further, the invoices sent reflected charges on a per piece basis.

Until these charges were examined carefully in the context of the amount of material

supplied, it could not be ascertained whether the rates charged were as per the BQ or

otherwise. In the situation that existed, Leefon’s acceptance and use of the

materials was not capable of giving rise to only one inference ie that they had agreed to

pay whatever Stone Tec had chosen to charge and that they were no longer relying on the

agreed contractual rates. It should be noted that the rates in the BQ were those quoted by

Stone Tec and accepted by Leefon and for that reason it may not have occurred to Leefon

that the rates in the invoices would have differed from those in the BQ. Further, as was

pointed out below, the original intention had been for the items to be cut locally rather

than in India as indicated by the condition in the proforma invoice relating to the seven

day notice requirement before Stone Tec would proceed with ‘cutting at our

factory’. Thus, an increase in rates by reason of local cutting would not have been a

factor in Leefon’s consideration when they accepted the materials. It should be noted

that it was not put to Mr Wee during cross-examination that Mr Ang had informed him that

local cutting would result in increased costs and that he had urged Stone Tec to go ahead

nevertheless.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43. None of the four payments made by Leefon before the dispute over

billing arose was made in such circumstances as to give rise to an unequivocal inference

that Leefon had accepted the new rates. The non BQ rates were applied mainly to the

sandstone which was delivered from October 6 onwards. Before that Leefon had paid Stone

Tec $61,336.50 which was the amount outstanding under two invoices dated 24 July 1998

issued for granite rubble stone and broken Solnhofen. Most of these materials were charged

at unit prices based on the area in terms of square metre of materials delivered, though

one component was charged on a per piece basis. According to Mr Ang, the materials billed

for here were straight forward materials, not sandstone, and therefore did not require any

cutting. The billing for these materials was in accordance with the BQ and the different

components were charged according to the ‘metre square’ rate or the piece rate.

Since these invoices were in accordance with the BQ rates, Leefon’s payment of them

could not give rise to any inference of accepting a varied rate or varied price basis. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44. The next two payments made by Leefon were in the sum of $103,000

each. Leefon’s explanation was that these were lump sum payments made to help Stone

Tec to pay their fabricators and stone cutters. These payments did not represent

acceptance of outstanding invoices although, in court, Mr Wee accepted that by the time

the first of these payments was made, ie on 21 November 1998, Stone Tec had probably

supplied materials which exceeded $103,000 in value. In rejecting Leefon’s

explanation of these payments, the judge overlooked the fact that the amounts of the

payments were round sums and did not reflect individual invoices issued in respect of

deliveries made. Nor did she have regard to the letter that Stone Tec wrote to Leefon on

21 November 1998 asking for $100,000 to enable Stone Tec to pay their suppliers and

fabricators. No mention was made in that letter of payment of specific invoices for

materials already supplied nor was there any reference to any change in the costing due to

the cutting lists and/or the necessity to fabricate locally instead of in India.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45. The character of these two payments was also reflected by the fact

that Stone Tec, as shown by the appendix to their counterclaim, had issued specific

invoices for these two amounts and subsequently, in drawing up their accounts, deducted

the amounts of these two invoices from their claims. Otherwise there would have been a

duplication and an overcharge since the two invoices for $103,000 each did not reflect any

specific delivery of materials.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46. In order to establish their counterclaim, Stone Tec had also to

show how their invoices were computed. They, however, failed to show exactly how this was

done. There was no explanation of how they arrived at the prices charged. Mr Ang was

unable to explain to the court how the balance sum of $99,251.80 which Stone Tec claimed

to be due had been derived. His only explanation was that the invoices had been done by Ms

Wang. During cross-examination of Ms Wang she was taken through some of the invoices and

asked on what basis they had been prepared. Her reply was that the invoices were based on

the cutting lists and they tallied with the BQ except when the sizes of materials supplied

had differed. When asked to cross refer to the BQ and quotation and point out the

corresponding item numbers in the BQ, she was unable to do so. Further, when she was asked

for the computation of the amount outstanding, Mr Wang’s reply was that she had

‘forgotten to put it in’. As early as 4 December 1999 in response to a letter

from Leefon asking for the basis of Stone Tec’s claim, Stone Tec had stated that they

were trying to extract all necessary documents to show Leefon how their claim was

calculated. Unfortunately, by the time the matter came to court, this was still not done.

Whilst Stone Tec was able to give a mathematical calculation of their claim by adding the

amounts of all the invoices together and subtracting the payments received from the total

(as they had done as early as 23 November 1999), they were not able to justify their bills

by reference to agreed rates or their own costs or even by what would be reasonable costs

in the market for the items supplied.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b><br/>

Conclusion</b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47. Whilst I have pointed out the deficiencies in Stone Tec’s

evidence, the basic problem with their counterclaim was that it was not properly pleaded.

As every litigation lawyer should know, what you do not plead you cannot prove and thus

cannot successfully claim. Stone Tec failed to establish any legal basis which would have

entitled them to charge Leefon for the materials in the way that they did. It was common

ground that the substantial portion of Stone Tec’s claim was not calculated in

accordance with the BQ which contained the contractually agreed rates. Stone Tec having

failed to show the legal basis of their claim, the counterclaim failed and should have

been dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48. As regards Leefon’s claim, they pleaded that they had overpaid

Stone Tec based on their computation of what was due to Stone Tec under the contract. The

contract was admitted by Stone Tec. Stone Tec denied that they had been overpaid but they

did not challenge Mr Seah’s evidence on how the computation had been arrived at based

on the BQ rates, taken together with the drawings, the cutting lists and the amounts

delivered. This was a grievous mistake on their part. Since they did not challenge that

evidence, they must be held to have accepted it as the correct calculation of the amount

due on the basis that the correct rates to apply were those contained in the BQ.

Accordingly, Leefon had proved their claim and it should have been allowed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49. In the premises, I allow Leefon’s appeal and set aside the

judgment below. There shall be judgment for Leefon in the sum of $12,784.14 together with

interest at 6% per annum from the date of the judgment below. Stone Tec’s

counterclaim is dismissed. Leefon shall have the costs of the action and of this appeal.</p>
