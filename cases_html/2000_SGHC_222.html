<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><em><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Cur Ad Vult</strong></font></em></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1.    In this case, the

plaintiffs alleged that the defendant, their former managing director, breached his

fiduciary duties to them by misusing company funds for unauthorised purposes, an

allegation denied by the defendant. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2.    The plaintiffs

initially sought a number of remedies in relation to the alleged misuse of company funds.

However, during the course of the trial, they and the defendant agreed to appoint an

accountant to determine the veracity of all but one of the allegations of misuse of funds.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3.    The only allegation

of misuse of funds outside the ambit of the task entrusted to the accountant concerned the

propriety of a payment by the plaintiffs of $100,000 to the defendant’s sister, Ong

Siew Ann. The plaintiffs contended that this payment of $100,000 was improper because it

was made with respect to the purchase by the defendant of Siew Ann’s shares in the

plaintiff company. It was not disputed that Siew Ann did not have any shares in the

plaintiff company in her own name. However, it was alleged that the defendant, in

accordance with his late father’s wishes, held 10% of the shares in the plaintiff

company on trust for Siew Ann. This allegation was strenuously denied by the defendant.

Both the plaintiffs and the defendant agreed that the only issue which they required the

court to determine was whether or not the defendant held 10% of the shares in the

plaintiff company on trust for Siew Ann. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="center" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">A. <b>BACKGROUND</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4.    The plaintiffs are

part of the Tong Garden group of companies in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and China. The

group is well known in the snack food and nuts industry and its roots lie in a business

started by the defendant’s father, the late Ong Tong Guan. The plaintiffs’

present shareholders are all children of the late Ong Tong Guan. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5.    The late Ong Tong

Guan had 10 children from his marriage to the defendant’s mother. They are as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Ong Siew Hua, the eldest child </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Ong Leong Chuan, the defendant and the

  eldest son </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Ong Boon Chuan, the second son</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Ong Heng Chuan, the third son</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) Ong Siew Kuan, the second daughter</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(f) Ong Teck Chuan, the fourth son</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(g) Ong Siew Chin, the third daughter</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(h) Ong Siew Ann, the fourth daughter</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Ong Eng Chuan, the fifth son</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(j) Ong Siew Lay, the fifth daughter and

  youngest child.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Apparently, the late Ong Tong Guan had

another wife and a number of children in China but that is irrelevant for the purpose of

this action. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6.    Ong Tong Guan gave

oral instructions regarding the distribution of his assets shortly before he died. The

defendant, his mother and his brother, Ong Boon Chuan, were present when he gave those

instructions. As far as the distribution of shares in the plaintiff company was concerned,

the new shareholding arrangement was, on the instructions of the defendant, recorded in

the minutes of a company meeting purportedly held on 3 July 1984 but it was common ground

that no such meeting took place on that day. A few days before Ong Tong Guan died, he made

a will, the effect of which was to bequeath the remainder of his estate to the plaintiffs.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7.    The root of the

problems facing the children of the late Ong Tong Guan may be traced to the fact that they

cannot agree on what were their father’s final instructions regarding the

distribution of the shares in the plaintiff company. As has been mentioned, only the

defendant, his brother, Boon Chuan, and their late mother were present when Ong Tong Guan

distributed the shares. According to the defendant, the shares were distributed by his

late father in the following manner:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) 30% to him</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) 20% to his brother, Ong Heng Chuan</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) 20% to his brother, Ong Teng Chuan </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) 10% to his late mother </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) 10% to his sister, Ong Siew Kuan</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(f) 10% to his sister, Ong Siew Chin.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8.    If the defendant is

right, this would mean that five of his siblings, namely two of his brothers, Boon Chuan

and Eng Chuan, and three of his sisters, Siew Hua, Siew Lay and Siew Ann, did not get any

shares in the plaintiff company. However, Boon Chuan, Eng Chuan and Siew Lay received

other gifts from their father. It follows that apart from Ong Siew Hua, who received

neither shares nor any other property from their father because she married someone whose

business competed with that of the plaintiffs, Siew Ann is the only other sibling who

inherited nothing from her father. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.    The defendant’s

brother, Boon Chuan, disagreed that the defendant was given 30% of the shares in the

plaintiff company or that their father left nothing to Siew Ann. In paras 5, 6 and 7 of

his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he explained:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Sometime before my father passed away, he

  called a meeting between the defendant, my mother and myself. My sister, Ong Siew Kuan,

  was supposed to attend but did not do so as she was ill on that day.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">At the meeting, my father told us that he

  wanted to give his sons a 20% share each in the Plaintiffs while his daughters would get a

  10% share each. However, since I was involved in a related family business, I was to get

  shares in that company instead of the Plaintiffs. Another brother, Ong Eng Chuan was to

  receive shares in another company instead of the Plaintiffs as well.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10.    Boon Chuan said that

in accordance with his father’s instructions, three of his brothers, namely the

defendant, Heng Chuan and Teng Chuan, each got 20% of the shares in the plaintiff company

while the remaining 40% was split equally between his four sisters, Siew Kuan, Siew Chin,

Siew Ann and Siew Lay, with each getting 10%. He added that Siew Lay’s 10% was to be

held on trust for her by their mother while Siew Ann’s 10% was to be held on trust

for her by the defendant. This explains why 30% of the shares in the plaintiff company

were registered in the defendant’s name.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11.    The stage was thus

set for disputes between the defendant and his siblings, which ranged from Siew Ann’s

shares to the way in which the defendant ran the company. In 1999, the defendant was

removed from the position of managing director of the plaintiffs by his siblings.

Subsequently, the plaintiff company instituted this action against the defendant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="center" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">B. WHETHER THE DEFENDANT HOLDS SHARES ON

TRUST FOR ONG SIEW ANN </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12.    Whether or not the

defendant holds 10% of the shares in the plaintiff company on trust for Siew Ann is

crucial to the plaintiffs’ case because the plaintiffs alleged that their funds had

been used to fund the defendant’s purchase of the said 10% from Siew Ann. The

plaintiffs submitted that if the circumstances surrounding the payment of the $100,000 are

closely examined, evidence showing the existence of such a trust will be found. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13.    The defendant, who

strenuously denied that he held 10% of the shares in the plaintiff company on trust for

Siew Ann, initially took the position that the distribution of shares was in accordance

with his late father’s wishes. However, during cross-examination, he took a different

stand and claimed to have had "the final say" in these matters. The relevant

portion of his evidence is as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. If Ong Siew Lay was working for the

  company, there is nothing to distinguish between Ong Siew Chin and Ong Siew Lay and no

  reason not to give her shares.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. She contributed so little. I had the

  final say.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. You never mentioned in your affidavit

  that you had the final say.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. The affidavit was not very clear about

  this.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. In para 55 of your affidavit for

  another action, OS No 1944 of 1999, you said that your father adopted your suggestions.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. That is not correct.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.    Apart from

contradicting his original stand as to whether it was he or his late father who decided on

the distribution of shares in the plaintiff company, the defendant also took a different

position from that stated by him in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief in OS No 1944 of

1999 with respect to what else had been decided by his late father regarding the

distribution of his other property.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15.    After reiterating

that no shares were held on trust for Siew Ann, the defendant next asserted that his

siblings raised the question of a trust only recently in order to reduce his percentage of

shares in the plaintiff company. Contrary to what the defendant asserted, it does not

appear that the question of Siew Ann’s shares arose recently. To begin with, Siew Ann

contended that before her father died, the defendant told her that she had 10% of the

shares in the plaintiff company. In paras 52 and 53 of her affidavit of evidence-in-chief,

she stated as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">52. …. In fact, it was the defendant

  himself who told me that I was to get a 10% share in the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">53. I remember that shortly before my

  father passed away, he was very ill. My mother wanted to perform some prayers for my

  father and the defendant, together with his wife and I went to purchase some items for

  prayers. While the three of us were in the defendant’s car, he told me that I was

  lucky as my father had given me a 10% share in the plaintiffs. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16.    During

cross-examination, Siew Ann reiterated that the defendant told her that he held 10% of the

shares in the plaintiff company on trust for her. Her answer was as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Only the defendant and Ong Siew Kuan

  told you that you had 10% shares in Tong Guan?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Depends on which time. I heard from

  [the defendant] first and then Siew Kuan told me, and later on, other members of the

  family told me.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.    Siew Ann also made

it clear that when the defendant arranged for her to be paid $100,000 from the

company’s funds, they both had no doubt that the payment was in respect of the 50,000

shares held on trust for her. This will be dealt with in greater detail later on when the

purpose of this payment is discussed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18.    The defendant’s

sister, Siew Kuan, who claimed to have been instructed by her late father to ensure that

Siew Ann received the 10% of the company shares held on trust for her, also disagreed that

the question of the trust shares is a recent issue. She said that shortly before her

father died, he changed his mind about having the shares held on trust for Siew Ann and

wanted the defendant to transfer the 10% to Siew Ann immediately. In paras 6 and 7 of her

affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6. Sometime in 1984, a few days before my

  father passed away, the then company secretary, Mr Seet Swee Leng, came to our house with

  some transfer forms for OSA’s 10% share to be transferred to her.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">7. The defendant objected strenuously to

  the transfer being carried out there and then and yelled at my father. My father, who was

  then very ill, did not or was not able to resist. Seet Swee Leng therefore left our house

  without having the transfer documents executed.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19.    The defendant’s

brother, Boon Chuan, also testified that the defendant quarrelled with their father over

Siew Ann’s shares. During cross-examination, he confirmed what Siew Kuan said about

the quarrel when he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. See para 5 of Ong Siew Kuan’s

  affidavit. Have you seen the document?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. No, but I know about the incident. My

  father asked [the company secretary] to come along for transferring 10% of the shares to

  Siew Ann. I heard the shouting. [The defendant] shouted at my father. He said that the

  meeting agreed that he hold Siew Ann’s shares on trust for her. Why change now? Then

  the [company secretary] left because of the argument…. My father was very sick. He

  just waved his hand, asked [the defendant] to go out and the matter was left aside.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.    Siew Kuan referred

to numerous quarrels which she had with the defendant over the trust shares. In paragraph

10 of her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">[F]or more than 2 years after my

  father’s death in 1984, the defendant failed to transfer the shares to OSA. I

  constantly reminded the defendant to do so and there were some rows between the defendant

  and I over this issue.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21.    Siew Kuan stood her

ground during cross-examination. Her answers were as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Have you tried to ask the company

  secretary to prepare documents for Leong Chuan to sign?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. No. I asked Leong Chuan when he is

  transferring the shares to Siew Ann. My father asked me to make sure that Leong Chuan

  transferred the shares to Siew Ann. So when Siew Ann came to work, I asked him about

  it….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Why did you not gather the family

  including your mother to tell Leong Chuan to transfer the shares to Siew Ann?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. I told my brother who scolded me and

  that is why he came up with the option.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22.    That there was a

measure of discord in the family over, inter alia, the defendant’s refusal to

transfer the 50,000 shares was confirmed by Siew Ann, who declared that she was upset by

the constant bickering over her shares. During cross-examination, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Since 1984 until today, Ong Boon Chuan

  never told you about the 10% shares?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. He mentioned it recently when everybody

  brought up the matter….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. This year?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. In 1986.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. In 1986, in what circumstances did Ong

  Boon Chuan tell you you had 10% shares in the company.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. There was a fight in the family.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23.    Siew Ann also said

that she was prepared to part with her shares to the defendant to bring a measure of peace

to the family. When questioned by the defendant’s counsel as to why, if indeed she

had shares, she did not sell her shares to her other siblings, she replied as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">At that point of time, I know that [the

  defendant] was very greedy. If I can give him 10% to stop the quarrelling, I am very

  happy.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24.    The defendant denied

that he told Siew Ann that he held shares on trust for her. He also denied that there was

any attempt to have him transfer shares to Siew Ann while his father was alive or that he

had been asked on several occasions to hand over the shares after his father’s death.

His evidence, when cross-examined, is as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. When your father changed his mind and

  wanted you to transfer the 10%, you shouted at him and demanded that he stick to the

  original agreement that you hold the shares on trust.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. No such thing.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Ong Siew Kuan and your mother demanded

  several times after your father’s death that you transfer the shares to Siew Ann.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. No such thing.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25.    The defendant also

alleged that it was not true that his late mother held 10% of the shares in the plaintiff

company on trust for another of his sisters, Siew Lay. He said that his siblings lied

about the existence of this trust in favour of Siew Lay in order to reinforce their claim

that he held 10% of the shares in the plaintiff company in favour of Siew Ann. He also

pointed out that after the shares in his mother’s name were sold for $2 million to

his brother, Boon Chuan, the money was returned to Boon Chuan. He thus submitted that the

sale of shares to Boon Chuan was a sham transaction. It was pointed out that in his

affidavit of evidence-in-chief in another action, OS No 1944 of 1999, Boon Chuan had said

that his late mother wanted to sell the shares to distribute the proceeds to "some of

the children". However, this does not give the complete picture. In para 25 of the

affidavit in question, Boon Chuan made it clear that his mother held the shares on trust

for Siew Lay. If his mother had actually distributed the proceeds of the sale of the

shares, Siew Lay’s rights would have been infringed. Boon Chuan and his other

siblings were not asked to clarify the position during cross-examination. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26.    Siew Lay testified

that she was aware that her late mother held 10% of the shares in the plaintiff company on

trust for her. When cross-examined, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. When did you first know that you had

  10% of the shares in Tong Guan?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. When my father was ill.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Who told you?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. My father, my mother, my sister, Ong

  Siew Kuan.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Your father told you directly or

  through Siew Kuan?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. My father told me personally.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27.    Siew Lay also

testified that after her shares had been sold to her brother, Boon Chuan, she invested the

proceeds of the sale in Boon Chuan’s business. When cross-examined as to who made the

decision to sell and to invest the money, she said:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28.    I accept that Siew

Lay’s late mother held 10% of the shares in the plaintiff company on trust for her.

In any case, it was not disputed that Siew Lay was given part of the money in her

father’s Central Provident Fund account. As such, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed

out that whether or not Siew Lay was given shares in the plaintiff company, Siew Ann

remains the only sibling excluded from the distribution of their late father’s assets

with the exception of Siew Hua, who, as has been mentioned, was deliberately excluded

because her husband’s business competed with that of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29.    It is regretted that

neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant were able to contact the company secretary, Seet

Swee Leng, who could have shed some light on what happened more than one and a half

decades ago. All the same, after having had the opportunity to assess the witnesses and

their relevant testimony, I accept that on the basis of the evidence discussed thus far,

the inescapable conclusion is that the defendant holds 10% of the shares in the plaintiff

company on trust for Siew Ann. The plaintiffs’ case is further strengthened by the

evidence discussed below.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i><u> </u></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Why was Ong Siew Ann paid $100,000?<u>
</u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30.    The circumstances

under which Siew Ann was paid $100,000 by the plaintiff company throw some light on

whether or not the defendant had been instructed by his father to hold 10% of the shares

in the plaintiff company on trust for Siew Ann. The relevant facts are as follows. In

1986, the defendant offered Siew Ann, who was then working for the plaintiffs for $1,000

per month, two options, both of which were recorded in a memorandum. The terms of the said

memorandum are as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">I, Ong Siew Ann, agree that:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) To have 50,000 shares in Tong Guan Food Products Pte

  Ltd with the following conditions:-</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">a) to work in the abovenamed Company for eight years, that

    is from Year 1983 to 1990.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">b) to be honest to the Company.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">On the condition that I receive 50,000 shares of $1.00

  each fully paid from the company by August 1986.</font></p>
<u><p><font face="Times New Roman">OR</font></p>
</u><p><font face="Times New Roman">2) To have $100,000 Cash only from Mr Ong Tong Guan

  Estate and with the following conditions:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">a) to work in Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd for at least

    five years that is from Year 1983 to 1987.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">b)    to be honest to the company.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31.    As it turned out,

Siew Ann preferred the second option and the $100,000 was paid to her out of her late

father’s estate account. It was not disputed that the money in this account belonged

to the plaintiffs as the late Ong Tong Guan had willed his estate to the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32.    The defendant’s

evidence regarding the memorandum and the options offered to Siew Ann is rather

unsatisfactory. Initially, the defendant distanced himself from the terms of the

memorandum and tried to give the impression in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the

terms in question were drafted by Siew Ann. However, the following answers of the

defendant during cross-examination showed that he decided the terms of the memorandum:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Did you have any input in the drafting?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. I cannot remember.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. The 50,000 shares. Who decided on the

  figure?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. I did.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. The condition on working for 8 years.

  Whose idea was it?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Mine.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. The last line. Was it your idea?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. It was mine.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. The $100,000 case. Whose idea was it?</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Who gave the instructions for the

  memorandum?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. I did.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33.    The defendant also

gave the impression that it was Siew Ann who caused the $100,000 due to her to be paid out

of their late father’s estate. In paras 43 and 45 of his affidavit of

evidence-in-chief, he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">43. <i>It also appears</i> that she had

  debited my father’s account with the Plaintiffs…. I believe the entries were

  made to allow her to save on income tax. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">45. …. <i>The money was not meant to

  come from my father’s estate. </i>As explained above, it was OSA who prepared the

  accounting entries and she <i>probably</i> caused the payment to be made from my

  father’s estate ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(emphasis added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34.    Contrary to what the

defendant had stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the following answers given by

him during cross-examination made it crystal clear that he knew from the very start that

the $100,000 received by Siew Ann came from their late father’s estate:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. The payment from Ong Tong Guan Estate.

  Whose idea was it?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Not sure whether I discussed it with

  Siew Ann or my idea. Maybe Siew Ann suggested it to save income tax….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Are you suggesting that a 22 year-old

  girl who is not a director of the company has any say in where the money is to come from?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. She can suggest.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. But you decide?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35.    Having determined

that it was the defendant who drafted the terms of the memorandum, the implications of the

two options offered to Siew Ann will next be discussed. At the outset, it must be noted

that the 50,000 shares referred to in the first option amounts to 10% of the shares in the

plaintiff company. Siew Ann made it clear she was fully aware of the fact that she had

50,000 shares in the plaintiff company when she signed the memorandum. She had no doubt

whatsoever that the 50,000 shares stated in the memorandum referred to the 50,000 shares

that were held on trust for her by the defendant. In para 87 of her affidavit of

evidence-in-chief, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">It is indisputable that the Memorandum

  prepared by the defendant refers to me obtaining 50,000 shares in Tong Guan, which is 10%

  of the issued capital of Tong Guan. These shares were supposed to have been given to me.

  If I was not entitled to any shares, and only received the $100,000 as ‘a reward for

  her services’, what was the purpose of the Memorandum? Why should there be any

  reference to shares at all?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36.    More significantly,

Siew Ann asserted that both she and the defendant were fully aware of the purpose of the

payment to her of $100,000. Her evidence, during re-examination, is as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q.    By accepting the

  $100,000, what was to happen to the shares held on trust for you?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. They would belong to the defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Was this expressly discussed between

  you and the defendant?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. What did he say to you?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. He told me that by accepting the

  $100,000, I no longer had 10% share in the company.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. It was clear to the two of you that you

  were selling him your 10%?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37.    Siew Ann added that

she was convinced that the defendant did not intend to give her the 10% in question and

that he wanted to keep her shares by paying her $100,000. She said that her main aim in

accepting the $100,000 instead of the 50,000 shares was to stop the family quarrel over

the defendant’s failure to transfer her 10% to her. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38.    According to the

defendant, the 50,000 shares referred to in the memorandum were intended to be new shares

to be issued to Siew Ann. He thus denies buying any shares from Siew Ann. His evidence is

not convincing. For a start, he did not explain how the new shares were to be paid for.

When cross-examined, he merely said that "the company will pay the incentive to her

and she can pay for the shares". His evidence is as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Is it your case that the 50,000 shares

  referred to in the memorandum were to be new shares to be allotted.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Who was going to pay for the shares?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. The company will pay the incentive to

  her and she can pay for the shares.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. This was not stated in your affidavit.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Why should I say?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Can you issue shares without the

  directors’ consent?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. They all agreed. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39.    As far as the

defendant’s claim that his fellow directors agreed to the issue of new shares is

concerned, none of his fellow directors were asked whether or not they knew anything about

the proposed increase of shares or the method of paying for them when they were giving

evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40.    I now turn to the

second option offered to Siew Ann, which was that she would receive $100,000 if she worked

for the plaintiffs for five years. It was not disputed that if Siew Ann opted to take the

$100,000, she could leave the plaintiffs in 1987. On the other hand, if she opted for the

50,000 shares, she would have had to work for the plaintiffs for a further 3 years, that

is until 1990. Siew Ann was not keen to work for the plaintiffs and the defendant admitted

that he was aware of this. In view of this, counsel for the plaintiffs contended that the

defendant offered his sister the more attractive second option, which allowed her to leave

the company at an earlier date, to tempt her to surrender her shares for $100,000, a very

large sum of money for a young lady, who was then earning only $1,000 per month. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41.    The defendant

asserted that both options were intended to induce Siew Ann to remain in the employment of

the plaintiffs. He did not agree that the second option was more attractive to Siew Ann

than the first option. In his view, the first option of 50,000 shares was the more

attractive option. However, he was unable to show why the offer of 50,000 shares was, for

Siew Ann, a better alternative than $100,000 in cash. When cross-examined, he said: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Look at your evidence that the first

  option is a better option. In 1986, had the company declared any dividends to the

  shareholders?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. No.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Could Ong Siew Ann sell her shares to

  the public?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. No.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Realistically, she could only sell the

  shares to the siblings?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Are you realistically saying that

  50,000 shares is a better option than $100,000?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. And a more valuable option to a girl

  who did not want to work in the company?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Very difficult to say.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42.    Apart from being

unable to show that the first option was more attractive to Siew Ann, the defendant could

not effectively counter the plaintiffs’ assertion that the second option was more

attractive. When cross-examined, he answered as follows: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Your objective was to keep Ong Siew Ann

  in the company as long as possible?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Based on the two options, if Ong Siew

  Ann chooses to take $100,000, she can choose to leave the company earlier?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. If the memorandum was signed in 1986,

  this means that she could take the $100,000 and walk out of the company within a few

  months.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Your evidence is that she never wanted

  to join the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q. Are you serious that $100,000 was

  intended to be an incentive to stay.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A. Yes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43.    The defendant’s

explanation as to why the second option was offered to Siew Ann is unconvincing. At first,

he suggested that the $100,000 was an incentive for Siew Ann to work in the company. He

said that the company had just started its computerisation programme and Siew Ann could

help the company in this field. In paras 37 and 38 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief,

he said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">37. After my father passed away, I was

  concerned that the plaintiffs needed to upgrade its computer systems. At that time, a new

  computer accounting system had just been installed. The only member of my family who was

  familiar with computer systems and had accounting knowledge, other than myself, was OSA

  and therefore, she was the most suitable person to handle the accounts for the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">38. …. It was therefore decided that

  the plaintiffs would offer OSA an incentive to work in the plaintiffs. This was the reason

  why OSA had signed a Memorandum. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44.    At the material

time, Siew Ann was earning only $1,000 per month. Surely, her services could not have been

so valuable as to warrant an incentive payment of $100,000. With this amount of money, the

plaintiffs could have employed a number of more qualified persons to help in the

computerisation programme.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45.    The defendant

shifted his ground when he suggested that Siew Ann wanted to go to Australia for further

studies and that she was in need of money for her intended studies. However, Siew Ann

denied that this was the case. In para 82 of her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">At no time did I tell my brother that I

  was going to Australia to study prior to my leaving Singapore. In fact, I only informed my

  mother of my decision to further my studies a day before I left Singapore for Australia. I

  did not need any money from my brother or the Plaintiffs for my studies.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, Siew Ann did not withdraw her

$100,000 immediately. Instead, she left this sum of money with the company for a number of

years and her $100,000 was recorded in the plaintiffs’ books as a loan to the

company.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46.    Finally, while

giving oral testimony, the defendant suggested that the $100,000 was a way of making up to

Siew Ann for not having received any shares from the company and that the figure had been

suggested by their mother. This was not referred to in the defendant’s affidavit of

evidence-in-chief. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47.    The defendant’s

explanation with respect to the rationale for the options in the memorandum cannot be

accepted. If the memorandum was, as the defendant asserted, intended to provide two forms

of incentive to Siew Ann to remain in the service of the plaintiffs, the options provided

for therein did not make any sense. I thus accept that the circumstances surrounding the

memorandum support the plaintiffs’ contention that the defendant holds 10% of the

shares in the plaintiff company on trust for Siew Ann.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u><i> </i></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">No reason why Ong Siew Ann should have

been excluded</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48.    The plaintiffs

asserted that the late Ong Tong Guan was a very good father. As such, it was pointed out

that while he may have given nothing to his eldest daughter, Siew Hua, because she married

a competitor of the plaintiffs, it was unlikely that Siew Ann would have inherited nothing

from her father. The fact that a child is the only one excluded from the distribution of

his or her parent’s assets is, without more, not a sufficient basis for concluding

that the parent must have intended to provide for him or her. All the same, this assertion

of the plaintiffs will be considered because the defendant’s position on this matter

invites questions with respect to the credibility of his evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49.    When giving oral

evidence, the defendant declared that he did not know why his late father did not give

Siew Ann anything. When questioned by his counsel, he merely said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">They were not talking to each other and

  she belonged to the Year of the Tiger. I don’t know. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50.    However, in his

affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he was rather willing to suggest reasons as to why Siew

Ann did not receive any shares in the plaintiff company. The defendant explained in para

32 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that his father never intended to give Siew Ann

any shares. He said that this is evidenced by the original draft of the plaintiffs’

Articles and Memorandum of Association, which showed that Siew Ann was not one of the

original shareholders of the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51.    The original draft

of the plaintiffs’ Memorandum and Articles of Association does not help the

defendant’s case at all. After all, the defendant’s brother, Teng Chuan, who was

not an original shareholder of the plaintiffs, was given shares by their late father. On

the other hand, another brother, Boon Chuan, an original shareholder, was asked by his

late father to transfer his shares to the defendant. It follows that the Memorandum and

Articles of Association are irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether or not Siew

Ann’s late father intended to give her any shares in the plaintiff company.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52.    The defendant also

relied on the minutes of an alleged meeting of the shareholders of the company on 3 July

1984 which purportedly recorded his late father’s instructions but made no mention of

a trust in favour of Siew Ann. It was accepted that no shareholders’ meeting took

place on 3 July 1984. It was also accepted that the defendant gave instructions for the

minutes to be drafted. There is nothing in the minutes which is inconsistent with the

existence of the trust in question and the fact that the trust is not recorded in the

minutes does not prove that there is no such trust.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53.    The defendant next

asserted that for the purpose of distribution of shares, one of the matters taken into

account was the siblings’ contribution to the company. This was to bolster his case

that having contributed much to the plaintiffs, he deserved a bigger percentage of shares

than his siblings. However, this assertion is flawed. The defendant’s brother, Heng

Chuan, who worked for the company since 1973, received 20% of the shares in the company,

the same amount as his brother, Teng Chuan, who, in the defendant’s own words, was

given 20% because he "will contribute in the future". Besides, if it is true

that shares were given to Siew Kuan because she was then working in the company, this does

not explain why in the defendant’s scheme of things, Siew Lay was given no shares

even though she was working in the company when their late father passed away. Obviously,

whether or not the siblings were working in the company at the relevant time is not a

factor to be taken into account when deciding whether or not Siew Ann was given any shares

in the plaintiff company by her late father. What is abundantly clear is that the

defendant’s position with respect to why Siew Ann was not given any shares in the

plaintiff company is unsatisfactory enough to raise questions about the credibility of his

evidence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">CONCLUSION</font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54.    This case involves

an ugly family dispute between siblings. After considering the evidence and the

credibility of the witnesses, I hold that the defendant holds 10% of the shares in the

company on trust for his sister, Siew Ann. I find it most unlikely that all the

defendant’s siblings would come to court and lie about the existence of the trust for

the sole purpose of reducing the defendant’s shareholding in the plaintiffs. </font></p>
