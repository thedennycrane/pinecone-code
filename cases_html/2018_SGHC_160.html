The defendant has in turn sought an indemnity from the third party, who is the only other director and 90% shareholder of the plaintiff. The third party is the defendant’s ex-husband. The action is primarily founded on the defendant’s alleged diversion of a business opportunity, namely the supply of mashed potato machines to 7-Eleven, from the plaintiff to a separate company controlled by the defendant. The defendant’s defence is essentially that this diversion was consented to by the third party, pursuant to an oral agreement between them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In addition to the claim for breach of fiduciary duties, the plaintiff also brought a claim against the defendant for a liquidated sum of $15,899.08 for an alleged loan and certain unauthorised personal expenses which were charged to the plaintiff’s corporate credit card. The defendant argues that these were similarly consented to by the third party. Further, the defendant counterclaims against the plaintiff for certain salaries and sales commissions owed to her.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff to this suit is Zolton Techs Singapore Pte Ltd, a company set up by the third party in 2004 and involved in the business of supplying and maintaining machineries used for the production of food and beverages. The third party is a director and majority shareholder of the plaintiff, holding 90% of its shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendant, Ms Tan Chew Sim who is also known as Zoanne, was appointed a director of the plaintiff sometime in October 2006, shortly prior to her marriage to the third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Unfortunately, the marriage between the defendant and the third party did not last, with the defendant obtaining an expedited personal protection order against the third party in April 2011 and subsequently filing for divorce in September 2011. Interim judgment for divorce was granted in December 2013, and the parties’ appeals relating to ancillary matters were disposed of in May 2016 (see <span class="font-italic">TDT v TDS and another appeal </span>[2016] 4 SLR 145). This present suit was commenced in July 2011, but was stayed in January 2014 pending the resolution of the parties’ appeals relating to their divorce.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6  The present claim arose out of a business opportunity involving a contract with 7-Eleven for the supply of mashed potato machines. The plaintiff had provided maintenance services to 7-Eleven’s mashed potato machines since 2008, when these machines were supplied by Nestlé Singapore together with the powdered ingredients for the mashed potato food product sold at 7-Eleven outlets. In 2009, Nestlé decided to stop supplying the machines and sold all its existing machines to 7-Eleven for a token sum. As such, 7-Eleven had to source for a new supplier to replace its existing machines as each one reached the end of its life cycle. The plaintiff company had some spare parts with which to maintain the existing machines, but it soon became apparent that a more sustainable solution was required.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Hence, sometime in 2009, 7-Eleven’s manager Mr Lim Jit Sing (“Lim”) discussed with the defendant the possibility of having the plaintiff company supply 7-Eleven with new mashed potato machines. The defendant then spoke to the third party about this business opportunity, and the third party expressed interest for the plaintiff to take up the opportunity, especially since it meant that the plaintiff would be able to continue profiting from the maintenance contract with 7-Eleven. The defendant subsequently sourced for machines from China, together with another employee Eric Zhou (“Eric”), and obtained quotations from three different Chinese suppliers – Bianchi, FLZD and Happy Line.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 What happened after that is in serious dispute between the parties, but it is clear that on or around 15 July 2010, Lim sent the defendant an email requesting the plaintiff to arrange to install and demonstrate one mashed potato machine by the next week. Further, a purchase order for 100 machines dated 12 July 2010 was sent by Lim to the defendant, which purchase order was addressed to the plaintiff. The parties agree that it was the third party’s instruction for this purchase order to be obtained before the plaintiff company committed to purchasing the mashed potato machines from their sourced supplier. Subsequently, between September 2010 and May 2011, mashed potato machines were supplied to 7-Eleven by Stellar Corporate Management Pte Ltd (“SCM”), a company controlled by the defendant. This formed the basis of the plaintiff’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 As for the plaintiff’s second claim, this concerns a loan of $4,399.60 for the down-payment of the defendant’s personal vehicle and personal expenses amounting to $12,684.48 that the defendant incurred on the plaintiff’s corporate credit card. This latter sum included charges for gas and various spa and wellness expenses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The first claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The defendant’s case on the first claim is essentially that there was no breach of fiduciary duty on her part, as the third party had consented to her supplying mashed potato machines to 7-Eleven via a different company, and for her to keep the profits arising therefrom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The chronology of material events according to the defendant is as follows. After the discussion with Lim in 2009 regarding the possibility of the plaintiff supplying the machines to 7-Eleven, the defendant and Eric started sourcing for possible suppliers, and Eric flew to China from 30 September 2009 to 5 October 2009 to visit the sales offices of Bianchi, FLZD and Happy Line,

</div> The defendant also realised that the Nestlé mashed potato powder was incompatible with the Bianchi machine as the powder had a tendency to get clogged up in the pipes. The defendant therefore asked Eric to source for another supplier who could customise the machines as necessary. Eric soon discovered that Happy Line was willing to customise its existing machines at no extra cost save for the price of a mould.

However, according to the defendant, the third party raised serious concerns over the reliability of Happy Line, given that it was an unknown Chinese supplier located in a remote part of China. The third party was adamant that the plaintiff should not procure the machines from Happy Line, as the remoteness of its manufacturing plant would make it difficult to troubleshoot any problems that may arise.

Furthermore, Lim had gone to great lengths to obtain the purchase order from his superior, and failing to secure the machines would be a serious loss of face for him.

The third party indicated his agreement to the proposal, and mentioned that he “did not care so long as [the plaintiff company] was not supplying the machines”.

Even in the absence of any finding on whether the third party saw the mashed potato machines or realised their significance, what the evidence before me clearly shows is that the defendant in routing the machines through the plaintiff’s warehouse, did not behave in a surreptitious manner. This is wholly inconsistent with the plaintiff’s case that the defendant had diverted the business opportunity behind the third party’s back. On the contrary, the circumstances suggest that the defendant at the very least had the sincere and genuine belief that she had entered into the Mashed Potato Agreement. It is difficult to imagine why she would be so reckless and foolhardy as to carry out acts of brazen thievery in broad daylight and on the plaintiff’s very premises, without taking any precaution against the discovery thereof by the third party or any of the plaintiff’s employees. It should also be kept in mind that there are CCTV cameras around the warehouse, even though the defendant claims not to have ever looked at the recordings.

Stella’s evidence as deposed in her AEIC, and which was largely unchallenged on cross-examination, is relevant in two material aspects. Firstly, Stella testified that the defendant had approached her sometime in July or August 2010 to seek her assistance, as the defendant wished to use Stella’s business entity (SCM) to import mashed potato machines from a Chinese supplier to supply to 7-Eleven.

</div> Secondly, Stella also deposed that when she was confronted by the third party on 6 May 2011 regarding the involvement of SCM, the third party had informed her that he did not want the plaintiff to supply the machines because he was concerned about the reliability of the machines manufactured in China. That the third party had informed her of this was not something that arose in evidence at trial as an afterthought, as it was corroborated by the transcript of a telephone conversation between Stella and another employee sometime in November 2012, which transcript was produced by the third party.

Stella’s evidence is in all material aspects consistent with the defendant’s case, and the natural conclusion for this is that the defendant was telling the truth. The only other explanation for this consistency, which is highly unlikely, would be that the defendant had the amazing foresight to develop a highly elaborate scheme back in 2010 in which she left a trail of corroborating evidence with various would-be witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Joyce was called as a witness for the plaintiff, but her evidence actually corroborated the defendant’s case on the Mashed Potato Agreement in some aspects.

If she had been secretly diverting the business opportunity behind the third party’s back and in breach of her fiduciary duties to the plaintiff, it is hard to imagine why she would have spoken so candidly to the plaintiff’s employee without exercising greater discretion, especially since Joyce was a relatively new employee who only joined the plaintiff company in May 2010.

It would be hard to imagine that the third party would let the defendant divert a business opportunity away from the plaintiff if the plaintiff had nothing to gain from it, but the objective evidence suggests that the plaintiff did in fact benefit from the Mashed Potato Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the diversion of business opportunity issue  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The totality of the objective evidence discussed above, together with the material consistency between the testimonies of the defendant and the other witnesses, leave no doubt in my mind that the Mashed Potato Agreement did exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Given my finding that the defendant and the third party, who were the only directors of the plaintiff company, did in fact enter into the Mashed Potato Agreement, there is no breach of fiduciary duty on the defendant’s part, and consequently no need for any ratification of such breach by the shareholders. In any case, since the third party was a party to the Mashed Potato Agreement and a 90% shareholder of the plaintiff, any such ratification would have been easily obtained and calling a general meeting to obtain such ratification would have been a foregone conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As such, the plaintiff is not entitled to damages or compensation from the defendant for any breach of fiduciary duty. However, as it is not disputed that the defendant used the plaintiff’s premises and employees for the supply and installation of the mashed potato machines supplied by SCM, the plaintiff is entitled to payment for these services on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> basis to be assessed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the plaintiff ought to recover the sum of $15,899.08 from the defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It is undisputed that the sum of $15,899.08 can be broken down into a sum of $4,399.60 which went towards the down-payment of the defendant’s car, and a total sum of $12,684.48 which consists of a series of 37 transactions for various types of expenditure incurred on the plaintiff’s corporate credit card, minus the sum of $1,185.00 being the defendant’s pro-rated salary from 1 to 9 May 2011.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The sum of $4,399.60</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As the bulk of the trial had been focused on the plaintiff’s first claim, it is unsurprising that neither party offered much by way of evidence at trial in relation to the payment of $4,399.60 for the defendant’s car.

</div> In the absence of any positive objective evidence by either side as to the intended nature of this payment, I am inclined to prefer the defendant’s side of the story, since there is nothing on the face of the payment voucher to suggest that the payment was intended to be anything beyond a straightforward payment with no strings attached. That the payment was not intended as a loan is further bolstered by the undisputed fact that the plaintiff also made payments towards the third party’s personal car.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The credit card expenses amounting to $12,684.48</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 On the issue of the credit card expenses, the defendant has raised some preliminary objections on cross-examination and in her submissions that the plaintiff has not adduced evidence that it had in fact made payments for those expenses to the bank, whereas the defendant had produced some evidence to show that at least two-thirds of the sum had been paid by an associated company, not the plaintiff.

</div> Given the following findings, it is not necessary for me to arrive at a conclusion on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I am persuaded that the third party and the defendant did in fact come to the Marriage Agreement that the defendant could use the plaintiff’s corporate credit card to incur expenses both for the household and for her own personal benefit. It is not disputed that the third party himself similarly treated the plaintiff as a “cash cow” to fund his own expenses. It is only natural to expect that prior to the breakdown of their marriage, the third party and the defendant both formed the habit, pursuant to an understanding, to charge their personal expenses to the company accounts of the various associated companies, including the plaintiff. That the defendant was unable to recall the precise date of the Marriage Agreement does not suggest that it did not exist, but simply that it was not an express one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plaintiff appears to argue in its submissions that it is irrelevant whether or not the parties have the habit of treating the plaintiff as a “cash cow” to fund their personal expenses, as the defendant owes a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff to incur only expenses for the benefit of the plaintiff,

</div>
</div> whereas it is clear on the undisputed facts that the expenses incurred were neither incidental to the defendant’s role as a director of the plaintiff nor for the plaintiff’s benefit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I have certain difficulties with the plaintiff’s position. Firstly, it is not evident from the face of the pleadings that the plaintiff’s second claim is based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty. Rather, the statement of claim suggests that the second claim is a claim for a liquidated sum owed. Secondly, it must be kept in mind that the third party and defendant were the sole directors of the plaintiff company, and the third party a 90% shareholder. Even though the expenses incurred were not for the benefit of the plaintiff and were not incidental to the business of the plaintiff, the third party would have had the authority to ratify these charges in his capacity as the 90% shareholder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiff has also sought to argue that even if the third party and the defendant had reached an understanding whereby the defendant was allowed to incur personal expenses on the plaintiff’s corporate credit card, such an understanding was at best a “domestic arrangement not intended to create any legal consequences”, relying on <span class="font-italic">Balfour v Balfour </span>[1918] All ER Rep 860. This argument is a misguided one. We are not concerned here with whether or not a legal contract exists by virtue of the Marriage Agreement – it is clear that the defendant is not seeking to enforce the Marriage Agreement as if it were a contract, but rather relying on it as a defence to the plaintiff’s second claim. The defendant relies on the Marriage Agreement as evidence of the third party’s consent to the defendant incurring personal expenses on the plaintiff’s corporate credit card, and to show that he would have ratified these charges as shareholder if necessary. As such, whether or not the agreement was reached in a domestic setting is of no relevance. For similar reasons, the plaintiff’s argument that the Marriage Agreement is void for want of consideration or for being contrary to s 172 of the Companies Act is equally misplaced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As such, I dismiss the plaintiff’s second claim accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendant ought to succeed in her counter-claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As the parties are in agreement that the defendant is entitled to pro-rated salary from 1 to 9 May 2011, the main points of contention concern the defendant’s entitlement to salary in lieu of one month’s notice for her termination from the plaintiff, her entitlement to accrued annual leave as well as her entitlement to 5% of the plaintiff’s sales revenue for the year 2010.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Salary in lieu of notice </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the absence of any formal employment contract, I agree that this court should be guided by common law principles. The defendant has cited <span class="font-italic">James v Thomas H. Kent &amp; Co </span>[1951] 1 KB 551 and <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span>, Volume 2 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell) 1989 Edition for the proposition that a contract of employment for an unspecified period gives rise to the inference that the employment can be terminated by reasonable notice, and that one month’s notice is eminently reasonable. The plaintiff has argued that any notice period that the defendant was entitled to would have in any case been offset by her absence from work from 4 April to 9 May 2011.

</div> was at least largely internally consistent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Given that the third party at the very least accepted that there was a discussion on a performance bonus, I am inclined to believe the defendant that such an agreement was reached. The only question then was whether or not it was for the defendant to receive 5% of the plaintiff’s revenue or profits. The plaintiff has submitted that in view of the relatively small profits earned in 2010, it was unlikely for the defendant to have been promised what amounted to half of the plaintiff’s profits, when it was unclear at the time of the agreement whether the plaintiff would make any profits at all and whether the defendant would have contributed to this profit.

</div> However, as the parties have agreed that the bonus was meant at least partially as an incentive for performance, I find it much more believable that 5% of the plaintiff’s revenue or sales was the agreed bonus, since 5% of the plaintiff’s profit would have been a meagre sum that would have had no incentivising effect at all.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the defendant has not breached her fiduciary duties as the plaintiff’s director in supplying mashed potato machines via SCM.

Hence, I dismiss the plaintiff’s first and second claims against the defendant. However, as elaborated at [55] above, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for use of the plaintiff’s premises and labour for the installation of the new mashed potato machines on a <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> basis, with such quantum to be assessed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I allow the defendant’s counter-claim with regard to the 5% performance bonus of the plaintiff’s revenue as agreed between her and the third party, as well as her counter-claim for one month’s salary in lieu of notice.
