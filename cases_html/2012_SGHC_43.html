<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Defendants have appealed against my oral judgment with brief reasons
                    delivered on 31 October 2011. I now set out my reasons for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, Kamigumi Co Ltd, is a company
                    incorporated in Japan with one of its divisions engaged in the building and
                    construction industry. It has a separately incorporated entity in Singapore, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, (collectively, “the
                    Defendants”). Sometime in early June 2008, the Defendants heard of and
                    decided to try and secure the theme park contract for the Universal Studios
                    Singapore’s (“USS”) show and ride attractions (“the
                    USS contract”). They were successful. USS awarded the Defendants the
                    contract to erect and install the theme park’s eight show and ride
                    attractions at USS (“the eight attractions”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     Water World (“WW”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Jurassic Park River Adventure (“JPR”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     Revenge of the Mummy (“ROM”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     New York Special FX Spectacular (“SFX”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     Journey to Madagascar (“JTM”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     Dragon Junior Coaster (“DJC”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_g"></a>(g)     Canopy Tour (“C Flyer”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_h"></a>(h)     Pteranodon Flyer (“P Flyer”) – also called the Kiddy
                        Jeep Ride.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore carrying on the business
                    of building and construction. It is owned by Mr Ito Fumiyuki
                    (“Mr Ito”). In this case, the Plaintiff became the labour
                    subcontractor, supplying labour to the Defendants in the circumstances set out
                    below (“the USS labour subcontract”). Which Defendant it
                    contracted with is one of the disputes in this case. The Plaintiff’s first
                    quotation was addressed to and accepted by the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant (“the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement”), and
                    subsequently there was a second, identical quotation, backdated to the date of
                    the first quotation, addressed to and accepted by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (“the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement”) (collectively, “the
                    Agreements”). The other issue is, broadly speaking, the amounts, if any,
                    owed by the parties to each other in respect of various claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties have resolved two issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff has admitted to the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Defendant’s Counterclaim of $125,149.87 (inclusive of GST) being paid
                        by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to K2 Specialist Services
                        Pte Ltd for the bolt torque works.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Defendants, as they informed me on 25 April 2011, have decided
                        not to pursue their Counterclaim in respect of the sums paid to one
                        Mr Oshita.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The parties have also helpfully agreed on the remaining six issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_i"></a>(i)     Whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement between the Plaintiff
                        and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant remains valid and enforceable,
                        or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant has been discharged of all
                        its obligations under the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement following
                        the execution of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement between the
                        Plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Whether, under the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement and/or the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement, the Plaintiff is entitled to
                        claim the total value of man hours incurred less the sums paid to the
                        Plaintiff by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in the light of
                        Note (1) of the terms and conditions, which reads as follows: “During
                        work progress, if there are changes which are more than your original BOQ,
                        we will charge you accordingly based on our rate first quote to
                        you.”</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Whether the Plaintiff is estopped by convention from relying on the
                        Agreements to claim the total value of man hours incurred less the sums paid
                        to the Plaintiff by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Whether the Plaintiff has discharged the burden of proving, on a balance
                        of probabilities, that it has supplied additional manpower valued at
                        $3,134,965.50 (excluding GST).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_v"></a>(v)     Whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is liable to pay the
                        Plaintiff for its use of the lorry, and if so, the rate to be paid, having
                        regard to the fact that there was no discussion on the rate to be
                        charged</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     Whether Mr Hideaki Iwaki (“Mr Iwaki”) was in
                        breach of his duties as the Attraction Manager for the JPR attraction, and,
                        if so, whether the Plaintiff is liable for the sum of $74,900 incurred by
                        the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant in engaging CUL M&amp;E Pte Ltd
                        to provide an assistant for Mr Iwaki.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The following facts are not really in dispute. Insofar as they are, the
                    following paragraphs constitute my findings of fact. In early to mid-June 2008,
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s Mr Terayama, who
                    eventually became the Defendants’ project manager for the USS project,
                    heard about USS’s plans for a Universal Studio attraction on Sentosa
                    Island and alerted his colleague in Singapore, Mr Kamimura, a director of
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant. Mr Kamimura, an economics
                    graduate, had no actual construction site experience whether in Singapore or
                    elsewhere. The Defendants decided to bid for the USS contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had successfully worked with the
                    Plaintiff’s Mr Ito before, especially in Dubai, and turned to him for
                    its labour supply. Mr Kiyohara was a director in the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s building and construction
                    division and was in charge of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s Tsurusaki Branch in Japan. Mr Terayama was actually
                    employed by Hoei Sangyo Co Ltd and was seconded at the material time to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s Tsuruki Branch. He reported
                    to Mr Kiyohara. Since he started work at the age of 18, Mr Terayama
                    has worked and been involved in installation work of entertainment facilities in
                    Japan. However, he has never worked in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In August 2008, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s
                    Mr Kamimura met with Mr Sakaniwa of Resort World Sentosa
                    (“RWS”, or “the Employer” in building parlance) to
                    discuss the Defendants’ interest in the contract. Mr Kamimura brought
                    along the Plaintiff’s Mr Ito and Mr Michinaka to this meeting.
                    Thereafter there were more meetings between the Defendants and the Plaintiff.
                    Mr Terayama was the person in the Defendants with the experience in
                    building show and ride attractions, having been involved in a similar project in
                    Universal Studios Japan. It was not disputed that the Plaintiff and Mr Ito
                    had never done such work before. Mr Ito left the details of the USS labour
                    subcontract to Mr Michinaka to work out. It was soon apparent that the
                    Plaintiff and Mr Michinaka were having difficulty doing so as they had
                    never done this kind of work before. This too was not disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       There was an important fax with attachments dated 31 October 2008 from
                    Mr Kamimura to Mr Michinaka copied to Mr Ito, setting out in
                    spreadsheet format the Plaintiff’s quote, with:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     a list of the numbers and type of worker required for each attraction
                            (<em>eg</em>, lifting supervisor, foreman, mechanic
                        electrician, welder, rigger, signalman, fitter and forklift driver);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     the number of days work for each attraction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     the number of man hours required of each category of worker, (based on
                        “10 working hour(s): 8.00 - 19:00, Lunch 12:00 –
                        13:00”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     a request to multiply the man hours by 1.5 as the estimates were based on
                        experienced Japanese workers as compared to Singapore workers without the
                        experience; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_e"></a>(e)     the start and end dates for each attraction;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was not disputed that Mr Terayama prepared these attachments with the
                    foregoing details and figures based on his experience. This is clearly
                    illustrated from Mr Terayama’s initial inclusion of an electrician as
                    part of the required workforce of the Plaintiff. Whilst it is common for a
                    Japanese contractor to include electricians in their workforce, in the Singapore
                    context and practice, electricians are from separate electrical subcontractors
                    who have to be separately licensed by a statutory undertaker. Hence, no
                    electrician was included in the Plaintiff’s quote.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Michinaka worked on the quotation, no doubt discussing the final
                    figure with Mr Ito. A meeting was held on 20 November 2008 between
                    Mr Ito and Mr Michinaka from the Plaintiff and Mr Terayama and
                    Mr Kamimura from the Defendants to discuss the Plaintiff’s pending
                    quote. I find that Mr Michinaka had worked out the pricing on a Bill of
                    Quantities (“BOQ”) which was based on and incorporated all the
                    details and figures from the attachment referred to above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>, and this was discussed at the meeting. The
                    original BOQ can no longer be found, but the figures agreed upon are in the
                    Plaintiff’s quotation,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> which I will discuss below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 25 November 2008, the Plaintiff sent the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant its quotation for its supply of
                    labour and installation of equipment for the USS contract, marked to the
                    attention of Mr Kiyohara. This was “Agreed and Accepted” and
                    signed by Mr Kiyohara for and on behalf of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (this was the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Agreement). This formed the contract between
                    the parties and consisted of a three-page letter form with terms<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and a detailed breakdown for each of the eight attractions,
                    indicating the type of workers to be supplied, the sub-totals and totals of
                    man-days per type of worker, the number of hours per category of worker (based
                    on an eight-hour work day from 8 am to 5 pm), the unit rate and the amount to be
                    charged therefor, a two-hour overtime provision per category of worker, the
                    hours and unit rate and overtime amounts to be charged therefor, and three pages
                    covering the scope of works items the Plaintiff would cover. It bears repeating
                    that other than the pricing, these details and figures were based on those
                    worked out by Mr Terayama and referred to above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>. It is important to note that the text included the
                    following:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The next important fact occurred on 19 March 2009 when Mr Maeda of
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant sent an email to the
                    Plaintiff’s Mr Ito which was copied to Mr Terayama,
                    Mr Michinaka, Mr Kiyohara, Mr Kamimura and one Mr Morishita.
                    The subject heading was “Re: Regarding to Agreement” [sic]. This
                    email went on to say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would like to inform you of our decision on the matter as below after
                        discussion with Kiyohara at Tsurusaki Branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. The contract amount and terms and conditions shall be still valid but
                        the payment will be made through Kamigumi Singapore considering GST matter.
                        Therefore, we would appreciate if you could kindly re-issue all invoices
                        that were issued and acknowledged by Tsurusaki Branch under Kamigumi
                        Singapore. For further invoice, please issue under Kamigumi Singapore after
                        acknowledged by Tsurusaki Branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Therefore, agreement between your company and our Tsurusaki Branch in
                        the original contract <em>shall be still valid</em>,
                        but in terms of tax matter in Singapore, Kamigumi Singapore will issue
                        purchase order to your company based on the agreement between your company
                        and Tsurusaki Branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. As for payment guarantee by Kamigumi head office, Kiyohara will inform
                        you of further detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4. As for the payment schedule by Kamigumi Singapore, we haven’t
                        received Down Payment from RWS as it takes time to issue bank L/G. (Now we
                        are checking with head office about the issue as RWS requested to change the
                        content of L/G again). I will let you know the payment schedule
                        later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The only point I would make is that at the paragraph numbered
                    “2” above, the phrase “shall be still valid” appears
                    to have been inaccurately translated; I accepted the Interpreter’s
                    interpretation during the trial that the phrase should more accurately read:
                    “will be maintained”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Counsel for Plaintiff and the Defendants accepted and did not
                    dispute this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Mr Ito complied and sent a quotation on identical terms, backdated to
                    25 November 2008, to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, marked
                    for the attention of Mr Kamimura who then “Agreed and
                    Accepted” the same by signing beneath that phrase on behalf of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant (this is the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement). Issue (i) arises from this
                    transfer of payment obligations. It is undisputed that the first or first few
                    invoices were addressed to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, but
                    these were subsequently reissued and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant paid all sums invoiced by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There were delays to the project and the USS contract which were not caused by
                    the Plaintiff. This is not really disputed by the Defendants. Insofar as it is,
                    I find and hold that this has been proven by the Plaintiff, (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> below). Consequently, there was a very low
                    take-up rate of man hours that had been catered for, unutilised labour in the
                    first few months of the contract, and a subsequent need to accelerate works to
                    make up for lost time. The Plaintiff put in more workers and their workers often
                    worked overtime. The contract period overran the scheduled end date. The
                    identity of the party who requested the acceleration, the existence of an
                    agreement to pay for this acceleration, and the amount incurred for acceleration
                    were some of the issues that arose out of the USS labour subcontract. At one
                    point in time, RWS requested acceleration for the SFX attraction and extra work
                    due to unscheduled stockpiling of material at one part of the site, and the
                    Plaintiff put in the labour to do so. The Plaintiff raised an invoice for this
                    work, RWS paid the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, and the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, in turn, paid the
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     A large part of the dispute between the parties arose from these acceleration
                    measures and the deployment of additional and often overtime labour. The
                    Plaintiff did not submit any claim for additional interim payments during those
                    months where additional labour was deployed and overtime hours were clocked.
                    However, at the end of the contract period, they made a claim for the additional
                    work and costs. This is the background for issues (ii) and (iii) and.
                    Issue (iv) is an evidentiary issue arising out of this dispute. The
                    Plaintiff has conceded that it does not have detailed records of the additional
                    workers it had supplied and relied on the records and claims of its labour
                    sub-subcontractors or suppliers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     During the course of construction, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant used the Plaintiff’s lorry and driver to transport its workers
                    at the work site. This was not catered for in the quotation. During the course
                    of the contract, the Plaintiff did not submit any periodic interim claim in
                    respect of this lorry and driver, but contended that it was understood that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendants would not use the lorry for free.
                    Issue (v) turns on what, if anything, had actually been agreed between the
                    parties as to the use of the lorry and driver and whether the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is liable to pay for the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Another dispute related to one Mr Iwaki, who was supplied by the
                    Plaintiff to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as the Attraction
                    Manager for JPR. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant claimed that they
                    were very dissatisfied with Mr Iwaki’s performance and contended that
                    because of Mr Iwaki’s poor work performance, they had to hire an
                    assistant attraction manager from CUL M&amp;E Pte Ltd to assist Mr Iwaki.
                    The Plaintiff was therefore liable for this additional expense. Issue
                    (vi) arose out of this dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I now turn to deal with the Agreed Issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(i)   Whether the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement between
                the Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant remains valid and
                enforceable or the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant has been discharged of
                all its obligations under the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement following the
                execution of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement between the Plaintiff and
                the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The terms and conditions of the Agreements were identical save for the
                    contracting parties, the signatories for the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants and the backdating of the second
                    quotation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Plaintiff claimed that it entered into a contract with the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant subsequently asked it to allow the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to be used for Goods and Services
                    Tax (“GST”) purposes. The Plaintiff contended that save for the
                    invoicing and payment, it was agreed that the original contract would remain
                    valid and during discussions to reissue invoices to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, the Plaintiff claimed that
                    Mr Ito’s condition that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    was to guarantee payment by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to the
                    Plaintiff was acceded to.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Defendants claimed that there was a substitution of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant with the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant through the sending and acceptance
                    of the second quotation in the name of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was thereafter
                    discharged from performance of the contract. The Defendants contended that the
                    email of 19 March 2009, properly construed, meant that the original terms
                    and conditions of the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement with the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would remain unchanged, except that
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant would perform the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is common ground that the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement was made
                    between the Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. However,
                    once the work commenced, the Defendants must have realised that they were going
                    to suffer a great financial disadvantage if they could not offset the GST amount
                    in the Plaintiff’s bills as the USS contract was between RWS and the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, whilst the USS labour subcontract
                    was between the Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. This
                    was something entirely of the Defendants’ own doing. Hence, on
                    19 March 2009, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant made a request
                    for a change. The contents of the request for this change speak for themselves.
                    In the first paragraph of the translated email dated 19 March 2009
                        (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> <em>supra</em>), the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant stated that the contract amount and the “terms and conditions
                        <em>shall still be valid</em> but the payment will be
                    made through Kamigumi Singapore considering the GST matter” [emphasis
                    added]. The second paragraph is even more telling. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant unequivocally stated that the
                    agreement between the Plaintiff and their “Tsurusaki Branch in the
                    original contract” shall</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">still be <em>valid [maintained]</em> but in terms of
                        tax matter in Singapore, Kamigumi Singapore will issue purchase order to
                        your company based on the agreement between your company and Tsurusaki
                        Branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The meaning of that paragraph is incapable of any construction other than that
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement still remains afoot. As noted
                    above, this was made even clearer when, during trial, the Interpreter pointed
                    out that the word “valid” in the second paragraph was not a
                    correct translation. The Japanese word was more accurately translated as
                        “maintained”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was the Defendants’ own document. I therefore cannot
                    accept the Defendants’ contention that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Agreement was meant as a discharge of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Agreement and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant from the USS
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Further, under cross-examination, Mr Kamimura admitted: “My
                    understanding is that the contract remains valid.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Mr Kiyohara admitted that when he approached Mr Ito for a
                    change in contracting party, Mr Ito’s condition for agreeing was a
                    guarantee from Kamigumi Japan, <em>ie</em>, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. Mr Kiyohara replied to
                    Mr Ito that he would consider this and he did. But he did not reply or
                    follow through because at the end of March 2009, the Tsurusaki Branch was closed
                    and he was transferred to the Kamigumi Head Office at Kobe. However,
                    Mr Kiyohara then went on to say that he discussed the 19 March 2009
                    email with Mr Maeda before the latter sent it out. Although
                    Mr Kiyohara did not inform the Head Office about Mr Ito’s
                    condition for substituting the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant with the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, he did tell Mr Maeda of
                    Mr Ito’s condition: “I told him that parent’s
                    company’s guarantee is required.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Mr Maeda then told Mr Kiyohara to consider “[t]he
                    process of getting parent company’s guarantee [sic].”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I find Mr Kiyohara’s evidence on this point quite
                    unsatisfactory. Thereafter his evidence was nothing but dodging about each
                    question in an effort to undo what he had just said. I also do not accept his
                    reason for not pursuing the guarantee, <em>viz</em>, the
                    fact that the payments from the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant were
                    “successfully done” thereby implying that a Head Office guarantee
                    was no longer necessary. He chose not to answer questions and kept beating about
                    the bush, in an effort to justify the Defendants’ contention that a
                    substitution had taken place. I therefore do not accept his evidence on this
                    point. I find that for his own purposes and reasons, he did not pursue the
                    guarantee with the Head Office. I find that he knew Mr Ito had imposed a
                    condition for the substitution, and he discussed the contents of the
                    19 March 2009 email with Mr Maeda before Mr Maeda sent it out.
                    That email speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Accordingly, I find and hold that the 1<sup>st</sup> Agreement
                    between the Plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant remains
                    valid and enforceable. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant are jointly and severally liable to
                    the Plaintiff for all sums that are or may be due to it. For all sums due and
                    payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendants, payment by any one Defendant will be
                    good discharge of the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Much was made of the fact that a guarantee was never eventually issued. I find
                    that as the parties were all Japanese, there was an element of trust between
                    them. Many matters were dealt with verbally or informally and there was little
                    or no follow-up or documentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The issue of the guarantee does not really arise unless the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Defendant fails to pay any sum due to the
                    Plaintiff under the USS labour subcontract. Insofar as it is necessary, having
                    considered the evidence, I find and hold that the Plaintiff required a guarantee
                    of payment by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in the event that it
                    was not paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, for acceding to
                    the GST arrangements requested for by the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant. This guarantee was promised with the statement that Mr Kiyohara
                    would inform Mr Ito of “further detail”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In cross-examination, Mr Ito testified, and I accept his
                    evidence, that he understood from this that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant was to provide payment guarantee:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>

                            35, paragraph 3, what is written in Japanese, does it say, “No,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In any event Mr Kiyohara failed to follow up and Mr Ito did not
                    pursue the matter as he was in the thick of subcontract performance. Insofar as
                    it is necessary, if the Plaintiff had asked for specific performance, they would
                    be entitled to it. If so, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s
                    defence which relies on s 6, Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)
                    would fall away.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(ii)   Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to claim the total value
                of man hours incurred less the sums paid by the 1<sup>st</sup>
                Defendant in the light of Note (1) of the terms and conditions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Defendants claimed that this was a true lump sum contract in the sense
                    that a price for the construction and installation work for the eight
                    attractions was fixed and agreed upon. If, on the contrary, payment was to be on
                    a measurement basis, it would not have been necessary to make detailed
                    calculations for the estimation of man-days. Further interim invoices were
                    rendered on a milestone basis; this was a clear indication of a fixed price
                    contract. No interim claims were made for additional man hours, and there was no
                    mechanism for calculation of costs for the additional supply of labour and
                    additional man hours incurred. The only one time an additional invoice was
                    raised was for the SFX attraction, where the Plaintiff was specifically asked to
                    do additional work therefor and invoiced for that additional work. The provision
                    for changes in Note (1) of the terms and conditions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> meant an extension of the scope or timing of the works rather than
                    payment for additional labour for the same work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Plaintiff disagreed completely and contended that this was not a lump sum
                    or fixed price contract, pointing out that it had no experience at all in such
                    works and were pricing their work on the Defendants’ estimates. In these
                    circumstances they could hardly have agreed to a true lump sum basis which may
                    have turned out to be quite inadequate to cover their costs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> (The Plaintiff points to Note (1) of the terms and conditions, which

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     My following findings of fact, set out below, were not really in dispute,
                    especially for those leading up to the contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     It is common ground that the Plaintiff, to the knowledge of the
                        Defendants, did not have any experience in this kind of work. The quotations
                        in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement were provided by the
                        Defendants as an estimate of what would be required. Mr Terayama (as an
                        employee albeit on secondment) of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Defendant and who had experience with this kind of work, testified in his
                        affidavit that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Kamimura told me that Ito did not have sufficient experience in show
                            and ride attractions and that he neither knew the number of workers
                            required for the works of this scale, nor the rate applicable for him to
                            supply workers for such work. Hence, Ito had difficult quoting. Given
                            this, I worked out a construction schedule and the number of man-hours
                            required to be supplied from Kosui based on my experience in the USJ
                            [Universal Studios Japan] project and provided the same to Kosui…
                            I <em>estimated</em> the manpower needed for the
                            USS project to be about 2,556 man-weeks (not including Saturdays and

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was a series of meetings in the latter half of 2008, during which

                        Mr Terayama, who represented the 2<sup>nd</sup>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     As noted at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> <em>supra</em>, pursuant to these communications, the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant sent the Plaintiff an email on

                        the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. The format of some of these
                        documents was provided by RWS to the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Defendant, but it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant (mainly
                            Mr Terayama<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and Mr Kamimura<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>) who prepared the documents and put in the figures for the
                        amount of labour required. This included, for each attraction, the required
                        labour in terms of man days, man hours, type of labour (foreman, rigger,
                        welder, fitter, <em>etc</em>), start and end dates, and
                        the T&amp;C periods. Mr Michinaka adopted the figures for the man days
                        per attraction but made adjustments to the particular categories of labour
                        and/or their number.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)     Based on the numbers, in particular the total man days per attraction, the
                        material and data put forward by Mr Terayama, through Mr Kamimura,
                        and the adjustments (noted at [(c)] <em>supra</em>) by
                        Mr Michinaka, the Plaintiff came up with a BOQ which was discussed at a
                        meeting on 20 November 2008, and the parties agreed on the figures. I
                        accept Mr Michinaka’s evidence that his low range was about
                        19,000 man-days and his high range was about 23,000 man-days, and the figure
                        finally adopted was 20,611 man days.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> This BOQ no longer exists, but the data, figures and numbers for
                        each attraction from this BOQ went into the manpower schedule quoted to
                        Kamigumi and prepared by Mr Terayama<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> - this was not really in dispute. These documents set out for
                        each attraction the type of labour required, the number of workers for each
                        category of labour, the number of man days per category of worker, the unit
                        rates (including those for normal time and overtime) and the total amounts.
                        I find and hold that this was, for all intents and purposes, having been
                        taken from the BOQ initially discussed, the BOQ referred to in the
                        Plaintiff’s quote dated 25 November 2008 which was accepted by
                        the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_e"></a>(e)     The contractual provision in Note (1) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Our quotation to you is solely based on your BOQ for your man power
                            schedule which received on 20<sup>th</sup> November

                            quote to you.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The meaning of these words is clear and unambiguous. It says “if
                        there are <em>changes</em> which are <em>more</em>” than the original BOQ [emphasis added], then
                        the Defendants will be charged for this extra work at the rates set out in
                        the quotation. It can hardly be clearer. This is clearly not the wording of
                        a lump sum or fixed price contract where the contractor has promised to
                        carry out and complete a set piece of work for a fixed sum agreed in
                        advance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_f"></a>(f)     The contract sets out in detail, for each attraction, the man days
                        required per category of worker, their respective unit rates or cost, the
                        normal eight hour day charge and a two hour overtime charge per day, with
                        appropriate totals and subtotals. For example, for the Canopy Flyer, the
                        Plaintiff would supply one Site Supervisor, for 122 man days in return for
                        the sums of$30,256 (for 122 MD for eight hours a day at $31 which is the
                        normal rate) and $11,346 (for the daily two hours overtimefor 122 MD at
                        $46.50 per hour, being the overtime rate of 50% more than the normal rate),
                        making it a total of $41,602 for the Site Supervisor for the envisaged
                        period. The other workers were worked out in a table similar to the building
                        up of a BOQ. Contractually this meant that if the Defendants required the
                        Site Supervisor for the Canopy Flyer for more than the 122 MD, they had to
                        pay more based on the rates set out in the manpower schedule.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_g"></a>(g)     The Defendants accepted the quote without demur and signed the contract
                        beneath the annotation which says “Agreed &amp; Accepted”. The
                        contract is in a simple letter form. The terms, albeit after translation,
                        were simple and brief. The Defendants did not question that provision or
                        said that it was wrong. Neither did they ask for rectification in the
                        alternative, if indeed that was the common understanding. In fact they
                        signed a second agreement with identical wordings and Note (1), again
                        without demur. The contract cannot, on any construction, be construed as a
                        lump sum or fixed price contract in the sense that the Plaintiff would only
                        charge the set price of $4,326,707 for the work it was to do: the Plaintiff
                        would suffer a loss if the work turned out more than envisaged and would
                        receive a windfall if the same turned out less than envisaged.</p>

                        “was” a lump sum contract. Even then, he qualified this by
                        saying that it was subject to RWS’s willingness to pay for additional
                            labour:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>

                                then Kamigumi will pay Kosui; is that correct?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Well, this contract was a lump sum contract. That’s why we

                                we are prepared to pay for such request.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2">Similarly, Mr Terayama’s evidence was that he
                        “expected” the contract to be on a lump sum basis,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> and that the margin given above the estimated labour requirement
                        meant that the manpower schedule was “essentially” provided on
                        a lump sum basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Mr Kiyohara specifically said he left all matters of the
                        BOQ to Mr Terayama and did not check it before accepting the quotation.
                        The evidence tendered by the Defendants’ witnesses was disingenuous,
                        and did not go far toward supporting the interpretation that the
                        Defendants’ understanding was that their contract was on a lump sum
                        basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_j"></a>(j)     These were all experienced building contractors. First, it is a well known
                        basic fact that the lump sum contract, in the sense contended by the
                        Defendants, is normally used where the construction design is well developed
                        and where the quantities can be estimated with some degree of accuracy. This
                        is certainly not the case here, not for installations of this nature, and,
                            <em>a fortiori</em>, not the case for such
                        installations in Singapore where no such installations have been erected
                        before. Secondly, seasoned building contractors do not make such basic
                        mistakes like construing the words used in Note (1) to mean a true lump sum
                        contract. Even if I give an allowance for non-familiarity with English,
                        which I do not for the purposes of my judgment as the key witnesses showed a
                        fair working knowledge of English during the trial, there can be no
                        mistaking the meaning of Note (1) and confusing it with a true lump sum
                        contract formulation and language.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_k"></a>(k)     The Defendants’ first attempt to get around this was to put forward
                        a theory that a margin had been built in for contingencies and unexpected
                        difficulties, thereby ensuring that this was a true lump sum contract and
                        the risk was passed on to the Plaintiff. I do not believe the
                        Defendants’ witnesses’ evidence of the meeting in Singapore on
                        19 January 2009 where they allegedly asked Mr Ito for his
                        confirmation that his quote covered contingencies, delay and/or difficulty
                        of work – “essentially that it was provided on a lump sum
                            basis”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> - and Mr Ito allegedly responded “I
                        understand”, thereby signifying his agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> I note that even this is couched in language that is less than
                        positive: <em>eg</em>,
                        “...essentially…provided for...” instead of it
                            “<em>was</em>” a lump sum contract,
                        and, “I understand” instead of “I agree.” I do
                        not accept their evidence on this score. It bears noting that initially the
                        Defendants’ witnesses all deposed that 9 December 2008 was the
                        date of this important meeting in all their Affidavits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> But upon receiving the Plaintiff’s reply Affidavit, which
                        proved that Mr Ito was not in Singapore on that date, and therefore
                        could not have been present at that meeting, the Defendants’ witnesses
                        changed their evidence just prior to cross-examination, stating the date to
                        be 19 January 2009 instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The Defendants’ witnesses obviously gave the earlier date
                        to show that the lump sum nature of the agreement was agreed on before the
                        work started. However, by 19 January 2009, the work had already
                            started.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> I find it implausible that such an important detail as whether
                        or not the contract was a lump sum agreement was not discussed at the
                        earlier meetings in October and November 2008, but only introduced after the
                        work had started in January 2009. I find that it is more likely that the
                        dates were deliberately changed in the Affidavits to reflect the more
                        favourable position for the Defendants that some agreement on lump sum was
                        made before the works started. There were also other inconsistencies which
                        surfaced during the cross-examination of the Defendants’ witnesses.
                        Mr Terayama, for example, gave evidence that he had not communicated
                        his estimate of 17,000 man-days until the 19 January
                            meeting,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> and that he did not explain to the Plaintiffs and
                        Mr Kiyohara how he had arrived at this figure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Just one page earlier, it had been his testimony that he had
                        explained that this figure was arrived at by taking a 15% margin of
                            20,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Given the discrepancy in Mr Michinaka’s figure of

                        question if it had been brought up. Yet, Mr Terayama testified that he

                        alleged margin for contingencies and bolster the lump sum theory. The
                        objective evidence shows, and on his own evidence Mr Terayama
                            said,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> that he estimated 2,556 man weeks which translated into 12,780
                        man days, and after multiplying that by 1.5 to cater for the difference in
                        quality between Japanese labour and labour in Singapore, he reached the
                        figure of 19,170 man days. This came close to the 20,611 man days settled
                        upon at the 20 November 2008 meeting which found its way into the
                        quotation. I have referred to Mr Michinaka’s evidence at
                        paragraph (d) above, which I accept, as to how this figure was arrived
                        at.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_m"></a>(m)     The second attempt was to contend that this was a
                        ‘pay-when-paid’-type contract. When the Defendants’
                        witnesses were hard pressed under cross-examination, they brought up this
                        theory that even if the fault in incurring the additional labour was
                        RWS’s and not the Plaintiff’s, the Plaintiff was not entitled to
                        payment therefor unless RWS paid the Defendants for the same. Both
                        Mr Kamimura and Mr Kiyohara’s cross-examination on this
                        point is very telling – if the Defendants were not paid, then no
                        matter what happened at site, or the facts of the matter, the Plaintiff
                        would not get paid. When pushed on this point, Mr Kamimura could not
                        explain why this should be so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I therefore find and hold that this was a contract to supply the categories of
                    workers set out in the manpower schedule,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> and at the rates and for the duration in man-days (comprising an
                    eight-hours day from 8 am to 5 pm and two hours overtime from 5 pm to 7 pm)
                    therein. If at the end of the day, the Plaintiff was required to supply more
                    labour, work longer hours or both to complete the installation, then the
                    Defendants would have to pay the Plaintiff for the extra labour at the rates set
                    out in the manpower schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There was a significant amount of evidence suggesting that the installation of
                    the eight attractions was delayed by various causes not related to or caused by
                    the Plaintiff or the Defendants. These included the late completion of
                    foundations by the main civil contractor to RWS, design changes, and delay in
                    delivery of material to site, followed by a sudden over-delivery of material to
                    site for the SFX and JTM attractions, and consequent prolongation of the
                    installation period to mid-March 2010. I need only refer to the evidence of
                    Mr Terayama himself where he admitted to there being numerous delays,
                    specifically in the completion of the foundations, the site conditions, design
                    changes and the like, and acceleration measures undertaken.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> He also unreservedly accepted paragraph 13 of Mr Ito’s
                    Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief which sets out the various delays. There were
                    many other witnesses, including Mr Kusano<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> and Mr Sundar Ramachandran,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> whose evidence was unchallenged on this point and who attested to
                    the same - the slow start, and the huge increase in manpower from the Plaintiffs
                    in September onwards. The same may be said of Mr Saminathan Supramaniam
                    (“Mr Saminthan”), the sole proprietor of Standard Rigging
                    (“SR”), who were the main labour supplier to the Plaintiff and
                    later became the sole supplier. Mr Saminathan was not cross-examined and
                    his evidence was therefore unchallenged. Many of the other witnesses gave the
                    same evidence, which I accept. I therefore find as a fact that there was a slow
                    start to this contract for the reasons which include those set out above in the
                    evidence. There were also instructions to catch up in September, which went into
                    October, November and December, with the result that the contract period was
                    prolonged and extended into March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(iii)   Whether the Plaintiff is estopped by Convention from
                relying on the Agreements to claim the total value of man hours incurred less the
                sums paid to the Plaintiff by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Defendants contended that the Plaintiff’s billing on a percentage
                    completion basis and the use of a “Final Invoice” embodied a
                    practice, and therefore an assumption, that the parties treated this as a lump
                    sum contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> That assumption was also supported by the Plaintiff’s
                    non-submission of time sheets for interim billing and the Defendants’
                    payment of on such invoices without requiring time sheets. The Defendants also
                    did not verify or check the number and categories of workers on site at any
                    time, leaving the Plaintiff to deploy the workers as required. The Defendants
                    relied on the fact that at the one time when “extra” work was
                    ordered by RWS (for the SFX attraction) which was therefore outside the lump
                    sum, the Plaintiff agreed, supplied the extra labour and later submitted its
                    invoice and the required particulars therefor, and the Plaintiff was duly paid
                    by RWS through the Defendants. In contrast, no invoices and required particulars
                    were submitted immediately following the supply of additional labour at the
                    other sites.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Plaintiff contended that there could not be any estoppel by convention
                    because there were oral communications between the parties which assured the
                    Plaintiff of payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff said that, at all material times, it was understood
                    that the Defendants would pay the Plaintiff for the additional labour required
                    for the works, which was why the final invoices were not prepared till much
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The parties accepted the requirements to establish an estoppel by convention
                    as laid down in <em>Singapore Telecommunications Ltd v Starhub
                        Cable Vision Ltd</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 195, namely that
                    –</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     The parties to a transaction act on an assumed state of facts or
                        law;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     The assumption is either one which both parties share or one which is made
                        by one party and acquiesced by the other; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     There is either an “agreement or something very close to it”
                        in respect of a shared assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Defendants submitted that they have satisfied these requirements and the
                    Plaintiff is estopped from denying that the contract was a lump sum contract. I
                    cannot and do not accept that submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The fact that interim billing is rendered on a percentage completion basis
                    does not invariably mean that the contract is a lump sum contract. Parties may
                    adopt this method of interim payment for other different reasons, for example,
                    as a matter of convenience and cutting down time-consuming paper work. This was
                    the very reason Mr Ito gave in his evidence, and I accept his evidence in
                    this respect:</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">First, I discussed with the project manager, Mr Terayama. Well,
                            because while we were discussing that it would be very tedious to count
                            every month how many people were deployed, so we have agreed that we
                            take certain percentage and issued an invoice, and Mr Terayama said
                            that after all, we are going to look at the total labour, the total
                            account, so it should be all right. So this was what we agreed.

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And you had this conversation [in relation to progress billing before
                            28 February 2009] because you wanted to issue a progress
                            claim?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, the first of all, it is progress billing, not progress payment.
                            By right, we are supposed to count how many people have worked how many
                            hours at the site, but it is very, very tedious. So I discussed with
                            Terayama-san, and we decided that for the convenience we just set the
                            percentage approximately.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was easier to just look at the stage of completion and set the percentage
                    for interim payment; it cut out a lot of paperwork and verification and
                    certification procedures. Moreover, this basis of interim payment was
                    specifically provided for in the contract: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Payment Terms</u> (1) The claim shall be paid
                        in cash within 30 days from receipt of our invoice which is calculated by
                        work progress at site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that a major assumption of manpower utilisation was based
                    on Mr Terayama’s figures and data which contained start and end dates
                    for each attraction, bar charts for utilisation of labour, a bell curve with a
                    maximum number of workers for June and July 2009 and with an end date of
                    30 January 2010. This term sat together with Note (1) on page 1 (referred
                    to at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> <em>supra</em>) in a simple contract that was essentially
                    2-pages long and almost in point form. As noted at [31(e)] <em>supra</em>, the meaning and import of Note (1) are clear and
                    unambiguous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Plaintiff’s failure to keep detailed timesheets is also explicable
                    on the above grounds. Mr Ito’s evidence was that he had not addressed
                    his mind to the financial issues until required, as all his time and effort had
                    been spent on ensuring a “smooth and speedy progress of the

                                was very, very tedious to trace and account all the
                                manpower</em> because, for example, the bill you send for this
                            number of labour at this attraction at this date, but what actually
                            happens in the site is that group of people may shift to another
                            attraction in the afternoon so we really cannot trace everybody.
                            That’s one thing and I need to highlight to you that in this
                            invoice it is written in English, “Supply labours and
                            installation of equipment for above project”, but while this is
                            what I wrote in English, I think my English was not right. Actually, it
                            should be, “Supply labours for installation of equipment for
                            above project.” I think it should be that way. It was my mistake,
                            I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now, the second part of my question you haven’t answered so let
                            me just ask that part. Later, at the end of the project, it was your
                            intention, then, to count up you [sic] the amount of labour supplied to

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So it is your evidence, then, that it is not important for the
                            supplier to present any records to the receiver of labour and should
                            just leave it up to the receiver of labour to check according to how
                            they want to check?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, basically, we have to keep the record, but the user, the one who

                            Mr Morishita and Mr Morishita said that he would check

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Importantly, I also find the immediate reaction of the Defendants when the
                    Plaintiff presented its claim telling. Mr Terayama did not protest that
                    this was a lump sum contract and the Plaintiff could not present such a claim,
                        <em>ie</em>, as if it was a measurement
                        contract,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> and neither did Mr Kiyohara<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> until a later stage. Their reactions at the stage of service were
                    merely to check the figures,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> and to attempt to persuade Mr Ito to reduce his

                    contracted on a lump sum basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     There was another incident that goes against the Defendants’ contention
                    of a lump sum contract. I accept the evidence of Mr Kusano who testified
                    that RWS asked Mr Terayama, in his presence, and Mr Terayama, in turn,
                    asked the Plaintiff to deploy more workers for the JTM and SFX attractions in a
                    bid to clear a sudden surge in delivery or material for those attractions, the
                    storage of which was causing congestion problems at the site: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Four things are noteworthy:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Plaintiff was asked and did provide time sheets for a claim for
                        the deployment of extra workers for SFX; the Defendants received payment
                        therefor and the Plaintiff was paid in turn. If this was a lump sum contract
                        as contended by the Defendants, then it is strange that the Plaintiff was
                        paid for the deployment of extra workers for the SFX attraction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the Plaintiff was able to produce time sheets and other
                        information to support their claim and these documents were obviously
                        acceptable to the Defendants, who paid them for these claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, although the acceleration order was for both the SFX and JTM
                        attractions, the Plaintiff inexplicably got paid for one but not the other.
                        The reason is clear and I find that it was because RWS paid the Defendants
                        for one but not the other, and the Defendants took the untenable stand that
                        this contract was also a pay-when-paid contract: since they were not paid
                        for the JTM attraction, they did not have to pay the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, I accept the evidence of an independent sub-subcontractor, Kobo
                        Design’s Mr Onodera, who testified that there were a lot of
                        problems on site, many instances when work was interrupted or suspended, and
                        his workers had to work overtime to make up for the delay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> He was asked by Mr Terayama at the site, in the presence of
                        Mr Michinaka, Mr Ito and one Mr Mizota, to compile his
                        delays, variation and extra work done for the murals for the attraction,
                        again for submission to RWS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> This was certainly not behavior indicative of a lump sum
                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I find that the root of the Defendants’ problems lay in their agreeing
                    with RWS to do the work on a lump sum basis. Mr Kiyohara, under
                    cross-examination, said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, Mr Kiyohara, let’s say that there is no way at all that
                            you can catch up without getting more manpower and working more hours.
                            You have said that you will refuse to get more manpower and work more
                            hours unless RWS agrees to your quotation. Is that what you are saying?
                            I’m just trying to understand you.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We have to do our very best to catch up with the schedule, <em>because we have signed a lump sum contract with
                                RWS</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Kamimura explained that the Defendants claimed about $15 million from
                    RWS, but it appears that the Defendants compromised this claim for only $4
                    million and, reading between the lines, this sum was insufficient to pay all
                    their subcontractors’ claims:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I can explain to you briefly. The initial amount that Kamigumi
                            Singapore claimed to RWS was about 15 million, but that figure was
                            – I’m sorry. The approved figure at the end, by RWS, was
                            about 4 million. And that 4 million has been spent, all has been spent
                            as the payment for the subcontractors.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I therefore find and hold that there was no estoppel by convention as
                    contended by the Defendants which prevents the Plaintiff making this
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(iv)   Whether the Plaintiff has discharged the burden of proving,
                on a balance of probabilities, that it has supplied additional manpower to the value
                of $3,134,965.50</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Plaintiff claimed that the total value of labour supplied by it amounted
                    to $7,474,272.00. This figure was calculated by taking into account the
                    Defendants’ daily records, the Plaintiff’s time sheets recorded by
                    Mr Sundar A/L S Ramachandran (“Mr Sundar”) and the
                    attendance sheets prepared for Mr Johnson Cher
                    (“Mr Johnson”), the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Defendant’s Site Safety Officer. The Plaintiff accepted that it did not
                    keep proper records but has, in effect, reconstructed its claim from the
                    documents and information of other parties, especially its subcontractor,
                    Mr Sundar. The Plaintiff claimed that when one looks at these various
                    records and information, they tally and this proves the unpaid
                    ‘balance’ of $3,134,965.50.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Defendants relied heavily on the Plaintiff’s own admission that it
                    did not keep proper records; they contended that this failure was very telling
                    and showed how unreliable the Plaintiff’s claim was. Further, the fact
                    that these records were not produced prior to the trial showed that they were an
                    afterthought and could not prove that these sums were in fact owed by the
                    Defendants to the Plaintiff. These claims were unverified and improperly
                    recorded. The Defendants accordingly contended that the Plaintiff had failed to
                    discharge its burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Both counsel have informed me that quantum is to be decided on the basis of
                    the burden of proof. As I was informed, going for an assessment of damages will
                    not change anything as the state of the evidence cannot be improved upon. I
                    proceeded accordingly to determine whether or not, on a balance of
                    probabilities, the Plaintiff has proved its entitlement to its claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I also proceeded on the submissions as made by the parties. The Defendants,
                    after the hearing on evidence was concluded, stated that they looked at the
                    documents and noticed discrepancies in the figures which were not put to the
                    witnesses during cross-examination as they did not realise their significance. A
                    compromise was reached: rather than allow further cross-examination, the
                    Defendants were allowed to put in submissions and the Plaintiff was allowed to
                    reply thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As noted above, the Defendants themselves have admitted and insofar as they
                    have not been made above, I so make the following additional findings of fact
                    that:-</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was a slow start to the project, many attractions were not ready for
                        installation according to the programme and some workers were idling in the
                        first few months from February 2009;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     during the course of the works, there were numerous disruptions and delays
                        caused to the works resulting from, amongst other things, delays in
                        readiness of the site for the installation work to begin, late completion of
                        the foundations, delays in the main contractor’s works, design changes
                        and delays in the delivery of materials and equipment to the site;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     there were orders, and I accept the evidence of Mr Kusano (see
                        paragraph <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> <em>supra</em>) as well as other witnesses,
                            (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> and [42(c)] <em>supra</em>), including Mr Terayama’s admission
                        under cross-examination,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> to increase manpower and accelerate works; the manpower of the
                        Plaintiff increased dramatically from September to December 2009 and there
                        are many different documents which support this; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Plaintiff’s works did not complete by 30 January 2010 but
                        extended into mid-March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Plaintiff candidly admitted that it did not keep proper records by way of
                    time sheets<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> during the course of the works. However, the Plaintiff did not keep
                    any permanent work force (except for a very few key employees like
                    Mr Thuriraj at the supervisor/project manager level), and obtained their
                    supply of labour from their labour subcontractors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> In late September or early October 2009, Mr Ito centralised all
                    labour he provided for the works under SR. Mr Saminathan explains this in
                    his Affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was not until late September 2009 or October 2009 that the pace of work
                        picked up. At or around this time, Ito told me that the
                            1<sup>st</sup> defendant required more workers to make
                        up for the lost time, and that he would be recruiting more works. He told me
                        that <em>SR would have overall control of all the workers so
                            that they would be centrally administered and their work and movement
                            could be co-ordinated</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is important to note that this evidence was unchallenged in
                        cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> SR kept their time records of labour supplied. Mr Thuriraj also
                    kept his own time sheets recording his time spent working on site. It was from
                    this record that the Plaintiff constructed its claims. The Plaintiff basically
                    took the total amounts in terms of time charged by its labour subcontractors and
                    subtracted the payments made by the Defendants, leaving a balance which
                    comprised their claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     There were also other attendance records that were kept. These were taken from
                    the Daily Toolbox Briefings held every morning and evening when there was
                    appropriate work, and these recorded the workers present, who signed against

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Defendants also attacked the Plaintiff on their seemingly large mark-up
                    from their labour subcontractors to the rates in the contract. The Defendants
                    knew the rates set out in the contract, but had never questioned them. The fact
                    that the Plaintiff was getting its supply of labour at a far lower cost is no
                    basis to attack the accuracy of the Plaintiff’s claim, nor is it a
                    legitimate basis to say that, therefore, there was a huge margin to cater for
                    contingencies, showing that this was a lump sum contract. I need only say, for a
                    largely co-ordinating role, the Defendants themselves made a profit over their
                    subcontractors’ costs when it came to their contract with RWS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As noted at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> <em>supra</em>, after the evidence was completed, the
                    Defendants asked for a further hearing to make submissions because they noticed
                    errors and inaccuracies in Mdm Nasimah’s tables, the significance of
                    which they had not realised during the hearing. As it was too late to re-open
                    the hearing, and it would have caused significant prejudice to the Plaintiff to
                    have their witnesses go through the details of the claim when those questions
                    could have been put to the witnesses during the trial, I allowed the Defendants
                    the opportunity to put in submissions to point out these errors and inaccuracies
                    and gave the Plaintiff the right to respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The Defendants alleged overcharging of some $752,000 on the Plaintiff’s
                    own evidence, as some workers were classified in the ‘Sundar
                    Timesheets’ as riggers ($17 per hour) but were classified differently in
                    Mdm Nasimah’s table as supervisors ($23 per hour). They tabulated
                    some of these alleged detected differences in Annex 1 of their Further
                    Submissions. The Plaintiff’s response was that a perusal of the Sundar
                    Timesheets would show only 2 classes of workers: “Lifting
                    Supervisors” or “Riggers”. They explained that, under law,
                    both these categories of workers had to be trained and certified to perform
                    these tasks, and in SR’s case, many of their workers were trained and
                    certified to perform both tasks. However there is no requirement under the law
                    for Site Supervisors and Foremen to have special training or certification. The
                    Plaintiff was able to point to a letter dated 2 December 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> where the Plaintiff had identified some of SR’s workers to be
                    Site Supervisors and Foremen for the USS project. These workers were also
                    Lifting Supervisors and Riggers. Mr R Thankapandian, who was singled out as
                    an example by the Defendants, was identified as one of the suitable candidates
                    in the 2 December 2008 letter. The Plaintiff says, with some merit, that
                    they did have Site Supervisors and Foremen on site; there was no evidence of any
                    complaint by the Defendants that the Plaintiff did not have such people on site.
                    I therefore accept this explanation. I also do so for the more fundamental
                    issue. These questions could have been put to the appropriate witnesses but they
                    were not. This is especially so in the case of Mr Saminathan, the sole
                    proprietor of SR, but the Defendants chose not to cross-examine him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     On a balance of probabilities, I therefore find and hold that the Plaintiff
                    has made out its claim for the sum of $3,134,965.50 (excluding GST).</p>

                liable to pay the Plaintiff for its use of the lorry, and if so, what is the rate to
                be paid, having regard to the fact that there was no discussion on the rate to be
                charged</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Liability for use of the lorry</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The parties did not dispute that the Plaintiff provided a lorry and a driver
                    to drive the Defendants’ engineers and staff around the site, which was
                    spread out over a few kilometres. This request arose at a dinner meeting on
                    15 September 2008. The Plaintiff’s Mr Ito agreed to let the
                    Defendants use the lorry and the driver, but the price therefor was not
                    discussed. Mr Terayama thought it was provided <em>gratis</em>; Mr Kusano, the Attraction Manager for JTM, who was
                    at that dinner, did not think it was for free.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Having considered the evidence, including the documents that exist and the
                    witnesses on this point, I find and hold that the Defendants’ use of lorry
                    and the driver was not <em>gratis</em> and that the
                    Defendants would have to pay for its use. I do not accept
                    Mr Terayama’s evidence on this point. I note that in
                    Mr Terayama’s Affidavit, he never mentioned that the lorry was
                    offered to the Defendants for free. Rather, his evidence was that Mr Ito
                    did not say that it would be chargeable, nor did he invoice the Defendants for
                    it. Mr Terayama stopped short of saying that he understood that the lorry
                    was being offered for free, and instead gives his evidence as a hypothetical,
                    suggesting an <em>ex post facto</em> rationalisation of the
                        situation:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Mr Ito gave evidence that the lorry was primarily used to transport

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And in between, when it was not ferrying workers to or from the site,
                            it would be parked at the site?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">When it was not used in the daytime, it was parked. But it
                            doesn’t mean that the lorry was idle all the time.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">But, in effect, what you were offering was the use of the lorry when
                            it was at the site and when it was not being used for any other
                            purpose?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, actually, it’s the other way around. It’s a long
                            distance between the site office to the site, so it’s about
                            several kilometers, and it’s very difficult for all the workers to
                            walk from the site office to – it’s difficult for the
                            Kamigumi’s engineer to walk from the site office to the site, and
                            there was a complaint that there’s not transport, and the
                            Kamigumi’s engineer, Mr Kusano, requested for a lorry for the
                            transport purpose, and three of us discussed, and we found that it is
                            fastest and the easiest to use our lorry.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The notion that the parked lorry was not idle, contrary to
                    Mr Terayama’s evidence,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> was consistent with Mdm Nasimah’s evidence that the
                    driver was used during the day to transport tools within the site at a later
                        stage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> This was also consistent with Mr Kusano’s evidence that
                    the Defendants had 2 lorries, but that one was not there during the day, and the
                    other was not used for ferrying people.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> It was undisputed that the lorry was used to transport the
                    Defendant’s workers. Given the additional distance that the lorry would
                    have had to go to do so, and the disingenuous nature of Mr Terayama’s
                    evidence, I prefer Mr Ito’s and Mr Kusano’s
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rate to be paid for use of the lorry</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As to the quantum of rent to be paid for the use of the lorry, I find that the
                    driver was separately charged under the Time Sheets (“NAS-2” in
                    Mdm Nasimah’s “Affidavit), and his name appeared from June
                    2009 to 14 March 2010. I find that the main use of the driver and the lorry
                    was to ferry the Plaintiff’s workers to and from the site in the mornings
                    and evenings or at night, and, at a later stage, to transfer tools and equipment
                    to and from the eight attractions. The meeting was in mid-September 2009 and I
                    find that the lorry was used to ferry the Defendants’ engineers and site
                    staff about 1 week later; this continued to 14 March 2009. The important
                    point to note is that it was also used by the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff owned
                    the lorry; it was not hired from a third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I find and hold that a reasonable charge for the lorry, bearing in mind its
                    use and taking into account that the driver was charged separately, would be 40%
                    of $500 per day multiplied by 172 days (being 1 week in September 2009, 6 months
                    from October 2009 to February 2010 and 14 days in March 2010); this amounts to
                    $34,400 (excluding GST). The Defendants must pay the Plaintiff $34,400
                    (excluding GST) for the use of the lorry YN405X.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(vi)   Whether Mr Iwaki was in breach of his duties owed as
                the Attraction Manager for the JPR attraction, and if so, whether the Plaintiff is
                liable for the sum of $74,900 incurred by the 1<sup>st</sup>
                Defendant in engaging CUL M&amp;E Pte Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Mr Iwaki was guilty of a breach of duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Having considered the evidence and the rival contentions of the parties, I
                    find that Mr Iwaki was not delinquent in carrying out his duties to the
                    extent that the Defendants had to hire CUL M&amp;E Pte Ltd to carry out
                    Mr Iwaki’s duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Some of the factors which brought me to this finding include, first, the
                    evidence of Mr Ito and Mr Michinaka, whose evidence I prefer over
                    Mr Terayama’s evidence, and the obvious inconsistencies in
                    Mr Terayama’s evidence and performance under cross-examination. In
                    particular, Mr Ito specifies in his Affidavit the exact days when
                    Mr Iwaki was absent from work,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> and this was not challenged by the Defendants. Mr Ito also
                    provided a persuasive explanation for why Mr Iwaki was not seen at the
                    weekly meetings:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He said that he did instruct one of his juniors to attend many of the
                        weekly meetings on his behalf as he felt that the weekly meetings were a
                        waste of time, which time could be better spent overseeing the ongoing works
                        at the JPR attraction. He conceded that it could be his absence from these
                        weekly meetings that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant arrived at
                        the conclusion that he was often absent from work, but he said that the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant need only check its daily staff
                        movement records to confirm that, although he did not attend the weekly
                        meetings. He was nonetheless still at the site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This effectively refuted the basis for part of Mr Terayama’s claim,
                    which was that he was personally cognisant of Mr Iwaki’s absences
                    through his own personal observations and the observations of
                        others.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>

                            anybody else may have told you, that he failed to comply with his
                            contractual working hours by either starting work after 8 am or leaving

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     More importantly, Mr Terayama only gave discovery of daily toolbox
                    meeting records, which verified that Mr Iwaki was on site at the material
                    times, after the commencement of trial proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> Even then, Mr Terayama was evasive and maintained that these

                    medical leave and emergency leave at critical times, including in April, May and
                    June 2009.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span>Throughout the proceedings and on cross-examination, the Defendants

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Secondly, the Defendants never asked for Mr Iwaki to be replaced. On the
                    contrary, they admitted that they attempted to retain Mr Iwaki after his
                    contract expired in November 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Thirdly, the evidence was that Mr Iwaki did not get on with some of the
                    RWS staff. The email dated 10 June 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> tells the true story. When RWS wanted to increase manpower,
                    Mr Iwaki insisted on proper instructions, and RWS’s strong complaint
                    to the Defendants was: “he (Mr Iwaki) is constantly playing the
                    contractual game with us. When we ask him to increase the manpower, he is saying
                    that we need to pay for it.” To this very strongly worded complaint by
                    RWS, the Defendants’ response was: “We believe that his working
                    attitude towards job is not wrong [sic]. However, we apologize for any
                    inconvenience caused.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Fourthly, the Johnson Records showed Mr Iwaki’s attendance at site
                    and I do not believe the attempt to resile therefrom by Mr Terayama under
                    cross-examination (see <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Fifthly, Mr Terayama admitted that he never wrote any emails or letters
                    to Mr Iwaki complaining about his work or his need to improve.
                    Inexplicably, Mr Terayama gave evidence that he never made it clear to
                    Mr Iwaki that his conduct and work performance were not up to
                        standard:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span></p>

                    after Mr Kamimura’s cross-examination, an appointment which
                    Mr Ito said, and I believe him, that he knew nothing about.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Liability for the cost incurred for engaging CUL M&amp;E Pte
                Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I find the Defendants’ claim for payment to CUL M&amp;E Pte Ltd an
                    unwarranted attempt to make a claim that was without merit. Mr Michinaka
                    explained the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s real reasons for
                    engaging CUL M&amp;E Pte Ltd:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant engaged CUL
                        M&amp;E Pte Ltd (“CUL”) to, amongst other things, prepare the
                        daily reports for Iwaki, but this had nothing to do with Iwaki’s
                        alleged failures. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s
                        appointment of CUL arose because of an arrangement between the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant, RWS and CUL. RWS had appointed
                        CUL to undertake the maintenance of the attractions after the attractions
                        had been commissioned and had become operational. However, due to the delay
                        in the completion of the project, RWS requested the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant to take CUL into its payroll
                        for the time being as it (RWS) did not have the budget for it. The
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant agreed, and decided to deploy
                        CUL as Iwaki’s assistant for the JPR attraction, which was then still
                        under construction, and as his assistant, CUL also prepared the daily
                        reports for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Mr Terayama disagreed with this statement when it was put to him in
                    cross-examination, but, tellingly, he did not offer an alternative explanation,
                    nor did he attempt to defend his position. In the light of the reasons given
                    above, I accept the evidence of the Plaintiff and find that the Defendants
                    engaged CUL M&amp;E Pte Ltd to accommodate RWS, and not to make up for
                    Mr Iwaki’s poor performance. Having done so, they cannot now attempt
                    to recover the same from the Plaintiff. I therefore dismiss the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Defendants’ claim for $74,900 incurred by the

                        is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The Defendants are entitled to interest on the sum of $125,149.87 at the rate

                    payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     When I delivered oral judgment with brief grounds, counsel asked that they be
