At [12]–[13] of the Judgment, I wrote:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 The Plaintiff pleads that the “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">base</span> interest rate” prescribed by section 247 of the <span class="font-italic">Bürgerliches</span><span class="font-italic"> Gesetzbuch</span> (the “BGB”) – the German Civil Code – is 7.12% and that it is entitled from 1 July 2016 until the date of full payment. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 The Defendant does not dispute that the Plaintiff is entitled to 8% over the rate of 7.12%.

The Defendant now highlights, and the Plaintiff confirms, that this was erroneous, and that the correct rate of interest which should have been applied was 7.12%, not 15.12%. The applicable <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">base</span> interest rate should have been -0.88%, not 7.12%. Thus, 8% over -0.88% is 7.12%, which is the rate which should have been used.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Defendant suggests that this error stems from inconsistent usage, by the Plaintiff in its key documents, of the phrases “applicable base interest rate” and “applicable interest rate”. However, <span class="font-italic">my</span> incorrect usage of the figures in the Judgment in fact stems from the lack of clear distinction between these two phrases in the first place. At no point in the Plaintiff’s statement of claim, its written closing submissions, or its sole factual witness’s affidavit was the figure -0.88% stated, and if it had been, the character of the 7.12%

averments and submissions, it is not clear whether the figure 7.12% was meant to represent the <span class="font-italic">derived</span> figure (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, base rate + 8%), or whether it referred to the base interest rate indicated in the German Civil Code without the additional 8%. The Defendant now highlights that it addressed the Plaintiff’s error – particularly, the Plaintiff’s written closing submissions – in its own written reply submissions. I have re-examined the materials, and I accept that the Defendant did so, but the point was confined to a mere footnote.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Having said the foregoing, I will not attribute any blame for the ultimate error. I will only note that roundabout ways of expressing simple positions are generally undesirable, especially in cases such as this, with written submissions running into two to three hundred pages per side. The applicable rate of interest was not a disputed issue, and references to the “base” and “applicable” rates were unnecessarily oblique. It could simply have been stated that the rate of interest being claimed was “8% over -0.88% (the base rate provided by the German Civil Code), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 7.12%”. This would have avoided further, unnecessary ambiguity amongst a whole host of other contentious issues. I leave this point with the following admonishment: the role of counsel is to assist the court and this is best carried out by the use of plain and simple language that clarify rather than obfuscate the issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">A consequential point raised by the Plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 As stated at [2] above, I observed in the Judgment that the initially-applied interest rate of 15.12% was “rather high”. On this basis, I ordered that the Plaintiff’s contractual interest be terminated on the date of the Defence and Counterclaim, 30 August 2018, and thereafter, that they would only be entitled to the court-ordered rate of 5.33%, same as the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 At [236] of the Judgment, I said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">236 The Plaintiff had prayed for contractual interest to apply until the date of payment, but I think that it is just, on the facts of this case, to terminate the contractual interest at an earlier date for the following reasons. First, the contractual interest rate of 15.12% is rather high, and in the context of the present-day interest rate environment, it behoves this court to be cautious in making any such award. Second, I have found that the Defendant is entitled to a counterclaim that is of a similar order of magnitude to the Plaintiff’s claim. After setting off the counterclaim, the sum for which the Defendant is indebted to the Plaintiff would be greatly diminished. In these circumstances, I am minded to exercise the discretion vested in me under s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) to order the Defendant to pay the contractual interest rate on the Plaintiff’s claims up to 30 August 2018, the date of filing of the Defence and Counterclaim, with interest thereafter to run at 5.33%. I also order interest at 5.33% on the sum ordered under the Counterclaim to run from the same date, 30 August 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11  In light of the error and the correction of the rate of interest down to 7.12%, the Plaintiff submits that there is basis for me to reconsider <span class="font-italic">not</span> terminating the applicable contractual interest on 30 August 2018. Having considered the submission, I agree that difference between the Plaintiff’s contractual rate of 7.12% and the court-ordered rate of 5.33% is not as to engage the same considerations set out above. Indeed, apart from being almost <span class="font-italic">three</span> times the usual rate of 5.33%, 15.12% was, in my view, in and of itself bordering on usurious. The same cannot be said of 7.12% and the reason for not awarding the contractual rate no longer applies. I therefore change this aspect of my orders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Consequential changes to the Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Using the correct interest rate of 7.12%, and with the change stated in the paragraph above in mind, I set out the amendments to the following paragraphs of the Judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9 The parties tendered their written closing and reply submissions on 13 August and 3 September 2021 respectively. No further oral replies were heard. Having considered these submissions and the evidence put before me, I allow the Plaintiff’s claim for the principal sum of €1,526,224.76 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and its claim for</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> contractual interest</span> in full. I allow the counterclaim in part, and order that the Plaintiff pay the Defendant ₩1,969,018,000 with judgment interest of 5.33% from the date of the Defence and Counterclaim, 30 August 2018. I also find that the requirements for set off have been satisfied, and I will explain how the set off is to be applied from [236] to [240] below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 The Plaintiff pleads that the “base interest rate” prescribed by section 247 of the <span class="font-italic">Bürgerliches</span><span class="font-italic"> Gesetzbuch</span> (the “BGB”) – the German Civil Code – is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">-0</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">.88%</span> and that it is entitled from 1 July 2016 until the date of full payment. Applying this rate and starting date, as at 13 August 2021 – the date on which closing submissions were filed – the Plaintiff calculates that it is entitled to €519,074.76 in interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 The Defendant does not dispute that the Plaintiff is entitled to 8% over the rate of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">-0.88%</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> (ie, 7.12%)</span>. It contends, however, that the Plaintiff has no basis to claim interest from 1 July 2016. In support of this, the Defendant highlights that interest is only payable “from the expiration of the time provided for payment” (see [11] above). The earliest invoice on which the Plaintiff’s claim is based is dated 1 November 2016, and the invoice states that payment is to be made by the “3rd working day of [the] next month”. That is, 5 December 2016 – the 3rd and 4th of December being non-working days.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">228 As such, I find that the Plaintiff is entitled to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">7.12%</span> interest on each of their invoices, starting from the day after the amount fell due on that particular invoice.
