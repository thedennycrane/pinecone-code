        Quentin Loh J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       There were two originating summonses before me.
                    The first, Originating Summons No 352 of 2012/F (“OS 352”), was an
                    application by Mr Ong Hong Kiat (“Mr Ong”) for leave to inspect
                    and make copies of the accounting and other records relating to the financial
                    position of RIQ Pte Ltd (“RIQ”) pursuant to s 199 of the Companies
                    Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”). The second,
                    Originating Summons No 460 of 2012/J (“OS 460”), was an
                    application by Mr Lim Siang Hwee (“Mr Lim”) for an order,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that Mr Ong transfers 175,000
                    shares in RIQ registered under him (“the Shares”) to Mr
                    Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I dismissed Mr Ong’s application in OS 352
                    and allowed Mr Lim’s application in OS 460 on 25 January 2013 with brief
                    reasons. Mr Ong has appealed against my decision in both matters and I now give
                    my grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The issues arising from both OS 352 and OS 460,
                    as framed by the parties, are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     Issue 1: Whether there was a
                        concluded agreement between the parties for the sale of the
                    Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     Issue 2:
                        Whether such an agreement was rescinded by mutual agreement of the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     Issue
                        3: Whether such an agreement had been abandoned by the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     Issue 4:
                        Whether Mr Ong was entitled to access RIQ’s accounting and other
                        records relating to the financial position of RIQ.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The background facts in [4]–[8] are not
                    really in dispute; insofar as they are, they constitute my findings of fact.
                    What follows after [8] also contains my findings of fact. RIQ was incorporated
                    in Singapore on 13 May 1995, and was involved in the repair, installation and
                    commissioning of marine navigation and communication equipment on board marine
                        vessels.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Mr Lim was appointed a director of RIQ on
                    28 April 1998, and Mr Ong was appointed a director of RIQ on 19 January
                        2001.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It is undisputed that before 2012, Mr Lim
                    was the majority shareholder holding 325,000 (65%) shares in RIQ whilst Mr Ong
                    held 175,000 (35%) shares in RIQ. They were the only shareholders. Mr Lim
                    accordingly had the final say in matters relating to RIQ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Ong and Mr Lim were introduced to one another
                    in 1998, and were, at that time, operating their own businesses in the marine
                    equipment industry. After two years of working with each other, Mr Lim invited
                    Mr Ong to join him to work in RIQ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The arrangement between the two parties was that
                    Mr Lim would manage the marketing efforts of RIQ which would require him to
                    travel abroad, while Mr Ong would manage the “day-to-day
                    operations” of RIQ in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Mr Ong’s wife, Betsy Oh Siew Har
                    (“Betsy”), also worked in RIQ as its accountant from about 2007.
                    The relationship between Mr Lim and Mr Ong was an easy one based on
                    trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Some strain between them had developed in the
                    period of time leading up to the events in February and March 2012. The reasons
                    for this are not relevant but the real trouble started when Betsy informed Mr
                    Lim that the company had recorded a loss of $300,000 for the financial year
                    ending August 2011. Mr Lim was surprised and disappointed by this
                        news.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> However, this loss of $300,000
                    became a source of suspicion for Mr Lim when he noticed that RIQ’s draft
                    financial statements in February 2012 recorded a profit of $769,558.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On or about 19 February 2012, Mr Lim discovered
                    that a sum of $980,000 had been paid into his personal bank account from RIQ.
                    When he queried this, Mr Lim found that $980,000 had been paid both to him and
                    Mr Ong for directors’ fees and remuneration. Of the $980,000, $180,000 had
                    been booked as the annual salary of the directors, while the remaining $800,000
                    was booked as directors’ fees. These payments were effected by Mr Ong
                    without Mr Lim’s consent or approval, and were not authorised by any
                        resolutions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Having been under the
                    impression that RIQ had made a loss in the financial year ending 31 August 2011,
                    Mr Lim was therefore surprised that this large sum of money had been paid out to
                    the directors. This, subsequently, became an issue between the parties and it
                    led to the sudden resignation of Betsy, who was in charge of the RIQ’s
                    accounts. Mr Lim said this happened in the course of him pressing her to explain
                    the large payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mr Lim also gave evidence that these large
                    payments and the way they were booked would mean that RIQ was operating at a
                    loss for that financial year and that would have an adverse effect on their
                    relationship with the bankers, both in the present and the future, as well as
                    RIQ’s reputation when trying to secure business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    Furthermore, the General Manager of RIQ, Mr Abdul Jaleel S/O Mohamed Ally
                    (“Mr Jaleel”), gave evidence that in and around that period of
                    time, RIQ had also lost their dealership with a major supplier which accounted
                    for a significant amount of their annual turnover.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I accepted the evidence
                    of Mr Lim and Mr Jaleel on these matters as they made commercial sense, and
                    found that they constituted important background to the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events in and around 22 February 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       There was a meeting on 21 February 2012 between
                    Mr Lim and Mr Ong at the RIQ office where Mr Ong wanted to be bought out of RIQ
                    by Mr Lim at a very high price. There were obviously fairly severe disagreements
                    between the parties: Mr Lim was dissatisfied that Mr Ong’s work was 3
                    months behind schedule, that Mr Ong wanted to be bought out and at a very high
                    price, and that there were large payments out of RIQ without Mr Lim’s
                    consent or authorisation. Mr Lim admitted that the large payments out of RIQ
                    were the subject of their biggest quarrel in all their years working together.
                    Mr Jaleel’s evidence, which was not challenged, was that the staff told
                    him there were voices raised at the meeting which troubled them. It is not
                    disputed that Betsy resigned from RIQ suddenly with effect from 21 February
                    2012. This was after she was called into the meeting and queried over the
                    payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This was followed by another meeting on 22
                    February 2012 which ended with Mr Lim making an offer to purchase the Shares at
                    $200,000, with Mr Ong being allowed to keep the car which had been bought by RIQ
                    for his use (“the Car”). <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> At this meeting, it
                    was not mentioned between the parties that Mr Ong would have to pay back to RIQ
                    the directors’ fee of $800,000 which he had caused to be paid out to both
                    of them without proper authorisation or agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     According to Mr Lim’s evidence, Mr Ong
                    accepted this offer and as a result, surrendered his company credit card and
                    office keys to Mr Lim. Mr Ong’s evidence was that he never accepted any
                    such offer. He handed over the office keys because he thought that Mr Lim had
                    forgotten to bring his own set of keys and wanted to borrow Mr Ong’s set,
                    while the company credit card was not really used anyway and so Mr Ong just
                    handed it over.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> I found Mr Ong’s explanation of
                    the incident to be, to say the least, incredible. This kind of evidence is one
                    of the factors that made me prefer Mr Lim’s version of events when it
                    conflicted with Mr Ong’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events in between 22 February 2012 and 18 March 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After 22 February 2012, notwithstanding that
                    there were controversies as to whether Mr Ong had effectively resigned as a
                    director of RIQ, the company register still reflected that he was a director of
                    RIQ. This meant that Mr Ong was still required to sign off on company
                        cheques.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> This was also
                    supported by the SMS exchange between Mr Ong and Mr Lim on 24 February
                    2012:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Lim to Mr Ong at 1:35pm:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We need you to sign more cheque [<em>sic</em>] for
                        salary n supplier payment n also to sign the Financial Statement for 2011. I
                        planned for the transfer to be on 5 March 0930am. Of [<em>sic</em>] you require I can first issue the cheque to you
                        tomorrow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Ong to Mr Lim at 2:03pm:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You can sign the financial statement and ask someone to sent it to our
                        auditor together with the cheque on Monday morning and I will it there. As
                        for the cheque, you can ask Yoke Chen to prepare and I will sign it. I will
                        be going to batam tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I will sign the financial report at auditor office on Monday
                        morning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The main person to liaise with Mr Ong on the
                    signing of the cheques was Mr Jaleel. From early March 2012 to April 2012, Mr
                    Jaleel and Mr Ong met up frequently in order for Mr Ong to sign off on company
                    cheques. These meetings were arranged via SMS between Mr Jaleel and Mr Ong.
                    There was, therefore, constant contact between Mr Jaleel and Mr
                Ong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     One such SMS exchange was especially
                    important, and this was an SMS sent by Mr Jaleel to Mr Ong on 14 March 2012 at
                    1:28pm, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Raymond just checking if u have decided if Terry offer ok with u
                        without the lawyer stuff as he wants to settle soonest thanks</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Ong gave evidence in cross-examination that his understanding of
                    the meaning of “lawyer stuff” was a provision which meant that RIQ
                    would have no claims against Mr Ong after his resignation and vice versa
                    (“the No Claims Condition”) (see also [24] below).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Jaleel, on the other hand, gave evidence in cross-examination that
                    “lawyer stuff” meant that the parties should try to avoid getting
                    lawyers involved in the matter and just settle the dispute amicably. I preferred
                    Mr Jaleel’s evidence on this matter for obvious reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In another two SMSs sent by Mr Jaleel,
                    references were made to “positive news from Terry” and
                    “Good news”. When cross-examined as to what the positive or good
                    news might be, Mr Jaleel’s evidence was that he could not
                remember.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Notwithstanding this, I found Mr Jaleel to be
                    a credible witness. He answered questions in a straightforward manner and
                    without prevarication. From his evidence, it was also clear that he did not take
                    sides, as was his body language in court, towards either Mr Ong or Mr Lim. He
                    obviously got on with the both of them. Mr Jaleel was operating at a lower level
                    in RIQ compared to Mr Ong and Mr Lim. He did not strike me as someone with
                    in-depth and detailed technical knowledge or having the same kind of business
                    capability as Mr Ong or Mr Lim. He treated Mr Lim and Mr Ong as his bosses. RIQ
                    had just lost a major customer, and a shareholder dispute (whispers of which had
                    gone out into the industry) or a lawsuit between them was the last thing RIQ
                    needed. He was hoping that his two bosses would settle their differences
                    amicably and they could all move on, especially as RIQ was facing great
                    commercial challenges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events in and around 18 March 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Subsequently, on Mr Lim’s request, the
                    parties met at Tiong Bahru market on 18 March 2012. At this meeting, Mr Lim
                    offered to increase the price he would pay for the Shares from $200,000 to
                    $345,000. This was not disputed by Mr Ong. Mr Lim gave evidence, and I accept
                    his evidence, that this increase in price was made in order to better reflect Mr
                    Ong’s share of the retained earnings of RIQ. It was also Mr Ong’s
                    own evidence that Mr Lim told him that the correct value of the Shares, having
                    regard to the retained earnings, was $345,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The follow-up to this meeting took place via a
                    series of SMS exchanges between the parties. The first SMS was from Mr Ong to Mr
                    Lim on 19 March 2012 at 11:29am which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Good morning boss, after stu</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Good morning boss, you [<em>sic</em>] offer of S$145k
                        for the S$1.1M dividends brought down is too little, thanks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Lim responded via an SMS sent on 19 March 2012 at 11:47am which
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Your dividend on 1.3mil is 455k. Your share of 1.4mil is 590k. Total is
                        945k, amount already paid to you is 800k. Balance is 145k. If not when we
                        recall you will need to pay back 345k being overpayment by the accountant.
                        Please reply quickly I am out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The context behind Mr Lim’s reply SMS
                    was important. As a result of Mr Lim’s concern that RIQ’s balance
                    sheet reflected a loss, Mr Lim decided to book $800,000 of the $980,000 paid out
                    to the directors as shareholder dividends rather than to have the money
                    accounted for as directors’ fees. The $180,000 was considered to be
                    directors’ remuneration and would remain as they had been booked. This
                    would ensure that RIQ would reflect a profit on its balance sheet. In working
                    out how the dividend payments were to be structured, Mr Lim worked backwards. He
                    took his $800,000 as dividends on his 65% shareholding; on a 100%, it would come
                    to $1.23m which he rounded up to $1.3m, <em>ie</em> $2.60 a
                    share. Mr Ong’s 35% share of the dividends would be $455,000. This meant
                    that Mr Ong would still have $345,000 ($800,000 - $455,000) which had already
                    been paid out to him unaccounted for.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Mr Lim knew that
                    Mr Ong was in possession of $345,000 which was not properly sanctioned, and was
                    therefore using this as a bargaining tool since Mr Ong would not have wanted to
                    pay any money back. Mr Lim referred me to the accounts for these figures and
                    their calculation. Mr Ong would also know these figures as his wife was, until
                    she resigned, RIQ’s accountant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The SMS was also important in explaining why
                    Mr Lim increased the initial cash offer by $145,000, from $200,000 to $345,000.
                    According to Mr Lim’s explanation of the SMS, a number of factors were
                    taken into account in arriving at the figure of $145,000. As already mentioned,
                    based on a $1.3m dividend payment, Mr Ong’s 35% share would be $455,000.
                    However, $1.6m in total (being $800,000 multiplied by two) had already been paid
                    out by RIQ, which meant that there was an excess of $300,000 left unaccounted
                    for. Mr Lim added the amount of $300,000 to the approximate retained earnings of
                    $1.1m to arrive at the figure of $1.4m. Mr Ong’s 35% share of this $1.4m
                    would be $490,000. It should be noted that Mr Lim made an error in the SMS when
                    he wrote “Your share of 1.4mil is 590k”, which he later clarified
                    during cross examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> By totalling up Mr
                    Ong’s shares in the dividend payments and retained earnings, his 35% share
                    in RIQ would be $945,000 ($455,000 + $490,000). Since Mr Ong was already paid
                    $800,000, this meant that he was still owed another $145,000. It was on this
                    basis that Mr Lim increased his offer from $200,000 to $345,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Accordingly, I found that Mr Lim’s reply
                    SMS constituted clear and objective evidence that any offer made by Mr Lim to
                    purchase Mr Ong’s shares also included the term that the directors’
                    fee of $800,000 paid out to Mr Ong need not be paid back to RIQ although there
                    might be some re-booking of those sums so as to improve the negative balance
                    sheet (“the No Pay Back Term”). This was also supported by the
                    fact that Mr Lim in arriving at the retained earnings value of $1.4m must have
                    done so on the basis that the $1.6m paid out would not be recovered by RIQ,
                    since the excess $300,000 was also divided between the parties according to
                    their respective shares. It was clear both parties understood that Mr Ong could
                    keep the unauthorised directors’ fee payment of $800,000 he had received
                    from RIQ if he accepted Mr Lim’s offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     After another exchange of SMSs, Mr Ong sent an
                    SMS to Mr Lim on 19 March 2012 at 12:33pm (“the Acceptance SMS”)
                    which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Boss I accept your offer ofr [<em>sic</em>] S$345k
                        &amp; all documents ready to sign at auditor office tomorrow, thanks,</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was then followed-up by a further SMS exchange between Mr Ong and
                    Mr Lim on 19 March 2012 at 12:33pm:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Lim to Ong: You resign as director from 22<sup>nd</sup>
                        feb??</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Ong to Lim: 29<sup>th</sup> feb</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I found that the SMS exchanges and the
                    evidence given by Mr Lim on the matter were consistent with the instructions Mr
                    Lim gave the auditors, K S Ng &amp; Co (“K S Ng”), and the
                    corporate secretary, Supreme Corporate Services Pte Ltd (“SCS”),
                    via an email sent on 19 March 2012 at 4:09pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The material portion of the said email is

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events after 19 March 2012 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     After 19 March 2012, a number of material
                    events occurred. The first was SCS’s email of 21 March 2012, sent at
                    9.42am, to Mr Lim, which attached the revised AGM documents reflecting that the
                    parties would only receive $180,000 each for the financial year ending 31 August
                    2011, the declaration of dividends of $2.60 per share for the financial year
                    ending 31 August 2011, as well as the relevant paperwork for the resignation of
                    Mr Ong and the transfer of the Shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Importantly, Mr Ong’s draft
                    resignation letter contained the following provision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I acknowledge that I shall henceforth have no further claims against the
                        Company in respect of all matters and disputes which have arisen prior to
                        this date on the understanding that the Company shall likewise have no
                        claims whatsoever against me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This provision or other words to similar effect, was in essence the No
                    Claims Condition (see [14] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The documents were finalised on 23 March 2012
                    which triggered a series of SMS exchanges between Mr Lim and Mr Ong, when Mr Lim
                    sought out Mr Ong to sign the necessary documents. Although Mr Ong sought some
                    clarification about the situation and seemed to resist signing the documents, he
                    eventually agreed to sign the documents. However, the documents were never
                    signed, which resulted in the following SMSs sent by Mr Lim to Mr Ong:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28 March 2012 11:56am: Tmr 9.15am at auditor to sign all documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29 March 2012 8:55am: Kindly advise if you want to sign the document
                        today. If you do not rely [<em>sic</em>] I will take it
                        that you have changed your mind and is not signing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29 Mar 2012  12:04pm: Last chance please reply by 2pm
                        today.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 30 March 2012, Mr Jaleel messaged Mr Ong
                    via SMS at 6.15pm (“the Jaleel SMS”) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Raymond [<em>sic</em>] terry say SGD175K+car and
                        he will sign the total prior no claim letter also u sign the resign n sell
                        shares document by tomorrow pls advice thanks</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Ong alleged that Mr Jaleel sent him the SMS on Mr Lim’s
                    behalf in an attempt to negotiate. Mr Lim’s case is that he did not
                    authorise Mr Jaleel to negotiate the purchase of the Shares on his
                        behalf.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> On this matter, I found that Mr Jaleel
                    was not acting on Mr Lim’s behalf in sending the SMS to Mr Ong. It
                    appeared that Mr Jaleel had made a mistake on the price in suggesting the amount
                    of $175,000, which was significantly lower than Mr Lim’s offer on 18 March
                    2012 of $345,000. If Mr Jaleel was indeed acting on behalf of Mr Lim to
                    negotiate, it would have been unlikely that Mr Jaleel would have suggested an
                    even lower amount than previously offered. It might have been that the
                    “total prior no claim letter” was a reference to the No Claims
                    Condition, and this term might have been worth much more than the shortfall in
                    the price. However, there has been no evidence or submissions on the effective
                    value of the No Claims Condition to Mr Ong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 31 March 2012, Mr Lim suggested that the
                    parties meet to speak regarding the matter (“the 31 March 2012
                    SMS”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Lim to Mr Ong at 9.49am:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I want to settle with you without going to court so we need to talk. If
                        you want to then we talk today and get it done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This led to the parties meeting on 1 April
                    2012 in a final attempt to resolve the matter without having to go to
                    litigation. The parties had differences as to what exactly transpired during the
                    meeting. Mr Lim gave evidence that the purpose of having the meeting was because
                    he wanted to avoid litigating the dispute if possible, and also because he
                    wanted to understand why Mr Ong was not willing to follow through with the
                    alleged agreement. Mr Lim reiterated to Mr Ong that he should honour the alleged
                    agreement concluded on 19 March 2012. Mr Ong, on the other hand, gave evidence
                    that he confronted Mr Lim regarding Mr Jaleel’s proposal on 30 March 2012.
                    Mr Lim responded to this by saying that Mr Jaleel had made a typographical
                    error, and that his intention was to pay Mr Ong $345,000 and to allow him to
                    keep the Car. Mr Ong then informed Mr Lim that the amount was still too low, and
                    he wanted a valuation of RIQ. I preferred Mr Lim’s evidence regarding the
                    meeting, and found that Mr Lim only asked Mr Ong to comply with the terms of the
                    agreement due to his reluctance to take legal action against Mr Ong. From Mr
                    Lim’s perspective, the agreement was a good deal for Mr Ong, and future
                    litigation was to be avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 6 April 2012, there was a further exchange
                    of SMSs between the parties (“the 6 April 2012 SMSs”). The SMSs
                    are reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Lim to Mr Ong at 5.54pm:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[n]eed to move forward on our issues so now you feel my previous offer of
                        S$345K for all you shares in RIQ is too low and now you wants a valuation of
                        the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Ong to Lim at 6.26pm:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yes, I wants a valuation</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Lim to Mr Ong at 6.26pm:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[m]y previous offer of S$345K for all your shares in RIQ is a good
                        deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 6 April 2012 SMSs were the final recorded communication directly
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Whether there was a concluded agreement between the parties
                for the sale of the Shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There were three elements to this issue: (a)
                    the terms of the offer made by Mr Lim to Mr Ong; (b) whether there was valid
                    acceptance of this offer; and (c) whether any concluded agreement was incomplete
                    and should therefore not constitute a valid contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What were the terms of the offer made by Mr Lim to Mr Ong?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It was uncontroversial that Mr Lim did make an
                    offer to Mr Ong to purchase the Shares. The controversy surrounds what the
                        <em>terms</em> of this offer were. I should point out
                    that the differences between the parties on the terms of the offer was only of
                    consequence to the issue of whether there was a valid acceptance of Mr
                    Lim’s offer by Mr Ong and it is imperative that the terms of the offer are
                    identified right at the outset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is settled law that offer and acceptance as
                    concepts of contract formation constitute the objective manifestations of an
                    intention to contract: see <em>Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the context of an offer, it is stated in
                        <em>The Law of Contract in Singapore</em> (Andrew B L
                    Phang gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<em>The Law of
                        Contract in Singapore</em>”) at para 03.024 that “the
                    key element of an offer is that of intention” and that “[t]his ...
                    has to be ascertained objectively”. The learned authors further elaborate
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he offeree’s objective perception that the offeror has made him
                        an offer is essential in the objective test of ascertaining an offer. Thus
                        if the offeree reasonably believes that the offeror has made him an offer,
                        the offeror would be bound even if the offeror did not actually intend to do
                        so. This is not a departure from the objective principle because the law
                        asks what a <em>reasonable person in the offeree’s
                            position</em> would have perceived the offeror’s purported
                        offer to mean. It does not ask what the offeree <em>actually</em> thought. It may well be that the offeree’s
                        subjective intention coincides with what a reasonable person would have
                        thought but it is clear that the law takes as its guide the latter and not
                        the former. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It was undisputed by the parties that an offer
                    was made by Mr Lim to buy out Mr Ong on 22 February 2012. It was not clear that
                    Mr Ong had accepted that offer although the evidence suggests that was the case,
                        <em>viz</em>, the return of the company credit card and
                    the office keys and Mr Ong keeping the car. However, I did not have to make a
                    finding on this matter because it was uncontroversial that Mr Lim replaced his
                    initial offer during the 18 March 2012 meeting at Tiong Bahru market. I accepted
                    Mr Lim’s evidence that he increased the sum of money to be paid to Mr Ong
                    from $200,000 to $345,000 for the reasons set out at [20] above. Importantly, I
                    found that an objective assessment of Mr Lim’s intentions was that Mr Lim
                    intended to be bound by two other terms, <em>ie</em>, Mr
                    Ong keeping the Car and the No Pay Back Term. That it would not have made sense
                    for Mr Lim to replace his earlier offer with a figure which was lower than what
                    was previously made, given the circumstances, further supports this
                    analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Therefore, I found that the subsequent offer
                    made on 18 March 2012 only sought to increase the sum of money Mr Lim would pay
                    Mr Ong from $200,000 to $345,000. That was the final term being negotiated
                    – the price. This new price of $345,000 together with the term that Mr Ong
                    could keep the Car and the No Pay Back Term constituted the material terms of
                    the offer made by Mr Lim to Mr Ong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was there valid acceptance of the offer?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On the evidence, I found that valid acceptance
                    of the offer would depend on whether the Acceptance SMS constituted valid
                    acceptance by Mr Ong of the offer made by Mr Lim. A succinct definition of
                    acceptance is put forward by Professor Treitel in Edwin Peel, <em>Treitel on the Law of Contract</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed,
                    2011) at p 17, which was endorsed by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Gay Choon Ing</em> at [47]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An acceptance is a <em>final and unqualified</em>
                        expression of assent <em>to the terms of an offer.</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is further noted in Andrew B L Phang and Goh Yi Han, <em>Contract Law in Singapore</em> (Kluwer Law International,
                    2012) (“<em>Contract Law in Singapore</em>”)
                    at para 143 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The key requirement of an acceptance is that there be a final and
                        unqualified expression of assent on the part of the offeree to the terms of
                        an offer. The objective ascertainment of intention is likewise applicable to
                        determine acceptance as it is for an offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<em>Contract Law in Singapore</em> also states at
                    para 146 that “anything less than an unconditional and unqualified assent
                    to the terms of the offer renders the purported acceptance a <em>counter-offer</em> instead [emphasis in
                original]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Counsel for Mr Ong, Mr Devinder Rai
                    (“Mr Rai”), submitted that the Acceptance SMS did not constitute
                    valid acceptance of Mr Lim’s offer and was, at most, a counter-offer. This
                    was because the terms of the offer made by Mr Lim were that Mr Lim would pay Mr
                    Ong $345,000 and that Mr Ong could keep the Car in return for the Shares, while
                    the terms discernible from the Acceptance SMS were that Mr Lim would pay Mr Ong
                    $345,000 and that “all documents ready to sign”. That the terms in
                    the offer and the acceptance were different must mean that Mr Ong did not accept
                    the offer made by Mr Lim, but was instead making a counter-offer. In making the
                    submission, Mr Rai relied on the judgment of Judith Prakash J in <em>Overseas Union Insurance v Turegum Insurance Co</em> [2001] 2
                    SLR(R) 285 (“<em>Overseas Union
                    Insurance</em>”), which states (at [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As Treitel states (at p 41) an offeree who attempts to accept
                        an offer on new terms, not contained in the original offer, may be rejecting
                        the original offer and instead making a counter-offer. Such offeree cannot
                        later accept the original offer. To accept an offer, the offeree must, as
                        Prof Phang states (at p 96):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... unreservedly assent to the exact terms proposed by the offeror.
                            If, while purporting to accept the offer as a whole, he introduces a new
                            term which the offeror has not had a chance of examining, he is in fact
                            making a counter-offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When such a counter-offer is made, no contract will result unless the
                        counter-offer is accepted by the offeror.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I found, however, that the Acceptance SMS was
                    not a counter-offer, but constituted valid acceptance of the offer made by Mr
                    Lim. This issue is best analysed in two parts: why I found that parties intended
                    to be bound by the same terms, and why I found that parties did not have
                    different intentions on whether to be bound by any other terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Parties intended to be bound by the same terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As opposed to what Mr Rai submits, Mr
                    Lim’s offer was not merely to pay Mr Ong $345,000 and that Mr Ong could
                    keep the Car. As previously mentioned at [34], an objective ascertainment of Mr
                    Lim’s intentions would lead to the conclusion that another material term
                    of the offer was the No Pay Back Term. Although Mr Ong in the Acceptance SMS
                    only expressly referred to the $345,000, I found that he implicitly intended
                    that he need not pay back any money already paid out and could keep the Car, in
                    exchange for the Shares. Therefore, both Mr Lim and Mr Ong intended to be bound
                    by the same terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Parties did not have different intentions on whether to be
                bound by other terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     This issue is whether the phrase “all
                    documents ready to sign” found in the Acceptance SMS constituted a term
                    which Mr Ong intended to form part of the agreement which was not part of Mr
                    Lim’s offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     What does that phrase mean? Mr Rai submits
                    “all documents” is not a term of art.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Evidence was given by both Mr Ong and Mr Lim
                    that “all documents” would consist of the necessary share transfer
                    form, directors’ resolution for the approval of the dividend payout,
                    directors’ resolution for the resignation of Mr Ong, directors’
                    resolution for the approval of the Financial Statements for the financial year
                    ending August 2011, and Mr Ong’s letter of resignation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> These documents are ordinarily
                    considered to be administrative follow up or accompanying paperwork to give
                    effect to any buy-out agreement. It would be artificial to say that this was a
                    new material term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The only document which could have contained a
                    material term to the agreement by which Mr Lim might not have intended to be
                    bound, would be one of the conditions in Mr Ong’s letter of resignation
                    — the No Claims Condition. It was Mr Ong’s case that he wanted the
                    No Claims Condition and that Mr Lim had not agreed to that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I found that the first time the No Claims
                    Condition was “raised” in documentary evidence was in an email
                    sent from Ms Emlynn Chong (“Ms Chong”) of SCS to Mr Lim dated 21
                    March 2012 at 9:42am. That was not at the behest or initiative of Mr Ong. The No
                    Claims Condition set out in the draft resignation letter of Mr Ong as a director
                    was prepared by SCS. Ms Chong said that this No Claims Condition in the draft
                    resignation letter was part of a template resignation letter used by
                        SCS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> I accepted her evidence because she was not
                    challenged on this, and there was also some corroboration by the second witness
                    called by the defence, Mr Ng Yong Yi, who was an audit partner of K S Ng in
                    charge of the RIQ accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Lim’s evidence, which I accepted, was
                    that he saw the No Claims Condition for the first time in that email
                        attachment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Importantly, I found that this evidence
                    by Mr Lim was not inconsistent with the offer given by Mr Lim to Mr Ong that he
                    would not make a claim for the “unaccounted sum” of $345,000 which
                    was paid out to Mr Ong, as stated in the 19 March 2012 SMS at 11.47am (see above
                    at [18]). I find as a fact that Mr Lim agreed not to make a claim for the
                    “unaccounted sum”, but did not agree to the No Claims Condition
                    because he did not even contemplate such a term at the material
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I now turn to address whether Mr Ong intended
                    that the No Claims Condition should form part of the agreement. It bears
                    reiteration that this intention has to manifest itself on an objective
                    assessment of the circumstances. Mr Ong’s evidence was that he
                    contemplated the No Claims Condition before 19 March 2012 and did intend the
                    parties to be bound by it. However, this is not reflected explicitly in any
                    documentary evidence. In fact, the only documentary evidence showing that Mr Ong
                    contemplated the No Claims Condition or any other similar condition was found in
                    a draft resignation letter (distinct from the one drafted by SCS) Mr Ong sent as
                    an attachment in an email to Mr K S Ng of K S Ng and Ms Chong. This email,
                    however, was sent on 21 March 2012 at 12:29pm, and would not constitute evidence
                    of the parties’ intentions on 19 March 2012. Mr Ong never raised this
                    specifically with Mr Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr Ong put forth the construction that the
                    phrase “&amp; all documents ready to sign” in the Acceptance SMS
                    meant the No Claims Condition. However, those words clearly cannot be stretched
                    to imply the No Claims Condition. Importantly, when this was put to him in
                    cross-examination, Mr Ong conceded that “&amp; all documents ready to
                    sign” constituted a condition of the agreement only in his mind and was
                    not spelt out or expressed in the Acceptance SMS.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> It is clear on
                    any view that this unspoken thought of Mr Ong cannot become a term or condition
                    of the agreement. Therefore, I found that Mr Ong’s evidence of the No
                    Claims Condition as part of the “&amp; all documents ready to
                    sign” condition being in his mind could not help him establish that he
                    did intend the No Claims Condition to be a term of the agreement when he sent
                    out the Acceptance SMS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Furthermore, Mr Ong himself conceded that a
                    reasonable person looking at the SMS exchanges between the parties up to 5 April
                    2012 would have thought that Mr Ong intended to sign the documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Ong then tried to say that the words
                    “lawyer stuff” in an SMS sent by Mr Jaleel to Mr Ong on 14 March
                    2012 at 1:28pm referred to the No Claims Condition. This would suggest two
                    things: that Mr Ong contemplated the No Claims Condition prior to 19 March 2012,
                    and that Mr Jaleel knew about this condition which raises the possibility that
                    Mr Lim might have known about the condition as well. However, as stated above
                    (at [14]), the evidence of Mr Ong was in direct contradiction to Mr
                    Jaleel’s and I preferred the evidence of both Mr Jaleel and Mr Lim on this
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I therefore found that the No Claims Condition
                    was not part of Mr Ong’s terms when negotiating the agreement for the sale
                    of the Shares prior to 19 March 2012. At best, Mr Ong only sought assurances
                    that he would not have to pay back to RIQ the unaccounted sums of money paid out
                    to him (<em>ie</em> the No Pay Back Term). The No Claims
                    Condition which would constitute a material term of the agreement was an
                    afterthought of Mr Ong’s. Thus, the Acceptance SMS was not a counter-offer
                    by Mr Ong, but constituted valid acceptance of Mr Lim’s offer on 18 March
                    2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Accordingly, there was a valid agreement
                    between the parties formed on 19 March 2012, and the material terms of the
                    agreement were that Mr Ong was to transfer the Shares to Mr Lim in return for Mr
                    Lim paying him $345,000, Mr Ong being allowed to keep the Car, and the No Pay
                    Back Term (“the 19 March 2012 Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the 19 March 2012 Agreement an incomplete agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Mr Rai further submitted that even if an
                    agreement was found to exist, it should be “void for incompleteness
                    and/or uncertainty”. The words “&amp; all documents ready to
                    sign” in the Acceptance SMS was a material term of the agreement, and
                    since the phrase “all documents” was not a term of art, the Court
                    would not able to identify exactly the documents which the parties agreed would
                    be ready for signature. In support of his submission, Mr Rai cited the case of
                        <em>G Scammell &amp; Nephew Ltd v HC and JG Ouston</em>
                    [1941] AC 251 at 268:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There are in my opinion two grounds on which the court ought to
                        hold that there was never a contract. The first is that the language used
                        was so obscure and so incapable of any definite or precise meaning that the
                        court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual
                        intention. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Rai furthers cites <em>The Law of Contract in
                        Singapore</em> at para 03.166 for the proposition that an agreement is
                    not binding “if essential matters without which the contract is too
                    uncertain or incomplete to be workable remain to be agreed
                upon”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Mr Rai also claims that the parties themselves
                    were unclear as to what the term “all documents” encompassed, and
                    that parties were referring to different documents in the various SMSs sent
                    between them. This must mean that it was “difficult if not impossible to
                    objectively ascertain the intentions of the parties from the entire chain of
                        correspondence”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I cannot accept this submission at all and
                    held that the agreement was not unclear or incomplete such that it should not be
                    regarded as binding. As mentioned earlier above at [41], parties have given
                    evidence as to what “all documents” might be said to comprise of.
                    These documents are invariably administrative documents which were needed to
                    give effect to the buy-out. Furthermore, even if the exact documents could not
                    be identified, there were no documents that would have made the contract
                    unworkable or void for uncertainty. As stated in <em>The Law of
                        Contract in Singapore</em> at para 03.166 (continuing from the
                    previous quotation at [51]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Conversely put, the parties must reach substantial or essential agreement
                        before a contract can be regarded as concluded. A contract may be regarded
                        as having been formed even though it has not been worked out in meticulous
                        detail. Similarly if a contract calls for further agreement between the
                        parties, the absence of further agreement between the parties will vitiate
                        the contract only if it makes it unworkable or void for uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I found that parties had arrived at substantial or essential
                    agreement, and there were no material documents which could have required
                    further agreement between the parties. Therefore, the 19 March 2012 Agreement
                    was not an incomplete agreement, and is binding on the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It should not be forgotten that Mr Ong had,
                    without Mr Lim’s agreement, paid himself the same amount as Mr Lim despite
                    being a 35% shareholder by way of directors’ fees and remuneration. This
                    resulted in RIQ’s balance sheet reflecting a loss. The sudden resignation
                    of Betsy, who was in charge of the accounts, also speaks for itself. I should
                    also state that Mr Ong’s evidence was quite unsatisfactory. He feigned
                    ignorance of the meaning of questions, evaded answering questions, and when
                    caught out, still stood by his statements. Reading through his cross-examination
                    will clearly illustrate the unsatisfactory nature of his evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Whether the 19 March 2012 Agreement had been rescinded by
                mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Rai further submits that even if there was
                    a concluded and valid contract on 19 March 2012, this contract was rescinded by
                    mutual agreement of the parties. To support his submission, Mr Rai relies on the
                    following statement made by the Court of Appeal in <em>Gay Choon
                        Ing</em> at [53]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The aforementioned paragraphs suggest (correctly, in our view) that the
                        courts look at the <em>whole</em> course of the
                        negotiations between both parties in order to ascertain if an agreement is
                        reached <em>at any given point in time</em>. It should
                        further be noted that where such a point is identified, the mere fact that
                        negotiations are continued <em>thereafter</em> does not
                        of itself affect the existence of the agreement <em>already
                            concluded</em>. Of course, if the continued negotiations disclose
                            <em>an agreed rescission</em> of an agreement
                        already concluded, then the position is quite different. [emphasis in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Counsel for Mr Lim, Mr Lai Yew Fei (“Mr
                    Lai”), relied on the same passage in <em>Gay Choon
                        Ing</em>, and essentially contended that continued negotiations do not
                    necessarily mean that there is rescission by agreement. Mr Lai submitted that it
                    has to be clear that there was an agreement to rescind through the continuing
                    negotiations. Mr Lai further relied on the case of <em>Intense
                        Investments Ltd v Development Ventures Ltd and another</em> [2006] All
                    ER (D) 346 (Jun) (at [131]) for the proposition that the mere willingness to
                    negotiate further “does not itself unravel a binding
                        contract”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I reject the suggestion, that because Mr Bramley was prepared to consider
                        (and was even enthusiastic about) taking part in a renegotiation of the
                        contract terms, it meant that the existing agreement was somehow rendered
                        invalid or was terminated in some way. It is very common for businessmen to
                        agree a contract on one set of terms and then, as the situation develops,
                        suggest or request variations to the terms of that agreement. Sometimes
                        those variations can be agreed. However, if as here, the proposed variations
                        to a contract are not agreed, that does not mean that the validity of the
                        underlying contract has been affected in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Therefore, whether the events which occurred
                    after 19 March 2012 constituted further negotiations between the parties, and
                    more importantly, whether the further negotiations evinced an agreement to
                    rescind the prior agreement, were determinative of the issue. There were a
                    number of material events which occurred after 19 March 2012 which were
                    initially of concern.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The first event was the Jaleel SMS (see above
                    at [26]). Mr Rai submitted that Mr Jaleel was acting on Mr Ong’s behalf,
                    and that this was evidence of continuing negotiations. As mentioned earlier, I
                    found that this was not the case, and that Mr Jaleel had acted on his own
                    accord. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Mr Lim would have intended to negotiate
                    with Mr Ong by offering him less favourable terms than before (see above at
                    [26]). In any case, even if the Jaleel SMS constituted continuing negotiations
                    between the parties, it was not evidence that they had agreed to rescind the
                    earlier agreement. The continued negotiations in the context Mr Rai raised them
                    at best suggest that no agreement was concluded in the first place, rather than
                    establish that the parties had agreed to set aside the earlier
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The second event to consider was the meeting
                    between the parties on 1 April 2012. Mr Rai’s submission was that if there
                    was indeed an agreement between the parties on 19 March 2012, there would have
                    been no need for parties to meet on 1 April 2012. However, as stated earlier at
                    [27], the purpose of the meeting was because Mr Lim wanted to have another try
                    at persuading Mr Ong to honour the 19 March 2012 Agreement so that formal legal
                    proceedings would not have to be commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Finally, Mr Rai submitted that the use of the
                    term “settle” in the 31 March 2012 SMS meant that Mr Lim was not
                    claiming to enforce a contract, but was clearly still negotiating the sale of
                    Shares, and therefore impliedly agreed that there was no concluded agreement. Mr
                    Ong also treated the 31 March 2012 SMS to mean that the sale of the Shares was
                    still being negotiated. Therefore, even if there had been an agreement on 19
                    March 2012, this amounted to a consensual rescission of the agreement. This was
                    further reinforced by the language used by Mr Lim in the 6 April 2012 SMSs. Mr
                    Rai submitted that Mr Lim in using the term “previous offer” must
                    be taken to have meant that he did not believe that the sale of the Shares was
                    in fact agreed upon. With respect, Mr Rai’s submissions on this point were
                    incorrect. Although Mr Lim in the 31 March 2012 SMS did use the term
                    “settle”, the SMS clearly expressed that Mr Lim did not wish the
                    matter to result in litigation, which must have meant that he thought he had an
                    agreement to enforce in the first place. Mr Lai also submitted that when Mr Lim
                    used the term “previous offer” in the 6 April SMS, what he meant
                    to say was that the “offer that was accepted” by Mr Ong was a good
                    deal. Taking into consideration the context of the dispute, I found that the
                    mere fact that the term “previous offer” was being used would not
                    be sufficient to establish, on an objective basis, that Mr Lim had intended for
                    the 19 March 2012 Agreement to be rescinded. I also noted that the language used
                    by the parties, as evident in their SMS exchanges, along with their
                    typographical mistakes, militates against construing their SMS exchanges as if
                    they were properly drafted exchanges of those well versed in
                English.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Therefore, I found that the meetings and SMS
                    exchanges between the various parties in the dispute from after 19 March 2012 to
                    6 April 2012 did not clearly show mutual agreement between the parties to
                    rescind the 19 March 2012 Agreement. On the contrary, they clearly show Mr Lim
                    trying to get Mr Ong to honour his agreement and to avoid a costly legal battle
                    when his efforts were much better spent on RIQ’s business which had just
                    suffered a big commercial blow. On Mr Ong’s part, having agreed to the
                    buy-out terms, he changed his mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Whether the 19 March 2012 Agreement had been abandoned by
                the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Mr Rai submitted that the 19 March 2012
                    Agreement had been abandoned by the parties, and relied on <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> vol 1 (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) at para 22-027:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Abandonment.</b> It is open to the court to
                        infer that the parties have mutually agreed to abandon their contract where
                        the contract has been followed by a long period of delay or inactivity on
                        both sides. The party seeking to establish abandonment of a contract must
                        show that the other party so conducted himself as to entitle him to assume,
                        and that he did assume, that the contract was agreed to be abandoned
                            <em>sub silentio</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Rai also stated that his submission was premised on a “close
                    analogy ... with the position in relation to the consensual abandonment of
                    contractual arbitration clauses”. It was, therefore, somewhat surprising
                    that his submissions did not raise any authorities regarding the consensual
                    abandonment of contractual arbitration clauses. Furthermore, Mr Rai also based
                    his submissions on the same factual events which he relied upon to show that the
                    19 March 2012 Agreement was rescinded. As set out above, the various findings of
                    fact did not favour Mr Ong, and this meant that the claim in abandonment could
                    not be made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     With respect, Mr Rai’s submissions are
                    of no substance. Abandonment by prolonged inactivity in the context of
                    arbitration is of no application here. In <em>Paal Wilson &amp;
                        Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal (Hannah Blumenthal)</em>
                    [1983] 1 AC 854 (“<em>Hannah
                    Blumenthal</em>”), the well-known English House of Lords decision,
                    Lord Brandon identified two ways in which implicit abandonment may be shown (at
                    914):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in
                        this way, there are two ways in which A can put his case. The first way is
                        by showing that the conduct of each party, as evinced to the other party and
                        acted on by him, leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement
                        between them to abandon the contract. The second method is by showing that
                        the conduct of B, as evinced towards A, has been such as to lead A
                        reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract, even though it has
                        not in fact been B's intention to do so, and that A has significantly
                        altered his position in reliance on that belief. The first method involves
                        actual abandonment by both A and B. The second method involves the creation
                        by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting, as against A,
                        that he, B, has not abandoned the contract ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In that case, parties entered into a contract for the sale of a ship
                    which contained a clause for arbitration in London. When a dispute arose in
                    1972, the buyers and sellers each appointed an arbitrator but did not arrange
                    for the appointment of a third arbitrator as required by the contract, and after
                    various pleadings were exchanged in 1974, there was inactivity for three years.
                    In 1979, both parties began to prepare for the arbitration, with the buyers
                    preparing an expert report on the ship’s log books, and the sellers
                    tracing witnesses to testify at the hearing. This was followed by the sellers,
                    in 1980, seeking a declaration, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    there was an agreement to abandon the arbitration. The claim failed, primarily
                    on the ground that by tracing witnesses to testify, the sellers could not show
                    that they had acted on or significantly altered their position in relation to
                    any actual or reasonably perceived abandonment of the arbitration by the
                    buyers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The House of Lords in <em>Hannah Blumenthal</em>, in arriving at their decision, approved the

                        (“<em>The Splendid Sun</em>”), where the
                    claim in abandonment succeeded. In that case, the owners of the Splendid Sun
                    hired their ship to charterers under an agreement providing for arbitration in
                    London. After a dispute arose in 1969, arbitral proceedings were commenced
                    between the parties. This was followed by inactivity between 1970 and 1977, and
                    when the charterers received a letter from the owners enclosing points of claim
                    in the arbitration, they sought and were granted an injunction to restrain the
                    shipowners from proceeding with the arbitration. It was held that the proper
                    inference to be drawn from the conduct of the parties, in particular the long
                    period of total inactivity, was that the agreement to have the dispute submitted
                    to arbitration had been abandoned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In <em>Re An Arbitration
                        Between Hainan Machinery Import and Export Corp and Donald &amp; McArthy Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 354, Judith Prakash J considered an
                    abandonment claim raised by the defendants, and made references to the <em>Hannah Blumenthal</em> and the <em>The
                        Splendid Sun</em>. The claim was dismissed, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, on the ground that there was no long period of
                    inactivity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the present case, the inactivity pleaded
                    was that Mr Lim did not seek to enforce the 19 March 2012 Agreement since, as
                    alleged by Mr Ong, the terms of the sale of the Shares were still being
                    negotiated between them even after 19 March 2012. Even if Mr Ong’s claims
                    were accepted, the period of inactivity would only amount to a mere two months
                    (which was the time until OS 460 was filed), and cannot be considered an
                    adequate time period of inactivity for abandonment to be found. As suggested in
                        <em>The Law of Contract in Singapore</em> (at para
                    03.032), “[t]he question remains whether an intention to be bound can be
                    objectively ascertained from the conduct of the offeror”. With respect,
                    this must be correct, and I found that an intention to abandon the contract
                    could not be objectively ascertained from the two-month delay in Mr Lim seeking
                    to enforce the 19 March 2012 Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 4: Whether Mr Ong was entitled to access RIQ’s accounting
                and other records relating to the financial position of RIQ</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This issue arose when Mr Ong wrote to RIQ
                    requesting for an inspection of RIQ’s accounts pursuant to s 199 of the
                    Companies Act on 28 March 2012, and was rejected, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, on the basis that Mr Ong was no longer a director or a
                    shareholder of RIQ. Mr Ong then commenced OS 352. The relevant sections of s 199
                    of the Companies Act are reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Every company and the directors and managers
                            thereof shall cause to be kept such accounting and other records as will
                            sufficiently explain the transactions and financial position of the
                            company and enable true and fair profit and loss accounts and
                            balance-sheets and any documents required to be attached thereto to be
                            prepared from time to time, and shall cause those records to be kept in
                            such manner as to enable them to be conveniently and properly
                            audited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The records referred to in subsection (1)
                            shall be kept at the registered office of the company or at such other
                            place as the directors think fit and shall at all times be open to
                            inspection by the directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Art 82(e) of the Articles of Association of
                    RIQ provides that the office of director shall become vacant if the director
                    resigns his office by notice in writing to the company. It followed from the 19
                    March 2012 Agreement that Mr Ong was to resign as a director of RIQ with effect
                    from 29 February 2012. This was evidenced by the SMS exchange between Mr Ong and
                    Mr Lim following from the Acceptance SMS (see above at [22]). I found that the
                    SMS sent by Mr Ong constituted resignation in writing pursuant to Art 82(e). Mr
                    Lim was the director and majority shareholder of RIQ, and would be authorised to
                    accept Mr Ong’s notice of resignation on behalf of RIQ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As stated in <em>Walter Woon on
                        Company Law</em> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed,
                    2009) at para 10.47:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This right of inspection may be exercised only by directors and not
                        ex-directors, and any order of court authorising an auditor to inspect such
                        record on behalf of a director will be ineffective after the
                        director’s removal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, I found that Mr Ong had no right of inspection of
                    RIQ’s “accounting and other records relating to the financial
                    position of [RIQ], which are necessary to explain all the transactions of [RIQ]
                    for the financial years 2010 and 2011”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> pursuant
                    to s 199 of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In light of the foregoing, I made the
                    following orders at the conclusion of the hearing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr Ong was to transfer his 175,000
                        shares in RIQ to Mr Lim forthwith and in this respect there would be an
                        order in terms of Prayers (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) in OS
                    460;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr Ong was to
                        resign as a director of RIQ with effect from 29 February
                    2012;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mr Lim was to
                        pay Mr Ong the sum of $345,000 upon receiving the share certificates and
                        share transfer forms in respect of the 175,000 shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Car would belong to Mr Ong and
                        insofar as there was any trust or transfer document in existence, they shall
                        be of no effect upon conclusion of the above transactions, and insofar as it
                        is necessary, any documentation to effect the same shall be carried
                        out;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        necessary resolutions effecting the above were to be signed by both
                        parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_f"></a>(f)     for
                        the avoidance of doubt, Mr Lim and RIQ would not make any claims against Mr
                        Ong in respect of the monies relating to the No Pay Back
                    Term;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_g"></a>(g)     no order was
                        made with regards to Prayers (1) and (2) of OS 352; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_h"></a>(h)     I gave the parties liberty to
                        apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I took the view that costs must follow the
                    event in these two proceedings, and therefore awarded costs to RIQ in OS 352 and
                    to Mr Lim in OS 460, which were to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
