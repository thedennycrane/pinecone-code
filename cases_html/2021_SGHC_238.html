class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 Adopting the ancient adage that one’s enemy’s enemy is one’s friend may prove a risky strategy. It is usually resorted to by a cornered combatant in a desperate situation. This is how it was for the first plaintiff. Having assumed personal liability to the first defendant at a jacked-up interest rate for a loan originally made to his company, the first defendant sought to rely on an assignment of a larger debt said to be owed by the first defendant to the second plaintiff, whose friendship had soured after the sale of another business in disputed circumstances.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this judgment, the court must determine whether that larger debt existed, whether it was effectively assigned, and whether it was compromised or released before or after the alleged assignment. The question of the larger debt’s already having been compromised requires considering whether the first defendant and second plaintiff, from fear of mutually assured destruction, had made permanent peace, or merely temporary truce. In addition, questions arise concerning the enforceability of the first plaintiff’s alleged liability to the first defendant, as the first defendant required a higher rate of interest from the first plaintiff as guarantor than had been agreed with the company as principal debtor. Lastly, the first plaintiff has sought to rely on the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”) to avoid liability for the debt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The first plaintiff, Metupalle Vasanthan, is a Singapore national and a qualified medical doctor. I shall refer to him as Dr Vas. The second plaintiff is Laszlo Karoly Kadar, a Hungarian national also known as Thomas Kesser, a name he had originally coined for an unpublished novel he was working on. Hungarian by ethnicity, he was born in Romania and was originally a Romanian citizen. He is now resident in Goa, India. I shall refer to him as Mr Laszlo.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The first defendant, Loganathan Ravishankar, is now a Singapore citizen, and is originally from Sri Lanka. He is a self-described businessman who operates a number of businesses and investments. I shall refer to him as Mr Logan. The second defendant is Mr Logan’s brother-in-law, who was joined as a party because he held shares in a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and known as SkanTek Group Limited (“Skantek”) on trust for Mr Logan. This company was previously owned by Mr Laszlo. It held 70% of what has been described as the ICE Group, comprising a Malaysian company, ICE Mobile Sdn Bhd and a Singapore company, ICE Messaging Pte Ltd. Mr Lazlo sold his shares in Skantek to Mr Logan under an oral contract made some time in 2013, with the second defendant holding legal title to these shares. The alleged debt arises from this sale and I shall refer to it as the Skantek debt. As the trust has been apparently terminated in January 2014, such that Mr Logan became the legal owner of the Skantek shares,

The first is Dutt Devika Maria (“Ms Devika”), whom Mr Laszlo married in 2011 when Mr Logan apparently was the best man. She did not give evidence in these proceedings. The other four whom I shall mention were witnesses. Balamurali Balasubramaniam, who testified on behalf of Dr Vas and Mr Laszlo, was formerly the CEO of the ICE Group. He was replaced in 2014 by Suresh Kumar (“Mr Suresh”), who testified on behalf of Mr Logan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Mr Allahverdi Mohammad Reza attended a meeting on 15 January 2018 that included Dr Vas and Mr Logan, which followed shortly after the alleged assignment of the Skantek debt. I shall refer to him as Mr Reza. There was a fourth participant in the meeting, one Shervin Sharghy (“Mr Shervin”), who came with Dr Vas. Lastly, Mr Tan Siew Bin Ronnie testified on behalf of Mr Logan. I shall refer to him as Mr Tan. He was Mr Logan’s lawyer in 2014, and is both the author of a letter dated 25 June 2014,

It is the unpaid balance which is said to be the Skantek debt. When Mr Laszlo pressed for payment of the balance in 2014, Mr Logan claimed that Mr Laszlo had misrepresented its value. There followed a telephone conversation between Mr Laszlo and Mr Tan about the Skantek debt, during which Mr Laszlo is said by Mr Tan to have accepted that neither party had or should have any claim against the other. After this telephone call, neither Mr Laszlo nor Mr Logan took any steps against the other for a full three years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In the interim, Mr Logan started having some dealings with Dr Vas. Mr Logan lent US$350,000 to Clarity. I will refer to this as the “Clarity debt”. When Clarity did not repay the money, Dr Vas signed a letter dated 30 July 2017.

</div> The Logan Trust Deed was in respect of 7,000 of Dr Vas’s 100,000 shares in MyDoc. It acknowledged Dr Vas’s indebtedness in the amount stated in his guarantee as well as interest thereafter calculated until 15 January 2018. It further and provided that if this was not fully repaid by 15 January 2018, Dr Vas would transfer those 7,000 MyDoc shares to Mr Logan who would sell them and set off the proceeds of sale against the indebtedness and return any surplus to Dr Vas.

</div> I accept this. From Mr Laszlo’s evidence (via video link), I observed that he has a distinctive way of speaking. It is perfectly plausible that this conversation left an enduring impression on Mr Tan. Mr Laszlo was blustery, bombastic and evasive while giving evidence, and Mr Tan’s description of Mr Laszlo starting with a bang (how much he had suffered from Mr Logan’s failure to pay him) and ending with a whimper (how both should just get on with their lives with no claims against the other) rang true as an account of Mr Laszlo’s manner of speaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Mr Laszlo’s version that he ended with the threat of his taking legal action is wholly unbelievable. This claim does not fit with the three years of inaction that followed the telephone conversation. Had Mr Laszlo ended the call with how they could get on with their lives only after Mr Logan paid up, he would surely have followed up with a demand or even commenced proceedings against Mr Logan soon after. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Strikingly, Mr Laszlo’s counsel did not even put Mr Laszlo’s version of the conversation to Mr Tan. Instead, he suggested that Mr Laszlo was trying to find a way to resolve the matter without going to trial but was not agreeing to give up his claim permanently.

What is clear is that Mr Laszlo did not want to be sued by Mr Logan. That is why he initiated the call to Mr Tan in the first place. Attempting to disguise his intention with initial bluster strikes me as characteristic of his way of speaking. Litigation had been imminent before the conversation took place. I find that the call ended with Mr Laszlo saying in substance that he would not make any claim against Mr Logan if Mr Logan did not claim against him. I accept Mr Tan’s evidence that he reported this to Mr Logan and Mr Logan was happy with that outcome.

</div> Thereafter, both kept to the bargain until Mr Laszlo’s change of heart more than three years’ later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35  Counsel for Dr Vas has sought to characterise the conversation as at best an offer by Mr Laszlo to forbear to sue, in return for a like promise from Mr Logan, which Mr Tan did not and could not accept without first relaying the offer to Mr Logan. His argument is then that even if Mr Logan agreed, his acceptance of Mr Laszlo’s offer was never communicated to Mr Laszlo, and so no deal was struck.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It bears re-emphasising that this submission does not accord with Mr Laszlo’s testimony, which I have summarised above at [27] and rejected at [30]. After the conversation, there is no evidence that Mr Laszlo after the telephone conversation was waiting to hear from Mr Tan or Mr Logan that his offer was accepted. While it is fine to make a legal submission based on the evidence of the opposing party as an alternative to making submissions based on the version put forward by one’s own client, it is problematic to put forward a version of facts that differs from one’s own client’s testimony and which is not the opposing party’s testimony either. Mr Laszlo’s counsel’s submissions strayed at times into the latter. Specifically, Mr Laszlo did not claim that he made an offer for mutual forbearance, let alone one in respect of which he was expecting a further response from Mr Logan by way of acceptance or rejection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I accept Mr Tan’s evidence that an agreement was concluded on the telephone call, with Mr Tan saying words to the effect “Yes, okay, you want to settle, it is settled as you say, I will bring it to [Mr Logan]”.

</div> This is what he captured in his attendance note when he wrote that he would relay whatever Mr Laszlo told him to Mr Logan and take instructions from there. Mr Tan did not say that he needed to take his client’s instructions and come back to Mr Laszlo before there was a concluded compromise. In my view, Mr Tan, as a careful solicitor, would have expressly reserved his client’s position or said something to the effect that there was no agreement until he came back to Mr Laszlo if that had been his intention. Instead, Mr Tan ended the telephone conversation believing he had served his client’s interest by settling the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 A solicitor retained in litigation has implied authority to bind his client to a settlement of the suit. This gives rise to an ostensible authority to compromise the suit that may be relied upon by the opposing party unless he has been notified of some restriction or limitation on that authority. While there was no litigation filed at the time of the telephone call, it had been vigorously threatened by both parties. More importantly, Mr Logan had made clear to Mr Laszlo that he had engaged Mr Tan and that Mr Laszlo (or his lawyer) should deal with Mr Tan and not with Mr Logan directly. This was reflected in Mr Logan’s email to Mr Tan, dated 17 December 2014 at 12.41pm, and copied to Mr Laszlo.

</div> That Mr Logan accepted that everything was settled is supported by the fact that he did not instruct Mr Tan to take further action. This is sufficient to amount to his ratifying the compromise agreement, if there was any doubt about Mr Tan’s authority to accept Mr Laszlo’s offer on the call.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Moreover, I find that Mr Laszlo believed that the matter was resolved once and for all as a result of the telephone conversation he had with Mr Tan, and was happy with that outcome. He did not think that he needed to check further with Mr Tan and proceeded to act on the compromise agreement by getting on with his life without suing or threatening to sue. If Mr Laszlo had been waiting for a response from Mr Tan after Mr Tan had taken instructions from Mr Logan, he would have sent a chaser by email, but he never did so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It also follows from the fact (which I have found) that Mr Laszlo did not expect nor give any indication of requiring a response from Mr Logan following the call that this is a case where the offeror did not require any notice of acceptance other than performance by the offeree of his side of the bargain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This is an application of the principle expressed in <span class="font-italic">Carlill </span><span class="font-italic">v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company</span> [1893] 1 QB 256 (“<span class="font-italic">Carlill</span>”). In that famous case, the purveyors of a purported remedy for influenza placed advertisements offering money to any person who contracted influenza after having used one of their smoke balls in a specified manner for a stipulated period. Persuaded by the advertisements, Mrs Carlill duly purchased a smoke ball, and despite using it as directed, suffered an attack of influenza. She sued for the money and succeeded. One of the arguments taken against her was that she had never accepted Carbolic’s offer and so there was no binding contract. The English Court of Appeal rejected this argument, on the basis that the offeror had impliedly indicated that it did not require notice of acceptance other than performance of the condition. In Lindley LJ’s words, at 262–263: “ … the true view, in a case of this kind, is that the person who makes the offer shews by his language and from the nature of the transaction that he does not expect and does not require notice of the acceptance apart from notice of the performance.” In coming to the same conclusion, Bowen LJ, at 268, in a passage subsequently referred to with approval by the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">New Zealand Shipping</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd v A M Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd</span> [1975] AC 154, at 168, puts it in terms of an offer that ripens into a contract upon performance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In one respect, the facts in this case are more compelling than those in<span class="font-italic"> Carlill</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Carlill</span>, it might be said that the offeror had an interest in supervising performance and so might have preferred notification of acceptance prior to performance by Mrs Carlill, in case they wanted to check on her self-administration of their so-called remedy. Here, Mr Logan’s performance of the condition would be transparent to Mr Laszlo, in that Mr Laszlo obviously knew that Mr Logan did not proceed with the threatened suit against him, nor issue any further demands.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Certainly, both parties considered the dispute between them resolved as a result of the telephone conversation and acted on that understanding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Mr Logan made an alternative argument that Mr Laszlo is estopped from claiming the Skantek debt.

</div>
</div> In view of my conclusion that there was a compromise agreement, this argument is strictly moot but I nonetheless consider it and make some observations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The form of estoppel relied on was estoppel by convention. Its minimum requirements have been described by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Telecommunications Ltd v Starhub Cable Vision Ltd</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 195, at [28], as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The parties to a transaction act on an assumed state of facts or law;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The assumption is either one which both parties share or one which is made by one party and acquiesced in by the other; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In the case of a shared assumption, there is either an “agreement or something very close to it” in respect of the assumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If these requirements are satisfied, the parties are bound by the truth of that assumption if it would be unjust or unconscionable for either of them to go back on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this matter, at the time of the telephone conversation, Mr Laszlo and Mr Logan were already parties to a transaction, namely the purchase of the Skantek shares. This distinguishes this case from any attempt to bypass the principles of offer and acceptance. It would not ordinarily be possible to analyse contract formation in terms of estoppel, if the requirements of contract formation were not met. Here, however, estoppel by convention is relied on in relation to what the parties’ position was in relation to an existing contractual relationship between them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The genesis of the estoppel is Mr Laszlo’s representation in relation to the Skantek transaction that he had no claims against Mr Logan and Mr Logan should have no claims against him either. Mr Logan held the same view and both of them acted on that shared assumption  by not filing suit and allowing substantial time to pass. I accept that both parties assumed and believed that the matter was settled following from and as a result of that telephone conversation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Something changed three years later, after Mr Laszlo got to know Dr Vas. I draw the inference that he saw an opportunity to go into business combining his information technology experience and Dr Vas’s experience in radiology. I pause to note here that while Dr Vas has experience in radiology, he is not a medical specialist in radiology. The two of them subsequently set up Claritas Healthtech Pte Ltd in March 2020.

</div> I find that Mr Laszlo’s purported assignment of the Skantek debt to Dr Vas was opportunistic, preying on Dr Vas’s desperation when cornered by Mr Logan. He did so also as a way of hurting Mr Logan, against whom he continued to harbour resentment. He knew that he was reneging on what he had said to Mr Tan as Mr Logan’s lawyer three years’ previously. With the passage of time, the loss of documentary evidence and the fading of memories make it harder to prosecute or defend a suit. This was a detriment that flowed from parties’ acting on their shared assumption. I hold that it would be unjust and unconscionable for Mr Laszlo to go back on it now.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I therefore also accept that an estoppel by convention operates against Mr Laszlo.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: If there was no compromise of the Skantek debt, did Mr Laszlo induce Mr Logan into purchasing Skantek by fraudulent misrepresentation? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51   As I have held that there was a compromise of the Skantek debt, alternatively that an estoppel by convention operates, this issue is strictly moot. Nonetheless, I consider it briefly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52   The contract for the sale of the Skantek shares was made orally. As the shares were in the second defendant’s name, there was no need to transfer them. The second defendant simply held the shares on trust for Mr Logan instead of for Mr Laszlo. Mr Laszlo’s evidence is that the price of US$4,000,000 was arrived at by reference to a previous transaction where a company known as Bakel AB had apparently paid about US$2,370,000 to purchase about 30% of ICE Corporation, whose messaging business had been subsequently “spun off” into various entities collectively referred to as the ICE Group.

Mr Logan relied on those representations in agreeing to the price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 My finding is further supported by the fact that, as reflected in the Central Chambers Attendance Note, when Mr Tan raised the question of misrepresentation on the telephone call, Mr Laszlo did not deny saying things about a contract with TATA but instead claimed that he believed what he had told Mr Logan.

</div>
</div> Thus, as of 15 January 2018, there was only Mr Laszlo’s email dated 14 January 2018 to Dr Vas. I do not accept that this email fulfilled the statutory requirement. This is because it is worded vaguely without specifying that he was thereby transferring or assigning any specific debt to Dr Vas, even when read together with the forwarded email below it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There is a further point to consider if this email is to be accepted as constituting an assignment within the statute. That point is whether it was “under his hand.” That phrase refers to the appending of a signature. A signature need not be handwritten. It can be typed. Further, s 8 of the Electronic Transactions Act (Cap 88, 2011 Rev Ed) provides that the requirement of a signature may be satisfied if a method is used to identify the signatory and indicate his intention, so long as that method is either reliable in general or proven to have fulfilled the functions of a signature. Turning to this particular email, the only identification of him is his nickname Thomas which appears both within the email address and as the generic label for the email address. Mr Laszlo could have typed in his name below the message but did not do so. Labelling one’s email address with one’s name was considered sufficient for the purpose of s 6(d) of the Civil Law Act by Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">SM Integrated Transware Pte Ltd v Schenker Singapore (Pte) Ltd</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 651 at [91]-[93]. Her views were approved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Joseph Mathew and another v Singh Chiranjeev and another</span> [2010] 1 SLR 338 at [39]-[40].  The underlying principle is that the requirement of a signature can be satisfied in substance by some reliable indication of it, which was present in that case. Here however the generic label that Mr Laszlo adopted for his email address was not his legal name or any part of it. I am of the view that in the context of this case that generic label did not of itself provide a sufficiently objective indication of Mr Laszlo’s intention to apply his signature to a legal assignment. I consider also that there is a difference between the purpose of the signature requirement for contracts under Civil Law Act s 6 and the signature requirement for assignments under Civil Law Act s 4(8). In the former case, it principally protects the signatory against unfounded claims that there has been an oral contract. Ordinarily, if the obligor adopts the document as having been made by him that suffices. In the case of a legal assignment, however, the signatory requirement is as much for the protection of the debtor, who has an interest in knowing if his debt has been statutorily assigned by his creditor so that henceforward he deals with the assignee. Indeed, this case illustrates the importance of protection for the debtor, because Mr Laszlo had once before falsely claimed to Mr Logan that he had sold the Skantek debt, as I have found at [54] above, and in the same email relied on as the legal assignment falsely said that Dr Vas had paid him US$3 million.         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Thus, at the time when notice of assignment is said to have been given, namely on 15 January 2018 by Dr Vas’s email to Mr Logan, no assignment in writing under the assignor’s hand had yet taken place. Accordingly, the pleaded case

Prior to Mr Laszlo’s email, there appears to have been some conversation between Dr Vas and Mr Laszlo by which the assignment was made and communicated. It was after this conversation that Mr Laszlo provided Dr Vas with evidence of Mr Logan’s debt by his email of 14 January 2018. I infer that there was a conversation prior to that email which constituted the equitable assignment. Accordingly, I accept that Mr Laszlo did assign in equity the Skantek debt (if it existed) on or about 14 January 2018, and that Dr Vas notified Mr Logan of the assignment by his email of 15 January 2018.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: If the Skantek debt was validly assigned to Dr Vas, did he nonetheless waive it?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67   This issue is moot given my finding that the Skantek debt had been compromised.

In short, Dr Vas and Mr Logan agreed that Dr Vas could sell his 7,000 MyDoc shares to Mr Shervin (who also attended the meeting) so as to raise funds to pay Mr Logan and would have two months to do so. This was on the face of it a forbearance on Mr Logan’s part, because as of 13 January 2018, Mr Logan was pressing for repayment by 15 January 2018 as stipulated under the Logan Trust Deed. In addition, this agreement allowed Dr Vas to ensure that his MyDoc shares went to someone (Mr Shervin) with whom he was comfortable. Dr Vas had floated Mr Shervin as the incoming investor as early as October 2017.

</div> Otherwise, Mr Logan could have proceeded to require transfer of the MyDoc shares to him with his being free to sell to anyone. There was evidence that Dr Vas understandably wanted to limit to whom Mr Logan could sell. Given his interest in MyDoc, he wanted any new shareholder to be one of his own contacts. If the person was Mr Logan’s contact, that person should first be connected to him, presumably for him to become comfortable with that person.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 At the very least, Dr Vas was giving up his claim that he had set off his debt to Mr Logan against a debt owed by Mr Logan to Mr Laszlo. By doing so, he was obtaining the benefit of more time to make the sale to Mr Shervin happen before any enforcement of the Logan Trust Deed. This benefit was real, regardless of the effect and enforceability of the Logan Trust Deed which I consider in the next section. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 However, I am of the view that it goes beyond that. Dr Vas did not simply rescind or withdraw any purported exercise of set off, but gave up any future reliance on the purported assignment of the debt allegedly owed by Mr Logan to Mr Laszlo. Dr Vas said nothing about reserving that right, and had he done so, it is highly unlikely that Mr Logan, having called it “unacceptable” and a “scam”, would have been prepared to give him additional time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Thus, I hold that Dr Vas meant and was understood to mean that he would permanently shelve reliance on that purported assignment, and that this was done as part of an agreement giving him additional time to raise funds from sale of some of his MyDoc shares to Mr Shervin. While as I have noted at [13] above, Mr Logan did call upon Dr Vas to transfer the MyDoc shares to him this was in parallel to the possibility of Dr Vas’s raising funds by his own sale of MyDoc shares. I should add that I do not find that Mr Shervin was necessarily intended to be the ultimate beneficial owner. From a perusal of the entire WhatsApp correspondence, which stretches over months, it seems likely that Mr Shervin was intended to hold the shares on behalf of some other interests, whether from China or elsewhere, and it was from those other persons that the funds had to come. I do not need to make a finding either way for the purpose of my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5:  Is Dr Vas indebted to Mr Logan by virtue of the Logan Trust Deed, or his guarantee?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 To recap, Mr Logan’s counterclaim is for damages for breach of Dr Vas’s obligation under the Logan Trust Deed to transfer the 7,000 MyDoc shares, quantified by reference to the outstanding loan and any interest payable.
