<span lang="EN-GB">1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> This Originating Motion seeks the admission of Mr Nigel John Seed Queen’s Counsel (“QC”) as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore for the purpose of appearing as leading Counsel for the accused in PP v Joachim Kang Hock Chai.</span>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Headg-1" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>The Case for the Applicant and for the Accused</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The accused, Father Joachim Kang, is a Roman Catholic priest ordained in 1974. There are two main classifications of Roman Catholic priests – the diocesan or secular and the religious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Father Joachim Kang belongs to the class of diocesan or secular priests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Both classes of priests have the same powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A major difference between the two classes is that secular priests are not required to take the vow of poverty.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> Father Joachim Kang was appointed the parish priest of the Church of St. Teresa (with a congregation of around 2000) from 1989 until February 2002. He was then appointed the parish priest of the Church of the Holy Trinity (which has a congregation of some 8000).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> The 54 year old priest has been charged with 19 counts under section 409 Penal Code (criminal breach of trust of funds belonging to the Church of St. Teresa in his capacity as an agent of the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The 19 charges cover the period from 1994 to 2002 and involve a total of about $5.1 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The priest denies the charges and the trial in the Subordinate Courts is scheduled to begin on 22 September 2003.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> It was argued that the criminal case was particularly difficult and complex as it involved complicated transactions over a substantial period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The amounts in issue were large and were received and dealt with in different ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Accounting for and tracing them would therefore be a complicated exercise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There were also voluminous documents on the purchase and lease of two properties in Singapore, four in Malaysia and two in the United Kingdom, on numerous transactions in respect of four bank accounts in Singapore, four in Malaysia and one in the United Kingdom, on investments in unit trusts in Singapore<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> and Malaysia and on Father Joachim Kang’s shareholding<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> in many Singapore and Malaysian companies (many of which were given to him by his mother a long time ago).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In addition, there were documents pertaining to the bank accounts of the Church of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> St. Teresa, the construction works and the income and expenditure of the church, its accounting records and the renovation of the family home of the priest.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> The facts of the criminal trial would concern the decade-long relationship between the priest/confessor cum spiritual director and his parishioner/penitent (one Emily Chan) who gave large sums of money and substantial shares to him, to other Roman Catholic churches in Singapore and overseas and to various educational institutions recommended by the priest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In one of the statements made to the investigators, the priest said he invested Emily Chan’s donations in two properties and some unit trusts leaving the rest of the money in his bank accounts to earn interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He was entrusted with the donations to manage for the benefit of the archdiocese in Singapore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In two other such statements, he told the investigators that he believed he gave church funds to other churches and charities in response to their requests for donations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He also stated that he purchased two computers for two church helpers and paid an honorarium to another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He believed his actions were authorised under the Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> The criminal trial was said to be unique because of the ecclesiastical dimension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Father Joachim Kang had to abide by the Code of Canon Law 1983 promulgated by the Vatican (replacing the Code of 1917).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The priest’s duties were almost exclusively spiritual and his duties and activities were dictated not by contract but by conscience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His integrity was his life blood and it was this very integrity that would be called in question at the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> As the parish priest, he had authority, power, control and management in respect of the income and expenditure of the parish church. The income (from whatever source) was deposited into the church’s two bank accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Money was drawn from these two accounts for the church’s expenditure.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> The criminal case would involve an “in-depth consideration of the financial duties, responsibilities and authority of a Roman Catholic parish priest as well as his, and the parish’s, relationship to the Archbishop/Diocese and the accounting procedures of individual parishes and the Roman Catholic Church in Singapore as a whole”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This study would require an understanding of the Code of Canon Law 1983 and how it was interpreted and applied in Singapore and elsewhere as well as knowledge of ecclesiastical practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The priest’s defence lawyer would need to have this understanding and knowledge in order to question witnesses properly and to advance the case for the defence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> Novel and difficult issues of fact and of law would arise in the trial and there was no local case law or legal treatise on such matters. This was the first time a Roman Catholic priest was charged for criminal breach of trust in Singapore, Malaysia and the United Kingdom and the first time that the courts would be asked to consider the interplay of secular law and Canon law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No local counsel was capable of handling the Canon law dimension of the case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The prosecution would be calling an expert on Canon law and 52 other persons as witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> The priest may call 12 witnesses and a foreign expert on Canon law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The trial was estimated to last at least six weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The issues to be raised included the questions whether the priest was an agent of the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore as alleged in the charges and who the legal and beneficial owner of the income of the Church of St. Teresa was under Canon law and/or under secular law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The trial court would also have to consider whether the priest had the right to acquire, administer and alienate donations, to deposit such donations in his personal bank account and to invest such donations in properties, unit trusts and interest-bearing deposit accounts.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The case would be of concern to the Roman Catholic clergy and to the estimated 300,000 Catholics who donate to the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The prosecution in the criminal trial would be seeking to prove that Father Joachim Kang acted dishonestly when he transferred church funds to his personal bank accounts in Singapore and in Malaysia and used church funds to purchase two residential properties in Singapore, $100,000 worth of unit trust, two computers for parishioners and to make payments to two persons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The prosecution’s case would be that all these acts were carried out without the knowledge of the donor or of anyone in the Catholic Church’s hierarchy and were kept a secret.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> Most of the primary facts would not be in dispute and the main focus of the trial would be the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">mens rea</i> of the priest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was an issue of fact that could be gleaned from the circumstances of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Certain rules of the Catholic Church would be relevant but these would merely form the backdrop of the offences in question.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> In any case, issues of Canon law would be adequately addressed by the experts to be called by both parties and it was unclear how the expert court craft and experience of the QC in ecclesiastical matters would advance the case where interpretation of the Canon law was concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span> Any issue of agency could be resolved by looking to the Roman Catholic Archbishop Act (Chapter 375), the Universal Canon Law and the Priest’s Directory of 1995 (a manual produced by the Archdiocese of Singapore for its priests).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> Where the special qualifications of the QC were concerned, there was no evidence of any previous experience in the interpretation of Canon law relating to the scope of power of parish priests and their relationship with the Archdiocese or the manner in which church funds are to be administered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Local counsel would be equally competent to present the arguments on Canon law after studying it in consultation with the expert for the defence or even with the QC himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No evidence had been proffered on any steps taken to brief Senior Counsel on the case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> There was no “special reason” [section 21 (2) Legal Profession Act (“LPA”)] why a QC should be admitted for this case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There were no issues of constitutional law involved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was also no evidence that parish priests were greatly confused about the scope of their financial obligations and that clarification from the courts was therefore desirable.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">21.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The fact that the case would attract more attention than others was not a “special reason” to admit the QC.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">25.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> Where criminal cases are concerned, Parliament imposed an additional requirement on 1 January 1997 in the form of section 21(2) LPA which states that “the court shall not admit a person under this section in any criminal case unless the court is satisfied that there is a special reason to do so”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> In introducing this new provision, the Minister for Law made the following speech in Parliament on 10 October 1996 (see columns 633 and 634 of the Singapore Parliament Report Volume 66):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">“Let me turn to the admission of Queen’s Counsels in criminal cases. Sir, the provision relating to the admission of Queen’s Counsels was last amended in 1991 to add an additional condition for allowing them to appear in our courts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That condition is that the court must be satisfied that the case is of ‘sufficient difficulty and complexity’ to warrant a QC to be admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At that time in this House I had made it clear that the Government’s policy was that QCs should only be admitted for complex and difficult cases where the necessary knowledge or experience was not available from or could not be provided by local counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I also stressed then that the intention was to favour the admission of QCs particularly in banking and commercial cases.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The general policy of allowing QCs to appear in our courts remains unchanged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, there should be less need for QCs in criminal cases with the growth of the Criminal Bar in the last five years, not only in terms of numbers, but also in terms of advocacy skills, experience and expertise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Since 1991, only 10 QCs have been admitted to appear in criminal cases in Singapore and I am told that out of the nine cases dealt with by QCs, only two cases were successful. Presently, there are 89 criminal lawyers who are designated as senior counsel and 125 criminal lawyers who are designated as junior counsel for the purposes of the Assignment List of the High Court for capital cases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is no shortage therefore of criminal lawyers in the local Bar who have the confidence to undertake all criminal cases without having to rely on Queen’s Counsels.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">I should add that it is also important to note that our criminal process and criminal law are, except for basic principles, quite different from English criminal law and procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Our Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and Evidence Act are all based on Indian law and not on English criminal law and procedure and evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Many of our criminal statutes were enacted to meet local circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Queen’s Counsels, in general, are not familiar with our criminal justice system. ……</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> … I have given the above two examples in an effort to illustrate the sort of factors which may be treated by the courts as ‘special reasons’ under s 21(1A).

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">27.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> According to the Attorney General, in four other applications for the admission of QC in criminal matters heard since the introduction of section 21 (2) LPA, none has succeeded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They are Originating Motions 12 of 1997, 11 of 1998, 14 of 1998 and 7 of 2003.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">28.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The case against Father Joachim Kang is certainly not difficult or complex on the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Essentially, the issue at the trial will be, did he render to the church the things that belong to the church? The transactions in question were all documented and, as revealed in the priest’s statements made to the investigators exhibited in the affidavit supporting the application and as submitted before me, would not be challenged. The defence will be attempting to show that what the priest did was permissible under Canon law or some other applicable regulation and that the transactions were for the purposes of the church or that he made an honest mistake (where the payment in the 15<sup>th</sup> charge was concerned). Much has been written about the precepts of Canon law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Mr Peter Cuthbert Low produced two such works in court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> Pointing out the relevant Canon law or some other regulation should surely pose no problem to local counsel, especially since he will have the assistance of experts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Presumably, the priest himself would also be aware of the sources of the authority that he said allowed him to do what he did.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">29.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Wayne Kaskiw v Pornbacher</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">and others</i> [1997] 32 BCLR (3d) 360 (BCSC), a case concerning sexual assault by a priest and involving the issue whether the Bishop of Nelson, Corporation Sole, was vicariously liable, Quijano J in the Supreme Court of British Columbia said:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">“This was a matter of more than average complexity, both in terms of the evidentiary issues and in terms of the legal issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is particularly so in light of the reliance by the defendant bishop on the Code of Canon Law.”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-3" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The learned judge then went on to award costs on a higher scale.</span></p>

The decision was in respect of an application by the Catholic Archdiocese to strike out certain claims and to strike out the Roman Catholic Church as a defendant on the ground that it was not a legal entity capable of being sued. R E Nation J in the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, in ruling that the issue whether the Church was an entity capable of being sued could not be determined at that early stage of the proceedings, said:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">“I am also satisfied by the argument presented that the identification of the ecclesiastical versus the legal structure of the Church is, factually and legally, an extremely complex matter.”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">31.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> In the present case, the issue of agency alleged in the charges would involve some legal research and arguments but could be resolved by reference to all applicable provisions and this task could be undertaken quite competently by local counsel who, as in any other case involving contractual or regulatory instruments, would have familiarised himself with those provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He would be assisted in this task by the expert witnesses for both parties and by very senior members of the local Catholic Church called by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In any case, it is for the prosecution to prove the agency asserted in the charges. The issue of law may be argued for the first time in our courts but it is not of such difficulty and complexity that place it beyond the ability of local counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">32.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> Passing comments were made that this case would involve Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore relating to freedom of religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I see no issue in this case relating to the right of th</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: both">e</span> <span lang="EN-GB">priest to profess, practise and propagate his religion [Article 15(1)] and neither is there any challenge to the right of the Catholic Church to manage its own religious affairs, to establish and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes and to acquire and own property and hold and administer it in accordance with law [Article 15(3)].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">33.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> The circumstances of the case must show a “special reason” for admission. I accept that the criminal trial will probably attract more than a fair bit of attention among the Catholic clergy and laity as well as non-Catholics locally and probably outside Singapore as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is also true that the integrity of the priest will be tested publicly. However, these factors by themselves do not persuade me that the circumstances of the case warrant the admission of QC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There are many competent local lawyers, whether Catholic or not, who would be able to give the case the serious attention it deserves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These factors fall short of being “special reasons” for admission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is also no evidence that Catholic priests are in confusion as to what they can or cannot do with church funds and that this case will therefore have repercussions beyond the facts circumscribing it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">34.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> It was also argued that the priest should be “allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice” [Article 9(3) of the Constitution]. However, under this provision, the QC chosen must not only be willing and able to act for the defence, he must also be properly admitted under the LPA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Section 21 LPA is not a mere formality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It enjoins the court to consider the various matters set out in sub-sections (1) and (2).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is certainly not the law that the court <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">must</i> admit any QC chosen by the defence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">35.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> For the third stage test, I accept that Mr Nigel John Seed QC satisfies the requirement of having “special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case” in view of his vast experience in the areas of secular and spiritual law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, as indicated above, the case does not warrant his admission.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">36.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">      </span> It follows from the above discussion that the application must fail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I therefore dismissed the application to admit the QC.</span></p>
