<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 20 October 2011, I
                    dismissed the claim of Jane Rebecca Ong (“the
                    plaintiff”) and awarded judgment to
                    PricewaterhouseCoopers (“the first
                    defendant”), and Arul Chew &amp; Partners
                    (“the third defendant”) on their respective
                    counterclaims when the plaintiff, despite my urging, refused
                    to continue with the trial for this suit. I further
                    dismissed the plaintiff’s action against
                    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“the second
                    defendant”). The plaintiff has appealed against my
                    decision in Civil Appeal No 140 of 2011 (“the first
                    appeal”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This suit was another
                    episode in the litigation saga that Jane Rebecca Ong
                    (“the plaintiff”) first commenced twenty one
                    years ago in Originating Summons No 939 of 1991 (“the
                    OS”) when she sued Lim Lie Hoa (“Mdm
                    Lim”) her then mother-in-law and her then estranged
                    husband Ong Siauw Tjoan (“ST Ong”) for
                    one-twelfth share in the estate of Mdm Lim’s husband
                    Ong Seng King (“the deceased”). The deceased
                    was a very wealthy Indonesian who had died intestate on
                    22 October 1974 leaving substantial assets in numerous
                    countries including Singapore; ST Ong was/is a beneficiary
                    of the deceased’s estate (“the
                    estate”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The OS was converted to a
                    writ of summons pursuant to an order of court dated
                    4 April 1994. The plaintiff’s claim was based on
                    a deed of assignment dated 29 August 1991 (“the
                    deed of assignment”) whereby ST Ong assigned to her
                    half of his one-sixth share in the estate. Earlier, ST Ong
                    had executed a deed of release dated 29 June 1989
                    (“the deed of release”) acknowledging that he
                    had received £1,018,000 and US$150,000 in full and
                    final settlement of his interest in the
                estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff, as a litigant
                    in person in the OS emerged victorious when on 16 July
                    1996, Justice Chao Hick Tin (“Chao J”) ruled
                    in her favour (see <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim
                        Lie Hoa and Another</em> [1996] SGHC 140) and held
                        <em>inter alia</em> that: (i) the
                    deed of release executed by ST Ong was void and
                    unenforceable; (ii) the deed of assignment was valid and the
                    plaintiff was entitled to one-twelfth share of the estate.
                    Chao J ordered that an inquiry be held to determine ST
                    Ong’s one-sixth entitlement to the estate as of
                    29 August 1991 and the quantum of the plaintiff’s
                    one-twelfth share under the deed of assignment. Mdm Lim
                    appealed against Chao J’s decision. Her appeal was
                    heard by the Court of Appeal in February 1997 and dismissed
                    on 16 April 1997 (see <em>Lim Lie Hoa
                        and Another v Ong Jane Rebecca</em> [1997] 1
                    SLR(R) 775).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       I should point out that the
                    OS spawned subsequent proceedings by the parties which
                    resulted in five other judgments that were reported at: (i)
                    [2002] 1 SLR(R) 798; (ii) [2002] 2 SLR(R) 1078; (iii) [2003]
                    1 SLR(R) 457; (iv) [2004] 4 SLR(R) 301; (v) [2008] 3 SLR(R)
                    189; and (vi) [2009] 2 SLR(R) 798. The court files reveal
                    that the plaintiff was/is a party to sixteen bills of costs,
                    nine civil appeals, five suits and was a caveator in CAVP
                    No. 175 of 2010 in the estate of Mdm Lim (who passed away on
                    8 August 2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The inquiry ordered by
                    Chao J commenced in October 2002 and was held over 23
                    days before Assistant Registrar Phang Hsiao Chung
                    (“AR Phang”). At the conclusion, AR Phang in
                    his (185 page) judgment delivered on 13 June 2003
                    assessed (on a standard and not wilful default basis against
                    Mdm Lim as the plaintiff contended should have been the
                    case) the net values of the estate in the following
                    countries were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Singapore –
                        S$11,872,574.21</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Hong Kong – HK$18,686,098.75,
                        NZ$451,935.37 and £1,430.34</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     Malaysia –
                        S$485,528</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     Indonesia –
                    S$3,616,667</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     Europe – US$2,127,530.28,
                        DM2,708,472.40 and £331,043.46</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The total value of the estate was in the region of S$27.9m.
                    Consequentially, AR Phang awarded final judgment to the
                    plaintiff in the sum of $2,321,770.27 (“the judgment
                    sum”) plus interest together with one-twelfth share
                    in a piece of land and a plantation in Indonesia as well as
                    monies in a bank account in the United States. Setting off
                    the judgment sum against periodic interim payments which the
                    plaintiff had received between May 1998 and April 2001
                    pursuant to various orders of court she had obtained, the
                    net sum due to the plaintiff was only $37,493.67. In a
                    separate subsequent judgement, AR Phang awarded costs of the
                    inquiry to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mdm Lim, ST Ong, the
                    plaintiff as well as ST Ong’s two siblings (who had
                    been joined as the third and fourth defendants to the OS
                    because they were interested parties as beneficiaries of the
                    estate) appealed against AR Phang’s decision, first to
                    a judge in chambers (Justice Choo Han Teck (“Choo
                    J”)) who dismissed their appeals (at [2004] SGHC 131)
                    and then to the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff’s
                    appeal was in Civil Appeal No 58 of 2004. All the appeals
                    were dismissed on 19 January 2005 (see <em>Lim Lie Hoa and Another v Ong Jane
                        Rebecca</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 116) (“the CA
                    decision”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I should point out that the
                    plaintiff went into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement
                    (“IVA”) with her creditors in the UK in April
                    2005 when she was unable to pay her debts. I should also add
                    that throughout her years of litigation including the
                    present proceedings, the plaintiff appeared to have received
                    third party funding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The CA decision was the
                    genesis of this suit. On 20 March 2006, the plaintiff
                    commenced this suit against the three defendants for
                    professional negligence in acting for her as her experts
                    (the first and second defendants) and legal adviser
                    respectively (the third defendant) in the inquiry. Excluding
                    the two annexures and the reliefs she claimed, the
                    plaintiff’s statement of claim (Amendment No 1) filed
                    on 27 January 2010 totalled 229 pages and exceeded 182
                    paragraphs. The plaintiff apparently did nothing after
                    filing the writ which (after renewal) was only served more
                    than a year later in May 2007, after the plaintiff was
                    directed to do so by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The first defendant is the
                    Singapore office of PricewaterhouseCoopers which is
                    considered one of “the big four” international
                    accounting firms. The second defendant is the London office
                    of PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The third defendant was/is
                    a firm of advocates and solicitors whose partner and
                    subsequent sole-proprietor (from 1 January 2001) was
                    one Andre Arul (“Arul”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff approached
                    the second defendant with a view to engaging it as her
                    expert witness in the inquiry. After a discussion with the
                    plaintiff on 10 March 1999, Andrew Peter Clark
                    (“Clark”) a partner of the second defendant
                    felt it would be more appropriate for a partner of the first
                    defendant (as it was based in Singapore) to be the
                    plaintiff’s expert witness. Accordingly, Clark
                    introduced the plaintiff to the first defendant’s
                    partner Chan Ket Teck (“Chan”) who has since
                    passed away (in late 2008). The first defendant was
                    instructed to value the plaintiff’s one-twelfth
                    entitlement to the estate and to evaluate the accounts
                    pertaining to the assets of the estate when they were
                    prepared pursuant to Chao J’s judgment. Mdm Lim
                    engaged the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen
                    (“AA”) to prepare the accounts of the
                    estate’s assets. AA in two reports valued the estate
                    in the region of S$26m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff engaged the
                    first defendant’s services in or about April 1999. The
                    first defendant produced an interim report dated
                    21 March 2000 (“the PWC report”) pursuant
                    to the plaintiff’s instructions. The PWC report valued
                    the estate in the region of S$263.5m and it was used at the
                    inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff’s
                    complaint in her statement of claim in essence was that the
                    defendants had failed to advise her that the scope of the
                    inquiry ordered by Chao J pursuant to the judgment dated
                    16 July 1996 did not allow her to recover damages for
                    breaches of trust committed by Mdm Lim. However, the PWC
                    report was prepared on the basis that there were breaches of
                    trust committed by Mdm Lim. The plaintiff <em>inter alia</em> also alleged that AR Phang found
                    the PWC report unreliable and she was portrayed as a greedy
                    woman. She blamed the first defendant for neither putting
                    before AR Phang the requisite information and documents nor
                    relying on all the documents and evidence she presented,
                    resulting in an undervaluation by the court of the estate as
                    being worth $27,861.242 when the estate was actually worth
                    at least $309,265,348.12.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As for the third
                    defendant, the plaintiff alleged that Arul was negligent in
                    failing to bring to her attention that her case was not
                    properly pleaded in the OS, amend her pleadings and to give
                    her proper legal advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In their respective
                    defences, the three defendants denied the plaintiff’s
                    allegations. The second defendant denied it had acted for
                    the plaintiff at all. The first defendant counterclaimed
                    against the plaintiff for its professional fees in the sum
                    of $569,865.76 for the services it rendered for the inquiry.
                    The third defendant similarly counterclaimed the sum of
                    $329,809.27 for professional fees and disbursements incurred
                    in acting for the plaintiff between the period
                    27 December 1996 and 3 March 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The events leading up to the trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Since commencement of
                    these proceedings and until this court’s dismissal of
                    her action on 20 October 2011, the plaintiff has
                    appointed no less than three firms of solicitors to
                    represent her at various times. She had also acted in person
                    at various stages. One firm in particular, Engelin Teh
                    Practice LLC (“ETP”) was appointed twice,
                    first on 24 June 2009 and then reappointed on
                    4 August 2011. The plaintiff acted in person in the
                    periods 1 December 2008 to 23 June 2009,
                    10 May to 3 August 2011 and from 29 September
                    2011 onward after ETP ceased acting for her when the firm
                    failed (first before Justice Woo Bih Li (“Woo
                    J”)) and then before the Court of Appeal) to vacate
                    the original trial dates fixed between 26 September and
                    21 October 2011 (“the trial dates”). It
                    is pertinent to note that trial dates were first given in
                    July 2009 but those dates were vacated with costs ordered
                    against the plaintiff. Apparently the vacation was due to
                    the plaintiff’s indication to the court below at a
                    pre-trial conference held on 19 June 2009, that she
                    intended to amend her statement of claim, which she did much
                    later (in January 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Although Woo J did not
                    allow the trial dates to be vacated, he had nevertheless (by
                    his order of court dated 2 September 2011) pushed back
                    the start of trial by one week so that it would commence on
                    Monday, 3 October 2011 instead of on 26 September
                    2011. Similarly, although the Court of Appeal dismissed (on
                    21 September 2011) the plaintiff’s expedited
                    appeal (in Civil Appeal No 109 of 2011) against Woo
                    J’s decision, it ordered that the trial dates be
                    pushed further back. Instead of commencing on 3 October
                    2011, the trial was pushed back another week to start on
                    10 October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Trial in fact did not
                    commence on Monday 10 October 2011 but on
                    13 October 2011 as I was on leave before that. On
                    Tuesday 12 October 2011, the parties appeared in my
                    chambers for the urgent hearing of Summons No 4491 of 2011
                    (“the plaintiff’s application”) which I
                    granted. The plaintiff had applied for extensions of time
                    to: file her objections to the Affidavits of
                    Evidence-in-Chief (“the AEICs”) of the
                    defendants, file her core bundle of documents and the
                    opening statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Previously, the second
                    defendant had in Summons No 4471 of 2011 (“the second
                    defendant’s application”) filed on
                    6 October 2011, applied for the evidence of Clark to be
                    given by way of videolink from London. The second
                    defendant’s application (which was supported by
                    Clark’s affidavit) was granted on 10 October 2011
                    by the court below with the consent of the third defendant
                    and the plaintiff. The plaintiff was absent but counsel for
                    the first/second defendant mentioned the matter on her
                    behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After settling various
                    housekeeping issues including the voluminous bundles that
                    were produced in court (numbering 90 odd volumes from the
                    plaintiff and the defendants), the trial commenced with the
                    plaintiff taking the stand. She was assisted by a company
                    called Litigation Edge Pte Ltd (“Litigation
                    Edge”) whose function, through its two
                    representatives in court (Serena Lim and Chen Junbin), was
                    to assist the plaintiff to bring up for viewing via the
                    mobile infotech trolley, documents that the plaintiff and/or
                    counsel referred to in the course of her
                testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff was
                    cross-examined by counsel for the first/second defendants Mr
                    Ang Cheng Hock (“Mr Ang”) followed by counsel
                    for the third defendant Mr Chandra Mohan (“Mr
                    Mohan”). The plaintiff’s cross-examination did
                    not conclude until the afternoon of Tuesday 18 October
                    2011. Effectively, the plaintiff was in the witness stand
                    for about five days. The plaintiff’s second witness
                    was her son Nicholas Ong whose examination and
                    cross-examination were brief and was concluded when this
                    court rose on the evening of 18 October 2011. Hearing
                    did not resume on Wednesday, 19 October 2011 when the
                    plaintiff would have been re-examined as she had informed
                    the court on Tuesday that she needed more time to review the
                    transcripts of her testimony which were being produced on a
                    daily basis. The court acceded to her request and adjourned
                    the hearing to Thursday 20 October 2011
                morning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the morning of
                    20 October 2011, the plaintiff requested to see me in
                    chambers which request I acceded to. The plaintiff
                    complained that she had just received that morning at 9.30am
                    Mr Ang’s letter dated 19 October 2011 giving
                    his order of witnesses; it stated that Clark would be the
                    first witness (on the second defendant’s behalf)
                    followed by three witnesses for the first defendant. The
                    plaintiff claimed she was not aware until then that the
                    second defendant’s witness would be called first
                    instead of those for the first defendant. The plaintiff then
                    went into the history of how she came to act in person
                    (after ETP ceased acting for her) and indicated she could
                    not continue with the trial because of her late receipt of
                    the first/second defendants’ list of
                witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Quite apart from the fact
                    that it was the prerogative of their counsel Mr Ang as to
                    which of his witnesses he chose to call first since he acted
                    for both the first and the second defendants, the court
                    pointed out that the plaintiff had known (from the second
                    defendant’s application in [20]) that Clark’s
                    testimony was to be taken by videolink). Mr Ang added
                    that when the second defendant applied for videolink of
                    Clark’s testimony, it was on the basis of the trial
                    dates before Woo J pushed them back to 3 October 2011.
                    His witnesses had reserved their availability based on the
                    trial dates. Mr Ang reminded the court that at the
                    hearing of the plaintiff’s application (on
                    12 October 2011), he had indicated that he had booked
                    the Technology Court for 20 October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Ang explained that
                    Clark was scheduled to testify on 20 October 2011 as
                    Clark’s time was fully booked on other dates for
                    matters he was involved in (which were stated in
                    Clark’s supporting affidavit for the second
                    defendant’s application). Mr Ang did not
                    understand how the plaintiff could be taken by surprise as
                    he had on the first day of trial (13 October 2011 at
                    Notes of Evidence (“NE”) 16) again said that
                    Clark’s evidence by videolink would take place on
                    20 October 2011. Mr Ang added that his accounting
                    expert was Trevor John Dick (“Dick”) from
                    Ernst &amp; Young’s Hong Kong office, while Ian Edward
                    Huskisson an English solicitor, was to testify on the
                    plaintiff’s IVA in the UK (see [8]). All his witnesses had
                    blocked the dates in their diaries based on the trial dates
                    commencing on 26 September 2011; the dates had since
                    been shifted. Instead of making his witnesses wait even
                    longer, they should be allowed to testify.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The court informed the
                    plaintiff that Clark would testify that afternoon as
                    scheduled. The plaintiff then inquired whether she could
                    recall Clark after she had cross-examined the first
                    defendant’s witness Chan Kheng Tek
                    (“CKT”). She explained that the questions she
                    would put to CKT may need input from Clark. I assured the
                    plaintiff that Clark could be recalled although she
                        <em>may</em> have to pay the costs
                    of doing so. If need be, Dick too could be recalled either
                    in person or by videolink after he had testified.
                    Mr Ang also offered to cross-examine the
                    plaintiff’s accounting expert Owain Rhys Stone
                    (“Stone”) first before Clark testified and
                    before the plaintiff was re-examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Notwithstanding what the
                    court and counsel said, the plaintiff maintained she did not
                    feel capable or emotionally capable of continuing, adding
                    that she had been told that if at any time she could not
                    carry on, she must inform the court. She felt she had no
                    choice. The plaintiff said she did not want to waste the
                    court’s time and continue with the
                trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I made it clear to the
                    plaintiff that if she failed to continue with the trial, I
                    would be left with no alternative but to dismiss her case
                    against the three defendants with costs. I suggested to the
                    plaintiff that her re-examination be postponed until after
                    she had had an opportunity to go through the notes of
                    evidence of the previous Thursday’s hearing (which
                    parties had just received that morning). In fact, counsel
                    agreed that the plaintiff need only do her own
                    re-examination after Clark had testified. Consequently, the
                    hearing in open court was stood down to 11.00am to enable
                    the plaintiff to refresh herself with Thursday’s notes
                    of evidence and also Clark’s AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Despite the above warning
                    and the efforts of the court as well as counsel to
                    accommodate her, when open court resumed at 11.08am, the
                    plaintiff was absent. Invited to speak, Serena Lim from
                    Litigation Edge informed me that the plaintiff had indeed
                    left the court’s premises and had told her that she
                    (the plaintiff) would not be returning to
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On hearing Serena Lim,
                    Messrs Ang and Mohan applied on behalf of their respective
                    clients to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim. In the case
                    of the first and third defendants, counsel also applied for
                    judgment on their clients’ counterclaims. I dismissed
                    the plaintiff’ claim and awarded judgment on the
                    counterclaims. In this regard, I should point out that when
                    the plaintiff was cross-examined, she did not dispute the
                    counterclaim of either the first or the third defendants.
                    Her main contention as stated in her reply and defence to
                    their respective counterclaims (apart from stating she was
                    not obliged to pay them because of their negligence) was,
                    that the two defendants had waived their rights and/or were
                    barred/stopped from making their claims because of the IVA
                    she had made with her creditors, and which she asserted
                    included the two defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As was pointed out by Mr
                    Ang, this court was <em>not</em>
                    precluded from awarding judgment on the counterclaims of the
                    first and third defendants merely because the plaintiff was
                    under an IVA with her UK creditors. The IVA would only
                    affect the issue of enforcement of the defendants’
                    judgments in the UK. (The formal judgment was extracted by
                    the first/second defendants on 20 October
                2011).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Although both counsel
                    asked for costs on an indemnity basis, I felt that it would
                    not be fair to award such costs to the three defendants
                    without affording the plaintiff an opportunity to present
                    her arguments. Consequently costs of the suit were reserved.
                    On the same day itself, the court wrote to the plaintiff
                    setting out the events of the morning, informing her of the
                    defendants’ request for indemnity costs and giving her
                    two weeks (until Thursday, 3 November 2011) to revert
                    with her objections if she disagreed that the defendants
                    should be awarded indemnity costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     By her letter dated
                    25 October 2011 (carbon-copied to the defendants’
                    solicitors), the plaintiff reverted voicing her objections
                    to indemnity instead of standard costs being awarded to
                    three defendants. It would not be necessary to address the
                    contents of the plaintiff’s letter save to point out
                    that counsel for the three defendants did not agree with the
                    contents generally. It was noteworthy that the
                    plaintiff’s letter showed she appreciated the
                    difference between the two types of costs. It was also
                    noteworthy that the plaintiff did not disagree with the
                    court’s narration of what took place in my chambers on
                    20 October 2011. Neither did she raise any of the
                    allegations found in the first affidavit that she filed for
                    the appeal application. Instead, the plaintiff concluded her
                    letter as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I offer my sincere apologies and regret as I did not
                        mean to act discourteous or disrespectful to Your Honour
                        by not returning to court. I just felt unable to regain
                        my composure enough to face the ordeal in such stressful
                        circumstances. I sincerely thank Your Honour for
                        allowing and inviting Ms Serena Lim of Litigation Edge
                        to address and inform the court on my behalf that I
                        would not be continuing with the trial. I am also
                        extremely grateful for giving me the opportunity to put
                        my objections to the Court on the request of the
                        Defendants for costs on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In view of her objections
                    to the award of indemnity costs to the defendants, the
                    Supreme Court Registry (“the Registry”)
                    informed the plaintiff by its letter dated 8 November
                    2011 that a hearing date would be fixed for the parties to
                    present arguments on costs in the first quarter of 2012 and
                    that the plaintiff should make herself available in
                    Singapore for that purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, no hearing date
                    for arguments on costs was fixed at all because subsequent
                    events overtook the issue and rendered a hearing date
                    unnecessary. First, the plaintiff appointed her present
                    solicitors Robert Wang &amp; Woo LLP (“RWW”)
                    on 18 November 2011. Second, on the same day, RWW filed
                    the first appeal [1]
                    on the plaintiff’s behalf. Third, on 3 January
                    2012 through RWW, the plaintiff applied in Summons No 9 of
                    2012 (“the appeal application”) to: (i) set
                    aside the judgment awarded to the defendants on
                    20 October 2011 and (ii) stay the first appeal. Fourth,
                    the defendants subsequently informed the court that they
                    would settle for costs on a standard basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The appeal application
                    (which was unanimously opposed by all three defendants), was
                    heard by this court on 21 February 2012 and dismissed.
                    On 20 March 2012, the plaintiff filed a second notice
                    of appeal in Civil Appeal No 25 of 2012 (“the
                    plaintiff’s second appeal”) against my
                    dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In relation to the fourth
                    reason in <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>, the
                    third and first/second defendants’ solicitors wrote on
                    7 March and 16 March 2012 respectively to inform
                    me that their clients had decided (notwithstanding their
                    entitlement to the same) not to pursue their claim for
                    indemnity costs. Instead, the defendants wished to proceed
                    to tax their costs on a standard basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Accordingly, and after the
                    Registry had confirmed to their solicitors that costs to all
                    three defendants were on a standard basis, the third
                    defendant extracted an order of court dated 9 March
                    2012 to that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   The plaintiff’s first
                appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I shall first set out the
                    reasons for this court’s dismissal of the
                    plaintiff’s claim and the consequential award of
                    judgment to the first and third defendants on their
                    respective counterclaims, before dealing with the appeal
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is not unreasonable to
                    conclude based on her litigation history set out at
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>, that the
                    plaintiff is undoubtedly a savvy/seasoned litigator
                    notwithstanding her denials to the contrary. That was how
                    the counsel for the defendants described her in these
                    proceedings and I agree it was an apt description. The
                    plaintiff acquitted herself admirably as a litigant in
                    person when she faced two senior lawyers (who represented
                    Mdm Lim and ST Ong) as her opponents in the OS; both lawyers
                    subsequently became senior counsel. However, there was
                    another side to the plaintiff’s character that
                    surfaced over the years she was embroiled in litigation; the
                    plaintiff repeatedly failed to comply with timelines whether
                    consensual or court-imposed, and with innumerable directions
                    made by the court. This was a frequent complaint by counsel
                    for the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In this regard, I would
                    refer to Woo J’s grounds of decision dated
                    14 September 2011 (at [2011] SGHC 203) when he refused
                    to allow her to vacate the trial dates. Woo J had this to
                    say at [119]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I concluded that JRO [the plaintiff] had abused her
                        position as a lay litigant and her need to obtain
                        funding for legal representation. There was no strong
                        reason to support the Present Summons. There was also a
                        history of failure by her to comply with timelines
                        agreed to by herself and/or imposed by the court. Her
                        explanations were also not <em>bona
                            fide</em>. In the circumstances, I declined to
                        vacate all the Present Trial Dates…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For the reasons set out below, I fully endorse Woo
                    J’s observation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     When she was in my
                    chambers on 20 October 2011, the plaintiff had alluded
                    (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>) to one of Woo
                    J’s orders made on 2 September 2011 when she
                    informed me that she had been told that she must inform the
                    court if at any time she could not carry on. However, the
                    plaintiff had only made selective reference to Woo J’s
                    order; the full text of prayer 8 of his order reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the plaintiff is of the view that it is pointless
                        for her to attempt to meet any of the above orders, she
                        or her solicitors are to notify the solicitors of all
                        the defendants immediately in writing, <em>whereupon her claim against each and every
                            Defendant is struck out and the plaintiff is to pay
                            the costs of her action to the Defendants to be
                            agreed or taxed</em>. (emphasis mine)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff had deliberately and wilfully
                    omitted to refer to the italicised portion of Woo J’s
                    order. She well knew the consequences of her action –
                    that if she did <em>not</em> resume the
                    trial but chose to walk out of my court, (despite my and the
                    efforts of counsel to accommodate her on the order of
                    witnesses to be called), her claim would be dismissed. She
                    made a deliberate and conscious decision to abandon her
                    case. Yet the plaintiff came back later by way of the appeal
                    application and requested me to overlook/ignore her earlier
                    decision. The plaintiff’s ambivalent stand was not
                    only unreasonable but totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It should be noted that
                    prior to his letter dated 19 October 2011, Mr Ang
                    had <em>not</em>, indeed he had
                        <em>never</em>, given any
                    indication to the plaintiff (nor did she ask) of the order
                    of his witnesses. It was Mr Ang (and Mr Mohan) who had
                    requested the plaintiff for her order of witnesses. That
                    being the case, how could the plaintiff say that Mr Ang
                    had changed his order of witnesses? In any case, as Mr Ang
                    acted for both the first and second defendants, it was
                    entirely within his prerogative to decide whether he would
                    put the first or second defendants’ witness on the
                    stand first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In her first affidavit
                    filed on 3 January 2012 (para 58) in support of the
                    appeal application (at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>), the plaintiff had alleged that the
                    order of court dated 2 September 2011 (made by
                    Woo J (at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>) set
                    out the order of witnesses to be called by the first and
                    second defendants. That is incorrect. That order of court
                    merely <em>identified</em> the factual
                    and expert witnesses the parties intended to call, not the
                    order in which they would be called. Even if it did, the
                    order was not cast in stone. Counsel for the two defendants
                    was entitled to change his order of witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I would add that the
                    plaintiff’s contention (in para 98 of her first
                    affidavit) that I should have granted her at least one
                    day’s adjournment to prepare her cross-examination of
                    the first defendant’s expert witnesses was <em>not</em> raised on 20 October 2011
                    or in her subsequent letter dated 25 October 2011 at
                        [33]. Had she
                    done so, her request would have been favourably considered,
                    she being the party bearing the hearing fees not the
                    defendants. It was in any case unlikely that the first
                    defendant’s experts would have testified on
                    20 October 2011 in view of the fact that Clark was
                    scheduled to testify via video-link that afternoon. I had
                    informed the plaintiff that she would be given time to
                    refresh herself with Clark’s AEIC and I stood down the
                    hearing that morning for that reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is telling that the
                    plaintiff had shifted her stand – on 20 October
                    2011, she told the court and counsel she could not carry on
                    with the <em>trial</em>, she <em>did not</em> say that she was unable to
                    carry on for that day <em>only.</em>
                    If, as the plaintiff deposed in para 32 of her affidavit
                    dated 17 February 2012 (“the plaintiff’s
                    third affidavit”), that standing down the hearing to
                    11am was insufficient time for her to read 132 pages of the
                    notes of evidence of Thursday 13 October 2011 to
                    refresh herself for re-examination, this was not told to me
                    nor was I asked for more time (which I would have readily
                    granted). In any case, I had directed that her
                    re-examination would be postponed to a later date. The 20
                    days’ trial was scheduled to continue until Friday
                    4 November 2011 (unless it was concluded earlier or
                    later). The impression given by the plaintiff that morning
                    was <em>not</em> that she wanted a
                    short adjournment but that she did not intend to carry on
                    with the trial <em>at
                all</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Notwithstanding her
                    “extremely distressed and upset state”
                    (according to her letter dated 25 October 2011), the
                    plaintiff lost no time and had the presence of mind to write
                    to the Registry immediately after the morning to request the
                    refund of her hearing fees. Although her request was dated
                    21 October 2011, that date was obviously a mistake and
                    the letter must have been written on 20 October 2011.
                    This is clear from the following two paragraphs of her
                    letter where the plaintiff said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I refer to the court hearing in relation to the above
                        suit 156/2006W, which had been scheduled for the
                        following dates: 13<sup>th</sup> October
                        2011 to 4<sup>th</sup> November
                        2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the trial ended on the morning of 21 October
                        2011, I am writing to request for the unutilised court
                        hearing fees to be refunded to me and for the same to be
                        paid to “Litigation Edge Pte Ltd”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Her request for the hearing fees also belied the
                    plaintiff’s (current) contention that she only
                    intended to have a short adjournment of her case. She
                    attempted to explain her action (at para 26) in her third
                    affidavit (see [55])
                    by stating she needed the hearing fees to reimburse
                    Litigation Edge their disbursements; no figures were given
                    nor was any evidence produced; I remain highly sceptical of
                    the plaintiff’s explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Even if the
                    plaintiff’s complaint against Mr Ang’s
                    scheduling or rescheduling of witnesses had any merit, the
                    third defendant had no part to play in that complaint. The
                    plaintiff could have proceeded with her cross-examination of
                    Arul. Her case against him and his defence had no bearing on
                    her case against the other two defendants; she did
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It bears noting that this
                    suit commenced more than six years ago. Had the plaintiff
                    pursued her claim with reasonable diligence, the proceedings
                    from commencement of trial to the conclusion of the appeal
                    process should have taken no more than two to three years.
                    Even giving due allowance to the plaintiff’s
                    propensity to appeal against (almost) every interlocutory
                    application that was made against her (as seen from her past
                    litigation history), the trial should have taken place
                    before the demise of Chan in late 2008. As it is, because of
                    the plaintiff’s dilatory conduct, the first defendant
                    had suffered irreparable prejudice as Chan is no longer
                    available to answer the plaintiff’s many allegations
                    against the first defendant/him or to defend his conduct
                    generally and his preparation of the PWC report in
                    particular. In the case of the third defendant, he has had
                    this suit hanging over his head like the sword of Damocles
                    for the same amount of time. This is highly unsatisfactory
                    to a senior member of the Singapore Bar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It was very clear to me
                    that the plaintiff was looking for an excuse not to continue
                    with the trial. I would not wish to speculate on the
                    plaintiff’s reason for doing so although counsel for
                    the defendants seemed to think (on hindsight after she filed
                    her first affidavit in support of the appeal application)
                    that it was the plaintiff’s way of obtaining the
                    adjournment of the trial dates that she sought earlier but
                    which was denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As stated at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>, the plaintiff did not
                    seriously challenge the professional fees claimed by the
                    first and third defendants when she was cross-examined by
                    their counsel. Her excuse for not paying either claim was
                    that she could not because she lacked the funds and was
                    technically bankrupt being under IVA in the UK. In the
                    plaintiff’s reply and defence to counterclaims of the
                    two defendants, she had pleaded that the two defendants were
                    barred from making their claims as those debts were existing
                    at the date when her creditors approved the IVA; the quantum
                    was not in issue. The plaintiff contended that under cl 4(3)
                    of the standard conditions in her IVA, no creditor including
                    the defendants could commence or continue any claim against
                    her outside the IVA. She added that the two defendants were
                    bound by the IVA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It seemed to me that the
                    plaintiff’s defence did not preclude either the first
                    or the third defendants from obtaining judgment on their
                    respective counterclaims. Whether they could enforce the
                    judgments they obtained against the plaintiff in the UK is
                    another matter altogether and does not concern the Singapore
                    courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   The plaintiff’s second
                appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I move now to the
                    plaintiff’s second appeal. The appeal application was
                    as follows:</p>

                        first defendant and third defendants’ respective
                        counterclaims on 20 October 2011 pursuant to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In support of the appeal
                    application, the plaintiff filed three affidavits, the first
                    (comprising of 397 pages and 167 paragraphs of text) on
                    3 January 2012 (the plaintiff’s/her first
                    affidavit”); there she deposed to the entire genesis
                    of this suit. The plaintiff gave a very different version of
                    what transpired on 20 October 2011 in my chambers. Her
                    version was wholly/partly untrue or totally inaccurate
                    altogether. The first/second as well as the third defendants
                    filed one affidavit each by their counsel Ramesh Selvaraj
                    and Gillian Hauw respectively, to rebut the
                    plaintiff’s first affidavit. The plaintiff filed two
                    further affidavits in response, one on 15 February 2012
                    (“the plaintiff’s second affidavit”) and
                    by her third affidavit. As Messrs Ang and Mohan (with his
                    colleague) were present, they were/are the best persons to
                    verify the accuracy of the plaintiff’s version of what
                    transpired in my chambers on 20 October 2011; I need
                    say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In addition to giving a
                    distorted version of the chamber hearing on 20 October
                    2011, on the orders that I had made for preparation of
                    bundles of documents on 10 October 2011 and on
                    counsel’s conduct towards her, the plaintiff’s
                    first affidavit touched on ETP’s conduct of her case.
                    Some of her comments in that regard were critical of ETP not
                    to mention untrue, when seen in the light of ETP’s
                    responses (see <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>).
                    Contrary to Rule 71 of the Legal Profession
                    (Professional) Conduct Rules which states:</p>

                            witness, an allegation made against another advocate
                            and solicitor, shall give the other advocate and

                            filed and served.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">ETP was not served with a copy of the
                    plaintiff’s first affidavit and afforded an
                    opportunity to respond to the plaintiff’s allegations
                        <em>before</em> the hearing of the
                    appeal application. Instead, the court was told that it was
                    Mr Mohan who informed ETP of the plaintiff’s
                    allegations and the senior partner then contacted the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors; a copy of the
                    plaintiff’s first affidavit was later extended to
                    ETP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     At the commencement of the
                    hearing, counsel from RWW Mr Woo Tchi Chu
                    (“Mr Woo”) informed the court that ETP
                    had written two responses (dated 16 February 2012 and
                    17 February 2012) to the allegations made against ETP
                    in the plaintiff’s first affidavit. Mr Woo handed
                    copies thereof to the court. At the court’s direction,
                    a solicitor from RWW (Mr Ong Sing Huat) filed an
                    affidavit subsequently to exhibit ETP’s said
                    letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The plaintiff’s
                    first affidavit was telling in many respects. She had no
                    qualms about bending the truth when it suited her purpose,
                    even where (as in the case of the chamber hearing on
                    20 October 2011) counsel was present and could/did
                    rebut her version of what transpired. As stated in <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>, she made adverse
                    comments on ETP’s handling of her case without
                    affording the firm an opportunity to respond to her
                    allegations, until after Mr Mohan
                intervened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It spoke volumes that
                    ETP’s letter dated 16 February 2012 pointed out
                    that the trial dates and timelines for various matters to be
                    done were given at a pre-trial conference
                    (“PTC”) on 1 April 2011; ETP could have
                    complied with those directions and brought the action to
                    trial if not for the fact that the plaintiff (because of
                    lack of funding) had <em>suspended</em>
                    ETP’s work on 3 March 2011 and thereafter
                        <em>discharged</em> the firm on
                    10 May 2011. Notwithstanding the firm’s discharge
                    as her solicitors, ETP constantly reminded the plaintiff of
                    the timelines and directions made on 1 April 2011 which
                    PTC, as a favour to her, ETP attended even though they no
                    longer acted for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     When ETP was reappointed
                    as the plaintiff’s solicitors on 4 August 2011
                    (which was seven weeks before the trial was due to commence
                    on 26 September 2011), <em>the plaintiff
                        had still not complied with the directions made
                        </em><em>on </em><em>1 April 2011.</em> There was
                    insufficient time between 4 August 2011 and
                    26 September 2011 for ETP to comply with the order of
                    court dated 1 April 2011. This significant fact was
                    conveniently omitted from the plaintiff’s first
                    affidavit. In other words, the plaintiff’s conduct
                    (and/or that of her funders) caused ETP to be unable to be
                    ready for trial by 26 September 2011. Consequently, the
                    plaintiff’s comment in her letter to court dated
                    25 October 2011 (see [33]) that “I was left high and dry
                    and without legal representation just 2 weeks before the
                    trial commenced. No work had been done in preparation for
                    trial by former solicitors…” was an
                    unfair/unjust criticism of ETP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As for the lateness of her
                    application, the plaintiff explained <em>inter alia</em> in her first affidavit (at paras
                    103 to 111) that she needed time to find a new firm of
                    solicitors who were able/willing to represent her, she
                    needed approval from her funders, she had to fight attempts
                    by her brother-in-law Ong Siauw Ping to make her a bankrupt
                    in the UK following the dismissal of this suit and she spent
                    4-5 days in seclusion to recover after the traumatic
                    experience in my court on 20 October 2011 before she
                    pulled herself together, picked up the pieces and sought
                    legal advice. As I was aware of the plaintiff’s
                    conduct and previous litigation history, her excuses rang
                    hollow. At the risk of repetition, the plaintiff wasted no
                    time in applying for the refund of her unused hearing fees.
                    What was so difficult for her, a seasoned lay litigant, to
                    have filed a summons application for an extension of time to
                    appeal before she appointed RWW, if she needed more time to
                    collect her thoughts? Instead, she filed the first appeal.
                    In the past, the plaintiff was perfectly capable of filing
                    and had filed applications herself, judging by the
                    plaintiff’s application in <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     After counsel for the
                    defendants filed their affidavits to refute her first
                    affidavit, the plaintiff in her third affidavit sought
                        <em>inter alia</em> to explain away
                    her letter to court dated 25 October 2011 (where she
                    said Serena Lim had informed the court she would not be
                    continuing with the trial) by contending that her letter was
                    written without legal advice or assistance. The plaintiff
                    maintained she was unable to carry on with the trial on
                    20 October 2011 because of the first and second
                    defendant’s change in their order of witnesses. In the
                    light of my earlier observations in <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> and <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>, this excuse did not hold
                water.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     At the hearing of the
                    appeal application, Mr Woo asked a number of questions
                    including, why would the plaintiff go to the extent of
                    deliberately walking out on her own trial as counsel had
                    accused her of doing? What benefit did she gain by behaving
                    in the manner she did when she had everything to lose? He
                    argued it was because the plaintiff was emotionally
                    distraught and had suffered a “meltdown”.
                    Mr Woo also raised the issue of the defendants’
                    change of order of witnesses which he termed the
                    plaintiff’s “main bugbear”. He submitted
                    that the plaintiff’s conduct that day was not
                    contumelious or deliberate. Mr Woo pointed out that the
                    defendants would not be prejudiced in any way if the
                    plaintiff was allowed to continue with the trial from where
                    she left off. He argued that whatever prejudice suffered by
                    the defendants was compensable by costs. In the light of
                    Chan’s demise in 2008 and my comment in <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>, I rejected this
                    submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Various cases were cited
                    by Mr Woo in support of the appeal application
                    including <em>Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue
                        Chew</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 673
                        (“<em>Su
                    Sh-Hsyu</em>”) which I shall refer to
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Needless to say, the
                    appeal application was strenuously opposed by counsel.
                    Messrs Ang and Mohan raised the preliminary objection (which
                    I accepted) that the application was misconceived –
                    O 35 r 2 of the Rules (at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>) <em>did not</em>
                    apply to the plaintiff as hers was not a case where she
                    failed to turn up for the trial as stated under O 35
                    r 1(2); the trial was underway but the plaintiff
                    refused to continue notwithstanding being warned by the
                    court of the consequences of such a course of action.
                    Counsel disagreed with the plaintiff’s portrayal of
                    herself as a helpless lay litigant citing her past
                    litigation history. (I would add this included the
                    plaintiff’s ability to file objections to the contents
                    of the AEICs of the first/second defendants’ witnesses
                    of fact <em>viz</em> CKT and Clark on
                    the grounds of hearsay, opinion and speculation.). The
                    plaintiff’s excuse of being a lay litigant had worn
                    thin after 21 years as she had been found to have abused her
                    status time and again.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I turn at this juncture to
                    the case of <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em>
                        (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>). I accepted the
                    submission of counsel for the defendants that this case did
                    not help the plaintiff at all. There, the Court of Appeal
                    dealt with an application under O 35 r 2 of the
                    Rules by the defendant/appellant. Judgment had been entered
                    against her by the trial judge in her absence from court
                    after her solicitor failed to obtain an adjournment of the
                    trial dates. The appellate court also dealt with the issue
                    of additional evidence that the defendant wanted to adduce
                    which would prove that the
                    respondent’s/plaintiff’s signature on a banking
                    slip was his, to rebut the respondent’s contention
                    that he had never signed the document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The appellate court
                    allowed the defendant’s application to adduce
                    additional evidence because the evidence uncovered a
                    possible fraud being perpetrated by the respondent. The
                    appellate court in allowing the appeal (even though it held
                    the defendant’s conduct in not attending the trial was
                    deliberate) laid down (at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>) five criteria for the court’s
                    exercise of its discretion in such cases as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     Prejudice
                        – whether the successful party would be prejudiced
                        by the judgment being set aside, especially if the
                        prejudice was irremediable by an order for
                    costs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     Applicant’s delay –
                        whether there was any undue delay by the absent party in
                        applying to set aside the judgment, especially if during
                        the period of delay, the successful party acted on the
                        judgment, or third parties acquired rights by reference
                        to it;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether complete retrial required
                        – whether the setting aside of a judgment would
                        entail a complete retrial on matters of fact which have
                        already been investigated by the
                    court;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_d"></a>(d)     Prospects of success – whether
                        the applicant enjoyed a real prospect of success;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_e"></a>(e)     Public interest – whether the
                        public interest in finality in litigation would be
                        compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     A case more on point was
                    that cited by the first/second defendants <em>viz</em> Selvam J’s (unreported) decision
                    in <em>Brosco International Pte Ltd v
                        Furniture &amp; Household Square Ltd</em>
                    [1997] [SGHC] 226. There, counsel for the
                    defendant applied for an adjournment on the third day of
                    trial. When the application was refused, the
                    defendant’s solicitor applied to discharge himself.
                    The request for discharge was also refused whereupon the
                    defendant’s counsel walked out of the proceedings. The
                    trial judge then proceeded to hear the case <em>ex </em><em>parte</em> after which judgment was awarded to
                    the plaintiff. The defendant subsequently filed a notice of
                    appeal <em>inter alia</em> to set aside
                    the judgment alternatively for an extension of time for
                    leave to appeal against the judgment. In dismissing the
                    application, Selvam J held that it was an abuse of process
                    for the defendant to render no assistance to the trial judge
                    by being absent and then file an appeal against the trial
                    judge’s decision on the merits of the
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the appeal application
                    was correctly brought under O 35 r 2 (which I held
                    it was not), the plaintiff would still fail as she did not
                    satisfy the criteria (a) to (e) in <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>. She failed to give a
                    satisfactory explanation for not filing the appeal
                    application within the 14 days stipulated under O 35
                    r 2(2) of the Rules <em>viz</em>
                    by 2 November 2011. It was filed by RWW on
                    3 January 2012, more than two months after
                    20 October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It is not for this court
                    to comment on the merits of the plaintiff’ claim
                    against the three defendants <em>ie</em> the criterion under (d) in <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>. However, I noted that on
                    20 October 2011 when the plaintiff complained of his
                    order of witnesses having been changed (when it was not),
                    Mr Ang had made a pertinent observation that although
                    the plaintiff’s claims were based on the alleged
                    professional negligence of the three defendants, her expert
                    witness Stone did not even deal with the plaintiff’
                    allegations in her statement of claim (Amendment No 1).
                    That being the case how was the plaintiff to cross-examine
                    the witnesses of the first and second defendants? She would
                    have no expert evidence to rely on to rebut their testimony.
                    The defendants contended that the plaintiff had no real
                    prospect of success for her claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Even assuming the
                    plaintiff has a good case, the other criteria in <em>Su Sh-Hsyu</em> dictates that the
                    plaintiff should not be allowed to revive her case. With
                    respect, Mr Woo’s submission that she should be
                    allowed to carry on where the plaintiff left off on
                    20 October 2011 has no merit – it would be a
                    blatant abuse of process by the plaintiff, in view of her
                    conduct that day. There ought to be finality to these
                    protracted proceedings in the interests of the defendants
                    and in the interests of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Another procedural
                    irregularity of the appeal application was in
                    prayer (c) at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above where RWW applied for a stay of
                    the plaintiff’s first appeal pending the outcome of
                    the appeal application. Such an application can only be made
                    to the Court of Appeal or, under s 36 of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed)
                    (“the SCJA”) to a High Court judge sitting as
                    a single judge in the Court of Appeal. The section
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In any proceeding pending
                            before the Court of Appeal, any direction incidental
                            thereto not involving the decision of the appeal,
                            any interim order to prevent prejudice to the claims
                            of parties pending the appeal, and any order for
                            security for costs and for the dismissal of an
                            appeal for default in furnishing security so
                            ordered, may at any time be made by a
                        Judge.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(2)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Every application under
                            subsection (1) shall be deemed to be a proceeding in
                            the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the appeal application was not filed
                    under the plaintiff’s first appeal but in this suit. I
                    could not deal with it under s 36 of the SCJA. Indeed I
                    could not hear it at all<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     No court would lightly
                    deny a litigant, especially one unrepresented, his day in
                    court. However, when a lay litigant behaved in the manner
                    the plaintiff did on 20 October 2011 despite the
                    court’s attempts to assist her and to militate against
                    whatever perceived disadvantages there were to her being
                    unrepresented, it does not lie in the plaintiff’s
                    mouth to contend that the court should give her another
                    chance for her case to be heard on its merits. To grant the
                    appeal application would be an abuse of
                process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Consequently, I dismissed
                    the appeal application with costs to all three
                    defendants.</p>
