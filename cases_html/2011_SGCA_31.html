        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) who had dismissed the
                    appellant’s claim for an indemnity from the respondent insurance company
                    under a Workmen’s Compensation Policy (see <em>Mohammed
                        Shahid Late Mahabubur Rahman v Lim Keenly Builders Pte Ltd (Tokio Marine
                        Insurance Singapore Ltd, third party)</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1021
                    (“the Judgment”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The issues that arise in this appeal are
                    deceptively simple and centre, in the main, on the concept of <em>construction</em> of the contract between the parties. However, as we
                    shall see, the principal difficulty lies in determining the <em>scope of application</em> of the insurance policy
                concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Lim Keenly Builders Pte Ltd (“the
                    Appellant”) was the main contractor for the design and erection of an
                    industrial building at Tuas South Avenue 3/Tuas Bay Drive (“the
                    Project”). In respect of this Project, the Appellant contracted two
                    policies with Tokio Marine Insurance Singapore Ltd (“the
                    Respondent”) on 4 May 2007: a Workmen’s Compensation Policy
                    No DWCP07S001548 (“the WC Policy”) and a
                    “Contractors’ All Risks Policy No DGCR07S004322 (“the
                    CAR Policy”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant was sued by a workman (“the
                    Plaintiff”) who had been seriously injured on 5 November 2007 while
                    working at the Project worksite. He had at the time been employed by Utracon
                    Structural System Pte Ltd (“Utracon”), to which the Appellant had
                    sub-contracted post-tensioning works. The Plaintiff alleged that the Appellant
                    had breached various statutory duties as well as its common law duty as occupier
                    of the premises on which the Plaintiff had been injured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant then brought third party
                    proceedings against the Respondent for an indemnity under the WC Policy
                    and/or the CAR Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Plaintiff and the Appellant reached a
                    settlement on the first day of trial and interlocutory judgment was entered for
                    95% of the Plaintiff’s damages, to be assessed. The trial thus proceeded
                    solely in respect of the Appellant’s claim against the Respondent for an
                    indemnity. At trial, the Appellant abandoned its claim based on the CAR Policy,
                    relying solely on the WC Policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The WC Policy </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">How the policy was concluded</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The WC Policy and CAR Policy were
                    simultaneously arranged and paid for by the Appellant through its insurance
                    brokers, HSBC Insurance Brokers (Singapore) Pte Ltd.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This was
                    in line with the main contract for the Project, which required the Appellant to
                    arrange for all necessary insurance policies before the work on the Project
                    could commence,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> as well as with common industry
                    practice whereby the main contractor typically arranges and pays for both the
                    Contractor’s All Risks Policy and Workmen’s Compensation policies,
                    for itself as well as on behalf of all its subcontractors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, the letter from the
                    Appellant awarding the subcontract to Utracon directed Utracon to “note
                    that the Main Contractor [the Appellant] will be arranging for the
                    Contractors’ All Risks Insurance and Workmen’s Compensation
                    Insurance for <em>the whole of the Works</em>”
                    [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As alluded to above (at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>), the Appellant arranged for these policies through HSBC
                    Insurance Brokers (Singapore) Pte Ltd, specifically its agent, Mr Lye Meng
                    Swee (“Mr Lye”). According to the Respondent’s claims
                    manager, Ms Swee Sow Chin (“Ms Swee”), the industry
                    practice is that when a would-be insured is represented by an insurance broker,
                    the insurance broker is the intermediary between the would-be insured and
                        insurer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Ms
                    Swee also gave evidence that brokers, as insurance professionals, would
                    “have a good understanding of the scope of coverage of the policy as well
                    as the policy terms and conditions and would be able to advise the main
                    contractor and the other insureds under the policy
                        accordingly”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This should be borne in
                    mind given that, in the court below, Mr Lye testified that he had
                    understood the scope of the WC policy to be consistent with the
                    construction put forward by the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Following some email correspondence between
                    Mr Lye and the Respondent’s agent, Ms Irina Loo
                    (“Ms Loo”), Mr Lye informed Ms Loo on 30 April
                    2007 that she could proceed to issue the WC and CAR Policies accordingly, and
                    requested that she send him the cover note to the policies (“the Cover
                    Note”). Upon receiving the Cover Note on 3 May 2007, Mr Lye
                    checked it and noted that the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) was
                    not included as a named insured. According to Mr Lye, the LTA requires that it
                    be named as an insured in insurance policies that covers any works linking a
                    driveway to a public road.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He therefore emailed
                    Ms Loo requesting that the Respondent include the LTA as a named insured.
                    This having been done, the WC and CAR Policies were finally issued on 4 May
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The terms of the policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is common ground that for a claim to be
                    covered by the WC Policy, it had to fall within the WC Policy’s
                    Operative Clause (“the Operative Clause”), which provides
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> “
                    … if any workman <em>in the Insured’s
                        employment</em> shall sustain personal injury by accident or disease
                    caused during the Period of Insurance and arising out of and in the course of
                    his employment by the Insured in the Business”, the Respondent will
                    “indemnify the Insured against all sums for which the Insured shall be
                    liable to pay compensation under the Legislation or at Common Law ...”
                    [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     “Legislation” is in turn defined
                    in the Interpretation Clause of the WC Policy as:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> “the Workmen’s Compensation
                    Act (Cap. 354), amendments and re-enactments thereof and any regulations
                    made thereunder”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     “[T]he Insured” is defined in
                    the “Name of Insured” Clause as:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    “Lim Keenly Builders Pte Ltd [and]/or their sub-contractors of all tiers
                    and level [<em>sic</em>] as contractor [and]/or
                    M/s Kim Teck Leong (Pte) Ltd [and]/or the Land Transport Authority as
                    principals for their respective rights and interests”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     M/s Kim Teck Leong (Pte) Ltd is the
                    developer and owner of the Project worksite, and the party which had originally
                    engaged the Appellant. The Land Transport Authority had to be named amongst
                    “the Insured” because the Project involved building a driveway and
                    linking it to a public road.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The parties’ submissions were similar to
                    those canvassed in the court below. In essence, the disagreement between the
                    parties centres on what interpretation ought to be accorded the definition of
                        “<em>in the Insured’s
                    employment</em>” in the Operative Clause (above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>) – in particular, whether the Operative
                    Clause covers a case such as that in the present proceedings, where the
                    plaintiff is employed by one party within the class of Insured (“a
                    co-insured”) but is suing <em>another</em>
                    co-insured instead of his direct employer (in this case, Utracon).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Appellant’s position is that the
                    Operative Clause does cover such cases. In other words, the WC policy
                    covers not only the liability of each contractor to its own employees, but also
                    any liability incurred by one contractor to the employees of any other
                    contractor within the class of what has been described in the WC Policy as
                    “the Insured”. In this case, therefore, the WC Policy covers
                    the Appellant’s liability to the Plaintiff even though he was employed by
                    Utracon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the other hand, the Respondent’s
                    position is that whilst all levels of contractors, main and sub-contractors
                    alike, fall within the class described as “the Insured” in the
                    WC Policy, there must be a relationship of employment between the <em>particular</em> contractor seeking an indemnity under the
                    WC Policy and the particular injured plaintiff. The Respondent accepts that
                    it would have had to indemnify Utracon had the Plaintiff sued Utracon, but it
                    contends that it is not obliged to indemnify the Appellant in respect of its
                    liability to the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     To this end, the parties disagree on the
                    effect of three particular features of the WC Policy, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The “Risk 001”
                        Clause;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Deletions from the “Exceptions” Clause;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Endorsements
                        attached to the Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The “Risk 001” Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The “Risk 001” Clause, which
                    defines the risk insured against, reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Workmen’s Compensation (Project)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Insured Employees</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Item 001. On all employees of insured and all tiers
                        subcontractors</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Contract Wageroll    S$1,504,000.00”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     According to the Appellant, this clause
                    indicates that “insured employees” clearly includes employees of
                    “all tiers subcontractors”. The Respondent, however, argues that
                    this clause does not change the scope of the Operative Clause but was, instead,
                    meant to expand the coverage from <em>workmen</em>
                        (<em>viz</em>, only manual labourers or non-manual
                    labourers with a monthly income not exceeding $1600) to all <em>employees</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Deletions from the “Exceptions” Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Respondent’s standard
                    Workmen’s Compensation Policy jacket has an “Exceptions”
                    Clause excluding its liability in respect of various items. Two items were
                    deleted from this in the present WC Policy:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Sub-clause (b): “the
                        Insured’s liability to employees of independent contractors engaged by
                        the Insured”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Sub-clause (c): “any employee of the Insured
                        who is not a ‘workman’ within the meaning of the
                        Legislation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Appellant argues that the deletion of
                    sub-clause (b) was clearly intended to make the Respondent liable in
                    respect of claims brought against the Appellant by its subcontractor’s
                    employees, whereas the standard “Exceptions” Clause would have
                    excluded liability for this. The Respondent denies this and argues, instead,
                    that the two sub-clauses had to be deleted to maintain consistency with what it
                    submits to be the effect of Endorsement B, as set out below (see generally
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>–<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>). In any case, the Respondent argues that it is irrelevant
                    to consider the “Exceptions” Clause unless the Appellant can bring
                    its claim within the Operative Clause in the first place, which it cannot
                    do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Endorsements attached to the Schedule</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Two rather involved Endorsements are attached
                    to the policy Schedule. Endorsement A reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… in the event of any workmen employed by the within Insured or by
                        the Insured’s Contractors as referred to in Endorsement B hereon or
                        any dependent of such workmen, bringing or making a claim under any
                        Workmen’s Compensation Act Cap 354 for the time being in force in
                        the Republic of Singapore against any officer of the principal for personal
                        injury or disease sustained whilst at work on any Contract covered by the
                        terms and conditions of the within policy which the Insured may be carrying
                        out for the said officer of the principal the Company [the Respondent] will
                        indemnify the said officer or principal against such claim, and any costs,
                        charges and expenses in respect thereof. Provided always that the Company
                        shall be entitled to have the sole conduct and control of all proceedings
                        connected with claims covered by this endorsement. Nothing in the
                        endorsement shall be constructed as affecting the Insured’s right to
                        recover damages in any other way under the said legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Endorsement B provides as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the indemnity herein granted is intended to cover the legal
                        liability of the Insured to workmen in the employment of contractors
                        performing work for the Insured while engaged in the business and occupation
                        in respect of which the within policy is granted but only so far as regards
                        Claims under any Workmen’s Compensation Act Cap 354 for the time
                        being in force in the Republic of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Respondent argues that Endorsement B
                    specifically extends the WC Policy to cover the liability of the Insured to
                    workmen employed by its sub-contractors, but only in respect of “claims
                    under any Workmen’s Compensation Act”, and <em>not</em> to common law claims such as the one here. Such an extension
                    would not be necessary if the Appellant was correct in arguing that the
                    Operative Clause already covered this. Furthermore, the Respondent argues that
                    it is because of Endorsement B that the two sub-clauses (<em>viz</em>, (b) and (c)) above had to be deleted from the
                    “Exceptions” Clause, and the deletions must therefore be read
                    subject to Endorsement B.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Appellant, on the other hand, argues that
                    Endorsements A and B must be read together, and that they apply only to the
                    LTA. In this regard, both Endorsements are stated in Memorandum 3 of the
                    WC Policy to be “applicable to the Land Transport
                    Authority”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Judge rejected all the Appellant’s
                    arguments as set out above (and which, as mentioned, are reprised in the present
                    proceedings). Instead, he accepted the Respondent’s submission that the
                    WC Policy only applies where there is a relationship of employment between
                    the <em>particular</em> contractor seeking an indemnity and
                    the particular injured plaintiff. Hence, he dismissed the Appellant’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The only issue before this court, therefore,
                    is whether the WC Policy applies only where a co-insured incurs liability
                    towards its own particular employees, <em>or</em> whether
                    it applies regardless of whether liability is incurred towards its own employee
                    or towards <em>anyone</em> in the <em>pool</em> of individuals <em>employed by the various
                        co-insured for the purpose of the Project</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">An important threshold point</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Before proceeding to consider the detailed
                    arguments made by the parties to the present appeal, an important threshold
                    point ought to be made at the outset. Given that this appeal turns on the
                    concept of interpretation in general and interpretation of the Operative Clause
                    in particular, the first port of call must obviously be the actual language of
                    the Operative Clause read together with the other relevant clauses. If the
                    meaning of the clause is clear from the language of the clause itself, having
                    regard to the context of the contract (see generally the seminal decision of
                    this court on the principles of contractual interpretation set out in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp;
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029), all other
                    specific arguments purporting to aid its interpretation are unnecessary,
                        <em>except</em> where they may demonstrate that the
                    meaning of the clause is not so clear as it appears at first
                blush.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In our view, this point is, in the context of
                    the present appeal, not only an important one but also a crucial one. As we
                    shall see, all the detailed arguments on specific features of the
                    WC Policy, made by both parties, tended to generate more
                    “heat” than “light”. More to the point, we are of
                    the view that a plain reading of Operative Clause read in the context of the
                    WC Policy supports, in and of itself, the Appellant’s interpretation.
                    By seeking to buttress his case with more specific and detailed points of
                    construction, the then counsel for the Appellant in the court below regrettably diverted the attention of
                    the court away from the central path which was clear, and which ought to have been the path taken. Instead, all concerned were led on a
                    “detour” that ultimately resulted in the Judge arriving at what,
                    with great respect, was an erroneous destination. Indeed, there is at least a
                    hint in the Judgment itself which acknowledges the commercial purpose of the
                    Operative Clause which, owing to the unscheduled “detour”, the
                    Judge was unable to give effect to: in particular, the Judge observed as follows
                    (at [81] of the Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>It appears to me that the defendant and its insurance
                            broker believed that the WC Policy was sufficiently comprehensive
                            to embrace the present indemnity claim. However genuine their belief may
                            be, the task of the court is to construe the terms of the insurance
                            policy in order to determine its scope and whether on its true
                            construction the indemnity claimed by the defendant is
                            payable</em></b>. Unfortunately for the defendant, the WC Policy
                        only responds to indemnity claims brought by any of the Insured in respect
                        of liability incurred at common law or under the Act to its employees. It
                        does not respond to common law claims (as opposed to claims under the Act,
                        which are brought within and covered by the WC Policy as a result of
                        Endorsement B) brought by non-employees against the Insured as occupier of
                        the worksite. <b><em>While this may seem like an anomalous
                            lacuna, as explained by counsel for the Insurer, it is always possible
                            for the defendant or any insured to procure a policy to cover the
                            current situation</em></b>. That could be achieved, for example, by
                        deleting the proviso “<em>but only so far as regards
                            Claims under any Workmen's Compensation Act Cap 354 for the time being
                            in force</em>” [emphasis added] from Endorsement B.
                        Obviously there are other ways to arrange insurance to cover the present
                        situation. It is ultimately a question of pricing, <em>ie</em>, the premium. [Italics in original; emphasis added in
                        bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In fairness to counsel for the Appellant,
                    however, one of his main arguments did centre on the meaning of the Operative
                    Clause. Nor do we mean to state that all the other points raised by the
                    Appellant were irrelevant or unarguable. Indeed, as we shall see, some of the
                    points were, in fact, consistent with the Appellant’s overall case.
                    Nevertheless, the crucial point, in our view, is that a plain reading of the
                    language of the Operative Clause in its proper context would have sufficed to
                    dispose of the central issue in the present proceedings and that at least some
                    of the specific points raised by the Appellant served to cloud this central
                    pathway by way of what may be termed a “legal overkill”. It might
                    well have been the case that the Respondent might have raised these precise
                    points as it was, of course, well entitled to do. However, the onus would then
                    have been on <em>the Respondent</em> to utilise these
                    points in order to <em>negative</em> what would otherwise
                    have been a clear interpretation of the Operative Clause in the
                    Appellant’s favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Be that as it may, as the specific points were
                    raised and argued in some detail by both parties here as well as in the court
                    below, it is of course necessary for us to address them. However, we ought to
                    nevertheless begin at the beginning by looking – first and foremost
                    – at the actual language of the Operative Clause itself in order to
                    ascertain whether, at <em>that</em> particular point, a
                    clear result emerges in favour of a particular party’s interpretation. As
                    alluded to above, we are of the view that a clear result <em>does</em> emerge – a point we deal with in the very next
                    section of this judgment. That having been said, we will nevertheless also
                    proceed to consider the specific points raised in order to demonstrate why they
                    are either consistent with the clear result just mentioned or are, at best,
                    neutral points that do not advance the Respondent’s case. With this
                    “road map” in mind, let us now proceed to consider the relevant
                    clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Construction of the Operative Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Although it has already been referred to
                    above, because of their pivotal significance to the outcome of the present
                    appeal, it would be appropriate to set out the material clauses again,
                    commencing with the Operative Clause, as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">NOW THIS POLICY WITNESSETH that if any workman in <em>the

                        and in the course of his employment by <em>the

                            <em>the Insured</em> shall be liable to pay
                        compensation either under the Legislation or at Common Law, and will in
                        addition pay all costs and expenses incurred by <em>the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As already alluded to above, also material in
                    the context of the present appeal is the “Name of the Insured”
                    Clause, which reads as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Judge commenced his analysis of the
                    Operative Clause in the court below as follows (see the Judgment at [16]-[17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16     As stated, the defendant must bring its
                        indemnity claim within the Operative Clause in order to succeed in this
                        action, but the main obstacle that stands in the way of the defendant is the
                        undeniable fact that the plaintiff was not in its employment at the time of
                        the accident. Instead, he was employed by Utracon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17     The inherent difficulty facing the
                        defendant is self-evident when a plain reading of the Operative Clause is
                        adopted, for it reveals that the term “Insured” must be
                        understood as referring to different entities in order for the defendant's
                        claim to be maintained ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     With respect, the opening words of the
                    Judge’s analysis (see the Judgment at [16]) appeared to assume the answer to the very issue that was
                    central to the resolution of the proceedings themselves. In fairness, however,
                    to the Judge, perhaps one alternative interpretation is to that he was merely
                    stating (without pronouncing upon) what “the main obstacle” before
                    the Appellant in the court below was, although the phrase “<em>undeniable</em> fact” appears to point in the other
                    direction (see the Judgment at [16],
                    reproduced in the preceding paragraph [emphasis added]). Indeed, the Judge
                    proceeded to express, in the next paragraph, the view that “a <em>plain reading</em> of the Operative Clause” militated
                    against the construction adopted by the Appellant (see the Judgment at [17], reproduced in the preceding paragraph
                    [emphasis added]). This view is also reiterated towards the end of the Judgment
                    (at [72]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We respectfully differ from the Judge’s
                    view. In our view, a plain reading of the Operative Clause does indeed support
                    the Appellant’s construction. The Operative Clause does not operate in a
                    vacuum or a hermetically sealed environment. In particular, its interpretation
                    depends on a determination of <em>who</em> is (or, as the
                    case may be, who are) “<em>the Insured</em>”
                    within the meaning and scope of the Operative Clause itself. That this is a
                    crucial inquiry is clear because, once “the Insured” is
                    ascertained for the purposes of the Operative Clause, the result of this appeal
                    follows logically therefrom. Put simply, if “the Insured” in the
                    Operative Clause refers, <em>collectively</em>, to
                        <em>all</em> the contractors (including the Appellant
                    and the Respondent), then the Appellant’s construction of the Operative
                    Clause ought to prevail. If, on the other hand, “the Insured” in
                    the Operative Clause refers, instead, <em>only</em> to
                        <em>a single contractor</em> at any given point in
                    time, then the Respondent’s construction of the Operative Clause ought to
                    prevail as the Plaintiff was <em>Utracon’s</em>
                    employee and the Operative Clause would only operate (as the Respondent itself
                    agreed) to permit <em>Utracon</em> (but <em>not</em> the Appellant) to be indemnified by the Respondent if it
                    (Utracon) was sued by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is clear, in our view, that “the
                    Insured” in the Operative Clause refers, <em>collectively</em>, to <em>all</em> the
                    contractors. That this is so is evident from <em>a plain reading
                        of the “Name of the Insured” Clause</em> (reproduced
                    above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> and <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>). Indeed, that clause suggests that <em>all</em> the contractors involved in the Project were <em>to be treated as a single entity</em> for the purposes of the
                    WC Policy: it names the Insured as “Lim Keenly Builders Pte Ltd
                    &amp;/or their sub-contractors of all tiers and level [<em>sic</em>] <em>as contractor ..</em>.”
                    [emphasis added], <em>ie</em>, as a single entity. It is
                    true that the Respondent had argued that there had been a drafting error on its
                    part, and that it had actually intended the “Name of Insured”
                    clause to read, “Lim Keenly Builders Pte Ltd as contractor and/or their
                    subcontractors of all tiers and level[s]” instead, <em>ie</em>, that the term “contractor” would apply only to
                    the Appellant and not to it together with its subcontractors as a single
                        entity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> However, in interpreting the
                    terms of a written contract, a party’s <em>subjective</em> assertion that a drafting error was made is
                    irrelevant in the face of the <em>objective</em> meaning of
                    the terms concerned. In fact we find such an argument to be even more
                    unacceptable given the circumstances in which insurance contracts are typically
                    drafted: as this court observed in <em>Tay Eng Chuan v Ace
                        Insurance Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 95 at [35], albeit in a different context, insurance
                    contracts are invariably drafted and/or vetted by experts to protect the
                    interests of the insurers, and the insured generally have little choice but to
                    accept the terms thereof. In such a context, it does not lie in the mouth of the
                    Respondent to assert that it intended a material clause to read differently from
                    the actual words used, much less to argue that this ought to be the meaning to
                    be ascribed to the clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We therefore find that the plain meaning of
                    the Operative Clause is such that it does not apply only where there is a
                    relationship of employment between the <em>particular</em>
                    co-insured and the injured workman towards whom the co-insured has incurred
                    liability. It is appropriate here for us to address the decision of this court
                    in <em>Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction &amp;
                        Engineering Co Ltd and other appeals</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 746
                        (“<em>Awang bin Dollah</em>”), which the
                    Respondent relies heavily upon as authority in its favour. We should point out
                    that <em>Awang bin Dollah</em> involved a completely
                    different question of interpretation, namely, whether the term
                    “Sub-Contractors’ Workers” in that part of the policy
                    defining its coverage included the workers of <em>sub</em>-sub-contractors. This court found that it did not and, on that
                    basis, dismissed the appellant’s claim against the respondent insurer (see
                        <em>Awang bin Dollah</em> at [52]–[58]). The observation of the
                    court, at [59] of its judgment, that the appellant was in any case not entitled
                    to an indemnity because the injured workman was not its own employee, was
                    therefore purely <em>obiter dicta</em>. Even so, it is
                        <em>obiter dicta</em> that may not apply in the context
                    of the present appeal. While the Judge noted that the operative clause in
                        <em>Awang bin Dollah</em> was materially identical to
                    the Operative Clause here, with respect, that does not (in and of itself) take
                    us far without establishing the class of insured to which the operative clause
                    in <em>Awang bin Dollah</em> applied. The policy in
                        <em>Awang bin Dollah</em> explicitly covered only the
                    main contractor and “3 General Labourers (Sub-contractors’
                    Workers)” – the unusual narrowness of which was commented upon by
                    the court at [55]. This is quite unlike
                    the expansive language of the “Name of Insured” Clause in the
                    WC Policy in the present appeal and its definition of the insured risk as
                    being “<em>on all employees of insured and all tiers
                        subcontractors</em>” [emphasis added] (see the “Risk
                    001” Clause reproduced above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Indeed, it fully accords with the commercial
                    purpose of the WC Policy that the Operative Clause treats the contractors
                    of all levels as a single entity. As the Appellant has argued, the Project would
                    (necessarily and practically) involve not only the main contractor (<em>viz</em>, the Appellant) but numerous other sub-contractors
                    (of whom Utracon was one) as well; it was essential that the WC Policy
                    cover liability towards <em>all</em> employees of <em>all</em> the contractors involved in the Project (especially
                    since, in the nature of things, the work on the Project would, in the nature of
                    things, entail a fair amount of “crossover” interaction amongst
                    the various contractors and employees). In a related vein, the Appellant also
                    noted in its case, as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The WC Policy was to insure the Appellant on the basis of the Project
                        as a whole. The Project’s contract value was $7,520,000.00 and the
                        contract wageroll was $1,504,000.00. This wageroll is calculated at 20% of
                        the contract value of $7,520,000.00, and was <em>meant to
                            cover the wages of subcontractors of all tiers</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would make eminent practical sense for the policy concerned to have
                    been taken out by the Appellant (who was the main contractor) on behalf of
                    itself as well as <em>all</em> the other sub-contractors
                    (which would be covered by the phrase “of all tiers and level[s]”
                    in the “Name of the Insured” Clause). Indeed, this is borne out by
                    undisputed facts. As noted above (at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>),
                    the main contract for the Project required the Appellant to arrange for all
                    necessary insurance policies before the work on the Project could
                        commence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The letter from the Appellant awarding
                    the subcontract to Utracon directed Utracon to “note that the Main
                    Contractor [the Appellant] will be arranging for the Contractors’ All
                    Risks Insurance and Workmen’s Compensation Insurance for <em>the whole of the Works</em>.” [emphasis
                        added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> According to the evidence of the
                    Respondent’s own claims manager, this was in line with common industry
                    practice, whereby the main contractor typically arranges and pays for both the
                    Contractor’s All Risks Policy and Workmen’s Compensation policies
                    for itself as well as on behalf of all its subcontractors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In this regard, it is strange to imagine that
                    the parties intended the application of the WC Policy to depend on so
                    technical a distinction as whether the injured Plaintiff chose to sue the
                    Appellant or Utracon, and on what cause of action he therefore chose to invoke
                    (which is the gist of the Respondent’s case). This is especially so when
                    we consider that the full commercial context of the WC Policy includes its
                    interaction with the Contractors’ All Risks Policy (the “CAR
                    Policy”) issued by the Respondent to the Appellant at the same time in
                    respect of the same Project. This is a dimension which was unfortunately not
                    explored in the proceedings below because the Appellant abandoned its reliance
                    on the CAR Policy, but it is one that we find significant. In this regard, we
                    find that <em>an examination of the interplay between the CAR
                        Policy and the WC Policy buttresses the interpretation of the Operative
                        Clause as established above</em>. The CAR Policy insures, <em>inter alia</em>, against “Third Party
                    Liability”, including accidental bodily injury or illness to third
                    parties “occurring in direct connection with the construction or
                    erection” of the Project and “happening on or in the immediate
                    vicinity of the site”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> We have already
                    noted in the preceding paragraph that it was for the Appellant to make the
                    necessary insurance arrangements for itself and its subcontractors <em>comprehensively</em>. If the Appellant’s liability
                    towards employees of its sub-contractors was already covered under the CAR
                    Policy, the Respondent’s restrictive interpretation of the Operative
                    Clause might have been more tenable. However, the CAR Policy excludes
                    “liability consequent upon ... bodily injury or to [<em>sic</em>] illness of employees or workmen of the Contractor(s) or the
                    Principal(s) or any other firm connected with the project ... or members of
                    their families”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The plain language of
                    this exclusionary clause precludes the application of the CAR Policy in
                        <em>any</em> situation in which an employee of any
                    level of sub-contractor is injured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     This is probably the reason why the Appellant
                    abandoned its reliance on the CAR Policy in the court below. Of course, as we
                    have already noted, the subjective intention of one party, without more, is
                    irrelevant to contractual interpretation. However, the fact that the CAR Policy
                    unambiguously excludes <em>all</em> types of liability with
                    respect to <em>all</em> cases concerning injury to
                    employees does appear, in our view, to lend weight to the inference that parties
                    understood this category to be dealt with somewhere else, <em>ie</em>, under the WC Policy. Indeed, we found the
                    Respondent’s pleadings in the proceedings below to be rather strange in so
                    far as they denied that the WC Policy applied to this case, and then denied
                    liability under the CAR Policy as well, solely on the basis of the
                        WC Policy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Of course, there is the second possible
                    conclusion that the parties did not intend to cover <em>at
                        all</em> any tortious liability the Appellant might incur towards the
                    employees of its subcontractors in the course of the Project. Put simply, the
                    Appellant would be indemnified under the WC Policy for liability to its own
                    employees (and similarly, each subcontractor for liability to its own respective
                    employees), and under the CAR Policy for liability to “pure” third
                    parties, but that its recourse with regard to liability to employees of its
                    subcontractors would fall into a “legal black hole” situated
                    somewhere between these two policies. We find this to be extremely unlikely in
                    light of the commercial context we have already discussed above. Most
                    significantly, this would imply that the parties intended that <em>whether or not a given case falls within this “legal black
                        hole” depends completely on the choice and actions of a third party
                        who is unlikely to be even addressing its mind to any issue of insurance
                        between the Appellant and Respondent in the first place</em>. With
                    respect, we cannot imagine that the parties had intended this to be the
                    cornerstone of the legal obligations between them. We cannot envisage that the
                    main contractor arranged and <em>paid for</em> insurance
                    coverage for its subcontractors but intended to leave its own liability
                    uncovered upon a contingency dictated solely by the prerogative of the injured
                    plaintiff. We find it equally implausible that the Respondent, being fully aware
                    of this commercial and practical context, understood them to be doing so. It is
                    also significant that the insurance broker concerned understood there to be no
                    such “legal black hole”, especially given the Respondent’s
                    claims manager’s own testimony that such insurance brokers are
                    intermediaries between would-be insurers and insured, and are insurance
                    professionals with “a good understanding of the scope of coverage of the
                    policy as well as the policy terms and conditions” (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In summary, it is clear that the plain
                    language of the Operative Clause, read together with the “Name of the
                    Insured” Clause achieved the very purpose which the Judge envisaged the
                    parties to the present proceedings to have contemplated (as expressed in the
                    Judgment at [81]). Why, then, did the Judge feel compelled to arrive at a
                    different interpretation of the Operative Clause? In this regard, it is only
                    appropriate that we examine the Judge’s specific reasons for rejecting the
                    construction we have taken of the Operative Clause (see generally the Judgment
                    at [40]–[54]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The first specific reason is one which we can
                    deal with simply, <em>viz</em>, that the construction the
                    Appellant had argued for “is an extremely strained interpretation”
                    because there is no express clause as such (see the Judgment at [40]). With respect, the “Name of the
                    Insured” Clause is not being relied on in and by itself, but is, rather,
                    being read <em>together with</em> the Operative Clause in
                        <em>an integrated and holistic</em> fashion which also
                    takes into account the <em>intention</em> of the parties
                    themselves. Viewed in this light, the plain meaning of the Operative Clause is,
                    in our view, clear and clearly supports the Appellant’s construction of
                    that clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The second specific reason given is that, in
                    “the absence of plain wording to such effect”, the
                    Appellant’s construction of the Operative Clause ought not to be given
                    effect to as “[the] result is so manifestly contrary to established
                    principles of tort law that it is inconceivable that it can be achieved via an
                    inadequately-drafted definition clause” (see the Judgment at [41]). With respect, however, the issue is not
                    one relating to tort law as such but, rather, the <em>contractual
                        agreement</em> between the parties in an insurance
                contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The third specific reason appears, at first
                    blush, to be the most persuasive one, and is the one that the Judge relied on at
                    some length (see the Judgment at [42]–[54]). This
                    reason is that “the interpretation argued by the defendant [<em>viz</em>, the Appellant] requires the defendant and Ultracon
                    to be treated as one joint entity, <em>viz</em>, the
                    “contractor” and that “[t]this implies that the
                    WC Policy is, on the defendant’s interpretation, a joint policy
                    rather than a composite policy” (see the Judgment at [42]). The Judge, however, was of the view
                    that the WC Policy is a <em>composite</em> policy.
                    Specifically, the Judge rejected the Appellant’s argument that the
                    dichotomy between joint and composite policies only applies in the context of
                    property insurance (see the Judgment at [52]–[53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     We agree that the Appellant’s
                    confinement of the dichotomy to property insurance is without merit. With
                    respect, however, it appears that the dichotomy itself was fundamentally
                    misunderstood in the proceedings below – this being one instance of the
                    legal “detour” that we alluded to earlier at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>. The dichotomy between joint and composite
                    policies does <em>not</em> go towards <em>defining</em> each party’s insured interests. Rather, <em>it goes towards establishing when an insurer can avoid its
                        obligations against an innocent co-insured because of misconduct on the part
                        of another co-insured</em>, such as fraud or breach of a condition to
                    notify the insurer of certain developments (see, for example, The Honourable
                    Desmond Derrington QC &amp; Ronald Shaw Ashton, <em>The Law
                        of Liability Insurance</em> (2nd Ed, LexisNexis, 2005) at
                    para 2-404). For example, in the oft-cited English Court of Appeal decision
                    of <em>General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation,
                        Limited, and another v Midland Bank, Limited, and Others</em> [1940]
                    2 KB 388, the fact that the policy was a composite one went towards
                    the conclusion that that fraud on the part of one co-insured did not affect the
                    insurer’s obligations to all the other co-insured. The Judge rightly
                    established (see the Judgment at [43]–[44]) that
                    the test for distinguishing between the two is the nature of the
                    co-insured’s interests (<em>ie</em>, whether they are
                    joint or separate). However, the Judge and the parties do not appear, with
                    respect, to have appreciated that such a test inherently requires one to
                        <em>first</em> determine what the insured interest of
                    each party is. <em>Only then</em> can one decide whether
                    these interests are joint or separate. The Judge’s approach (and the
                    approach the parties have taken) has therefore, again with respect, <em>inverted the logic</em> of the entire process of analysis.
                    The Judge looked to the dichotomy between joint and composite policies to
                    determine what the Appellant’s insured interest is (<em>ie</em>, whether it extends to liability to sub-contractor’s
                    employees). <em>However</em>, this was the very issue to be
                    decided in the court below (and on appeal), and one which the dichotomy just
                    mentioned does not aid in resolving. The Hong Kong Court of First Instance
                    decision of <em>The New India Assurance Company Limited v Dewi
                        Estates Limited &amp; Others</em> [2009] HKCU 1403 provides
                    a useful illustration of the approach that ought to be taken. In that case, in a
                    factual matrix very similar to that in the present appeal, the court <em>first</em> determined the extent of each co-insured’s
                    interests insured under the policy <em>before</em>
                    analysing what this meant for the policy in terms of whether it was joint or
                    composite. The dichotomy between a joint policy and a composite policy is, by
                    definition, a <em>subsequent</em> step in the reasoning or
                    analysis, and, even then, a subsequent step that is only relevant if the insurer
                    is seeking to avoid its obligations on the basis that one co-insured has
                    breached the terms of the policy concerned. That is not the case here.
                    Therefore, we find that the dichotomy between a joint policy and a composite
                    policy is a “legal red herring” in the context of what needs to be
                    decided in the context of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the circumstances, therefore, we find that
                    an analysis of the Operative Clause demonstrates that the WC Policy applies
                    where a co-insured incurs liability towards anyone in the pool of individuals
                    employed by the various co-insured for the purposes of the Project, and not only
                    when a co-insured incurs liability towards its own employees. If the analysis in
                    this part of the judgment had been adopted in the court below, that would have
                    sufficed to dispose the proceedings, albeit in the opposite direction. However,
                    a number of other (more specific) arguments were canvassed. As we have noted
                    above, this was unfortunate as they served to obscure – rather than
                    illuminate – the path to what ought to have been, in our view, the correct
                    legal result. Nevertheless, as these arguments were canvassed in some detail
                    both here and in the court below, we now turn to consider them <em>seriatim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other specific arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The “Risk 001” Clause </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As already noted above (at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>), the Appellant argues that the “Risk
                    001” Clause (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>) indicates that “insured employees” clearly
                    includes employees of “all tiers subcontractors”. The Respondent,
                    however, argues that this clause does not change the scope of the Operative
                    Clause but was, instead, meant to expand the coverage from <em>workmen</em> (<em>viz</em>, only manual
                    labourers or non-manual labourers with a monthly income not exceeding $1600) to
                    all <em>employees</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In the court below, the Judge rejected the
                    Appellant’s argument. In his view, the Appellant’s argument was
                    “at odds” with its own evidence given by Mr Lye, who was
                    formerly the Senior Manager of HSBC Insurance Brokers (Singapore) Pte Ltd, and
                    was (it will be recalled) the insurance broker who arranged the WC Policy
                    on behalf of the Appellant (see above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                    and the Judgment at [59]). He agreed, instead, with the Respondent’s
                    argument and concluded as follows (see the Judgment at [59]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he “Risk No 001” Clause was inserted to expand the
                        definition of a “workman”; it did not otherwise change the
                        scope of the Operative Clause – in particular, by modifying the
                        concept of “employment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On appeal, the Appellant argued that Mr Lye
                    had merely been giving his personal opinion and that his evidence had been
                    wrongly admitted in contravention of s 95 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97,
                    1997 Rev Ed). This argument is, with respect, not very persuasive. In any event,
                    even if the Appellant’s argument with respect to the “Risk
                    001” Clause is rejected, this is merely a neutral factor in so far as its
                    overall case is concerned. The rejection of this argument, on the other hand,
                    certainly does not advance the Respondent’s case, especially since it does
                    not detract from the construction we arrived at in the preceding part of this
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Deletions from the “Exceptions” Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     To recapitulate, the Appellant had argued that
                    Exceptions (b) and (c) (see above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>) had been deleted in order to extend the scope of the
                    Operative Clause to include coverage for the Appellant’s liability for
                    claims made by employees who were not its own but who were, rather, employees of
                    other sub-contractors (such as the situation here where the Plaintiff was the
                    employee of Utracon, who was the sub-contractor).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Appellant’s (related) argument that
                    legal effect ought to be given to such deletions is a sound one. The main
                    argument itself – as briefly summarised in the preceding paragraph –
                    does appear (in contrast to the argument centring on the “Risk
                    001” Clause) to be supported by the oral testimony of Mr Lye.
                    Further, and looking at the individual clauses themselves, the deletion of what
                    were in substance constraints on the responsibility assumed by the Appellant
                    does appear to suggest that the Operative Clause ought to be read more broadly
                    so as to include coverage for the Appellant’s liability for claims made by
                    employees of other sub-contractors (which would include the claim by the
                    Plaintiff against the Appellant in the context of the present proceedings). Put
                    simply, we are of the view that this particular argument tends to <em>support</em> the Appellant’s construction of the
                    Operative Clause (read especially with the “Name of the Insured”
                    Clause) and, at the very least, does not assist the Respondent’s
                    (contrary) construction of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Endorsements attached to the Schedule</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Again, the parties’ arguments are set
                    out above at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>. This is the only specific argument that
                    militates strongly against the interpretation of the Operative Clause we have
                    adopted above, and relates to the Endorsements attached to the Schedule.
                    According to the Respondent, Endorsement B specifically extends the
                    WC Policy to cover the liability of the Insured to workmen employed by its
                    sub-contractors, except that this is limited to “claims under any
                    Workmen’s Compensation Act” and <em>not</em>
                    to common law claims. Such an extension, so the Respondent’s argument
                    goes, would be redundant if the Appellant was correct in arguing that the
                    Operative Clause already covered this and common law claims as well. Therefore,
                    if the Respondent is correct in arguing that Endorsement B does apply to the
                    entire class of Insured in the WC Policy, this necessarily militates
                    against the interpretation of the Operative Clause which we have adopted above.
                    The Appellant, however, argues that Endorsements A and B must be read
                    together, and that they apply only to the LTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Endorsement A clearly applies only to the LTA
                    because it refers to “the principal”, a point not challenged by
                    the Respondent. What is less clear – and this is a question the Judge,
                    with respect, failed to address – is whether Endorsement B is a
                    stand-alone clause or is co-dependent with Endorsement A.
                    Endorsement A contains the statement “as referred to in
                    Endorsement B hereon”, suggesting that the two are co-dependent.
                    However, where Endorsement B refers to “the indemnity herein
                    granted”, it is not clear whether “herein granted” refers
                    to the WC Policy as a whole or to the indemnity specifically granted in
                    Endorsement A. Despite, however, the ambiguity in the language of the
                    Endorsements themselves, we find that the overwhelming evidence demonstrates
                    that the two Endorsements must be read together and as only applying to the LTA.
                    The first reference to Endorsements A and B in the WC Policy, in the
                    attached memoranda, provides in parenthesis that the Endorsements are
                    “applicable to the Land Transport Authority”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In the proceedings
                    below, the Appellant’s insurance broker gave evidence that
                    Endorsements A and B are required by the LTA in all Workmen’s
                    Compensation Policies relating to works linking a driveway to a public
                        road,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> and that insurance policies
                    covering works not involving the LTA typically do not include
                    Endorsements A and B.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>
                    Crucially, when the Judge queried the Respondent’s counsel,
                    Mr Richard Kuek, whether Endorsements A and B are specific clauses
                    stipulated by the LTA and “more or less drafted” by the LTA,
                    Mr Kuek had answered that they were indeed so, according to his own
                        understanding.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> It was
                    also notable that Mr Lye’s evidence was that Endorsements A and
                    B may not be necessary if LTA was not involved.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> The Respondent’s
                    contention, however, was that, albeit having been inserted on the requirement of
                    the LTA, the Endorsements must be read objectively to refer to all the Insured
                    and not just the LTA. However, the Respondent had no answer to the Judge’s
                    question as to why (as stated above) the attached memoranda indicated the
                    Endorsements A and B as “applicable to the LTA”; if the
                    Insurer was right that, notwithstanding that the Endorsements were inserted as a
                    requirement by the LTA, they applied to other parties once they were indeed
                    inserted, then merely inserting the Endorsements would have been sufficient,
                    without stipulating that they were “applicable to the LTA”. In our
                    view, therefore, Endorsements A and B are confined to the LTA and do not
                    affect the interpretation of the Operative Clause which we have adopted
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A summary and conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It is clear that none of the specific
                    arguments considered above negatives or detracts from the construction we have
                    arrived at in the first part of this judgment and which results from a plain
                    reading of the Operative Clause (read together with, especially, the
                    “Name of the Insured” Clause). Indeed, as we have seen, some of
                    these arguments actually <em>support</em> the construction
                    we have arrived at. Finally, we would also like to note that the Appellant also
                    sought to rely on s 17 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act
                    (Cap 354, 1998 Rev Ed) (now s 17 (as amended) of the Work Injury
                    Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed)). However, in view of our findings
                    above, this issue is moot and we therefore say no more about it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     For the reasons set out above, the appeal is
