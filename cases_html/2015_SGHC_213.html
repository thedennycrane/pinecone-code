<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action is brought by the
                                        plaintiff, Sports Connection Pte Ltd (“Sports
                                        Connection”) against its former solicitors for
                                        professional negligence in and about the conduct of Sports
                                        Connection’s assessment of damages in Suit No 630 of
                                        1999 (hereinafter referred to as either “Suit
                                        630” or “the Singapore Assessment”)
                                        against Mr N Swami and Mr Velekatt Krishnan Sankara
                                        Narayanan, the partners of a law firm, Messrs Swami &amp;
                                        Narayanan (“S&amp;N”) in Singapore (for ease
                                        of reference, the defendants in Suit 630 shall be referred
                                        to as S&amp;N). S&amp;N was engaged by Sports Connection to
                                        register its trademark in Malaysia in 1991, but the
                                        partnership ended up being sued by Sports Connection for
                                        botching that registration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Sports Connection is a company
                                        incorporated in Singapore and is a wholesaler and retailer
                                        of sporting goods and equipment. It is also a manufacturer
                                        of luggage bags, brief cases and the like. Mr Yee Kok Chew
                                        (“Mr Yee”) and his wife, Ms Chang Hui Ming
                                        (“Ms Chang”), are the directors and
                                        shareholders of Sports Connection. Sports Connection is said
                                        to be the registered proprietor of the “BODYPAC +
                                        DEVICE” trademark in Singapore (“the
                                        Trademark”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Sports Connection’s
                                        dissatisfaction with the outcome of the assessment of
                                        damages in Suit 630 against S&amp;N subsequently led to the
                                        commencement of this action against three law firms on 1
                                        September 2011, more than two years after the second
                                        defendant, Asia Law Corporation (“ALC”),
                                        ceased to have conduct of Suit 630.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The present action against the first
                                        defendant, Netto &amp; Magin LLC (“N&amp;M”),
                                        was discontinued on 13 November 2013. Sports Connection,
                                        however, continued with this action which proceeded to trial
                                        against ALC and the third defendant, Samuel Seow Law
                                        Corporation (“SSLC”). ALC and SSLC are
                                        hereafter referred to collectively as “the
                                        defendants”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It was agreed on the first day of
                                        trial that this court would not be required to consider any
                                        issue of apportionment of liability between ALC and SSLC as
                                        this matter would be resolved between the firms. This was a
                                        sensible approach since the lawyer who had conduct of Suit
                                        630 throughout his time at ALC and SSLC was Mr A. Shahiran
                                        Anis bin Mohamad Ibrahim (“Mr Shahiran”). Mr
                                        Shahiran continued to have conduct of Suit 630 when he moved
                                        between the defendant firms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In this action, Sports Connection is
                                        represented by Mr Samuel Chacko (“Mr Chacko”)
                                        and counsel for the defendants is Mr Christopher Anand
                                        Daniel (“Mr Daniel”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview of the present proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The case that Sports Connection
                                        seeks to make here involves Mr Shahiran’s advice (or
                                        lack of advice) over a range of matters connected with
                                        Sports Connection’s assessment of damages in Suit 630.
                                        Sports Connection’s contention is that, owing to the
                                        defendants’ negligence, it lost the chance of
                                        recovering substantial damages in Suit 630. The defendants
                                        deny that their scope of duty included giving advice as
                                        pleaded, deny breach and causation, allege a failure to
                                        mitigate and also assert contributory negligence. To the
                                        defendants, Sports Connection had not shown that it had
                                        suffered loss as a result of the defendants’ alleged
                                        failure to give relevant advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As a matter of practicality, it is
                                        hardly straightforward to prove that a case which was lost
                                        after a full hearing would have been won if it had been
                                        conducted differently. Ultimately, this action will
                                        determine whether Sports Connection’s failure to
                                        recover substantial damages in the Suit 630 was really due
                                        to the defendants’ professional negligence, or whether
                                        it was a case where Sports Connection would not have
                                        recovered substantial damages in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Sports Connection’s complaints
                                        which formed the basis of its case against the defendants
                                        have been set out in broad and general terms in their
                                        pleadings even though they were crucial matters that would
                                        potentially fall for consideration. Sports Connection had
                                        advanced its case in both contract and tort. Insofar as
                                        Sports Connection argued that the same duty arose in
                                        contract because of an implied term of the retainer and in
                                        the tort of negligence, the analysis would be identical.
                                        This judgment will focus on the real issues in this case
                                        based on the basic principles of the law of
                                        negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Other than its averment in the
                                        pleadings that ALC took over the conduct of the assessment
                                        of damages in Suit 630 from N&amp;M in August 2006, there
                                        was no specific plea as to the precise scope and terms of
                                        the retainer save for an implied duty of skill and care in
                                        and about the conduct of Suit 630. Mr Daniel complained in
                                        the defendants’ Closing Submissions dated 30 January
                                        2015 that Sports Connection’s claim against the
                                        defendants “has not been clearly or precisely framed
                                        or pleaded”. Mr Chacko disagreed. He nonetheless
                                        endeavoured to set out the thrust of Sports
                                        Connection’s case in his Reply Submissions dated 16
                                        February 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I agree that if the pleadings,
                                        evidence and arguments had been more focussed and precise,
                                        the real issues in this case would have emerged clearer and
                                        earlier for everyone concerned. The identification of the
                                        real issues in this case and my conclusions on the real
                                        issues follow from the arguments and distillation of the
                                        pleadings, voluminous bundles of agreed documents and a fair
                                        amount of evidence bearing to varying degrees upon the
                                        points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As with most cases of professional
                                        negligence, the precise scope of the duty of skill and care
                                        established in the terms of engagement of the defendants to
                                        handle the litigation in Suit 630 is pivotal. In this
                                        regard, an important issue here is whether the
                                        defendants’ advice (or lack of advice) as pleaded fell
                                        below the standard of the reasonably competent lawyer. With
                                        this issue in mind, a good approach and starting point for
                                        this particular case is to ascertain what the non-negligent
                                        lawyer would have precisely advised in the particular
                                        circumstances in which the allegations of breach arose in
                                        order for this court to properly apply the relevant standard
                                        of the reasonably competent lawyer. Accordingly, Sports
                                        Connection has to establish the following matter: What
                                        advice in all the circumstances of the case would a
                                        reasonably competent lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran
                                        have given? This question will hereafter be referred to as
                                        “the proper advice argument”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     An analysis of how matters stood
                                        when the advice was supposedly given or omitted is
                                        necessary. This analysis is significant as: (a) the
                                        defendants cannot be liable for any error of judgment in the
                                        course of a lawsuit, and (b) the defendants’ conduct
                                        is not to be assessed with the benefit of hindsight. As Lord

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Lawyers are often faced with finely balanced
                                                problems. Diametrically opposed views may and not
                                                infrequently are taken by barristers and indeed by
                                                judges, each of whom has exercised reasonable, and

                                                be wrong certainly does not mean that he had been
                                                negligent. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Another important issue is
                                        causation. Was the advice (or lack of advice) as pleaded the
                                        reason for Sports Connection’s failure to recover
                                        substantial damages in Suit 630? In this regard, Sports
                                        Connection has to show a causal link between the
                                        defendants’ breach and the outcome of Suit 630. To
                                        show the relevant causal link, Sports Connection has to
                                        satisfy the court as to what action, if any, it would have
                                        taken to obtain the benefit or avoid the loss if the proper
                                        advice had been given. Put simply, the legal question that
                                        must be answered by Sports Connection is as follows: What
                                        action would Sports Connection, on a balance of probability,
                                        have taken if it had received proper advice? This question
                                        will hereafter be referred to as “the primary
                                        causation issue”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It must be remembered that the law
                                        of causation in the context of lawyers’ negligence
                                        makes a distinction between a case where the negligence
                                        consists of giving advice, which is either bad or wrong, and
                                        a case where the negligence consists of failure to advise
                                                (<em>ie</em>, an omission). In
                                        the case of an omission, causation depends on the
                                        hypothetical question of what Sports Connection would have
                                        done if the omission had not occurred. Although the question
                                        is a hypothetical one, it is well-established that Sports
                                        Connection has to prove on a balance of probability that it
                                        would have taken action to obtain the benefit or avoid the
                                        risk if proper advice had been given (see <em>Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons (a
                                                firm)</em> [1995] 1 WLR 1602
                                                (“<em>Allied
                                        Maples</em>”) at 1610) cited in <em>JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v

                                        Evidentially, this issue could be a matter of inference to
                                        be determined from all the circumstances of the case. Where
                                        the evidential burden has shifted to the defendants, the
                                        inference could be rebutted by objective evidence to prove
                                        that the omission was not causative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     A feature of the pleadings on the
                                        issue of causation requires mention. Sport
                                        Connection’s Statement of Claim averred as to what it
                                        would have done had it received proper advice in relation to
                                        its claim for damages against S&amp;N. The pleadings also
                                        asserted the “courses of action” supposedly
                                        opened to Sports Connection, for example, to halt and defer
                                        the Singapore Assessment pending completion of the
                                        assessment of damages in Malaysia in respect of an
                                        interlocutory judgment obtained in 2005 (see [30] below)
                                        (“the Malaysian Assessment”) and to use the
                                        amount adjudged in the Malaysian Assessment as evidence of
                                        Sports Connection’s loss. Mr Chacko argued that a
                                        final judgment obtained in the Malaysian Assessment would
                                        “constitute irrefutable and/or conclusive and/or
                                        persuasive evidence of Sports Connection’s
                                        losses” and as such it “would have been
                                        relevant to the Singapore Assessment and admissible as
                                        evidence in the Singapore Assessment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     This Judgment will examine whether
                                        the evidence of Sports Connection’s principal witness,
                                        Mr Yee, gave any indication as to what “courses of
                                        action” as pleaded he would in fact have adopted.
                                        Suffice to say for now that the evidence does not appear to
                                        support Sports Connection’s pleaded case. In fact, the
                                        state of affairs that emerged reveals that the pleaded
                                        “courses of action” were not available and
                                        viable as options, or if available as an option, it was not
                                        followed through for reasons that were independent of the
                                        defendants’ conduct (see [98]–[184]
                                        below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     By focusing on the two questions
                                        at [12] and [14] above (<em>ie</em>,
                                        the proper advice argument and the primary causation issue),
                                        and scrutinising the subsisting state of affairs at
                                        different stages of the litigation in Suit 630, the court
                                        would be in a position to decide if the loss which Sports
                                        Connection says it had suffered was in fact caused by the
                                        defendants’ alleged failure to give relevant
                                        advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Sports Connection formulated its
                                        claim (<em>ie</em>, loss that arose
                                        from Mr Shahiran’s advice (or lack of advice)) as the
                                        “loss of a chance” to recover more money in
                                        Suit 630 than was in fact recovered in respect of its
                                        various heads of claim against S&amp;N in Suit 630.
                                        Alternatively, if it had been so advised, Sports Connection
                                        claims there would have been a real or substantial chance
                                        that it would have accepted S&amp;N’s offer to settle
                                        dated 31 March 2008 (“the March OTS”) and,
                                        hence, the opportunity to obtain an amount higher than the
                                        sum that was eventually awarded in the Singapore Assessment.
                                        I pause here to note that this alternative plea in respect
                                        of the March OTS is directed against SSLC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     A real and fundamental question is
                                        whether the doctrine of loss of a chance should even apply
                                        to this case. This query is necessary because of: (a) the
                                        nature of the claims as pleaded; and (b) the legal
                                        requirements that need to be proved on a loss of chance
                                        analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In brief, applying <em>Allied Maples</em>, if the loss in
                                        question is not dependent on how a third party would have
                                        acted, it is not a loss of a chance case. In contrast, where
                                        the loss suffered depends on how a third party would have
                                        acted, either in addition to the action of Sports Connection
                                        or independently of it, the loss of chance analysis arises.
                                        Notably, this specific analysis arises only after the
                                        primary causation issue has been established, <em>ie</em>, that Sports Connection
                                        would, on the balance of probability, have acted in a
                                        certain way (<em>ie</em>, to avail
                                        itself of the chance) if advice had been given. In the
                                        analysis at this liability stage, the claim for loss of a
                                        chance is made out provided that Sports Connection shows
                                        that there was a real or substantial chance (rather than a
                                        negligible one) of the third party acting so as to confer
                                        the benefit on or avoid the loss suffered by Sports
                                        Connection. This consideration is distinct from the
                                        assessment of the value of the chance in the event that a
                                        real or substantial chance has been proved. The degree of
                                        the chance lost is a matter for the quantification of
                                        damages and this matter is held over now that the
                                        proceedings were ordered to be bifurcated; the trial before
                                        me only concerns the defendants’
                                liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is thus important to discuss
                                        the question of the proper method of analysing the claim for
                                        loss of a chance. This case also demonstrates how evidence
                                        of causation remains of significance in the identification
                                        and correlation of both: (a) the scope of the professional
                                        duty (which does not exist in the abstract) that was
                                        allegedly breached; and (b) what the breach of duty was in
                                        respect of recoverable loss as pleaded. In other words,
                                        evidence on causation will have a bearing on evidence that
                                        pertains to the pleaded “advice”, existence of
                                        duty in relation to the “advice” and breach.
                                        Recoverable loss is at the other end of the causal
                                        link.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Circumstances leading to Suit 630 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The genesis of this case stems
                                        from the failure of S&amp;N to register Sports
                                        Connection’s Trademark in Malaysia in 1991. The

                                        Malaysia between 1992 and 1996, Mr Kaw Ah Kin (“Mr

                                        were trading under the name of Evergreen Enterprises
                                        (“Evergreen”), managed to register themselves
                                        as the proprietors of the same trademark in Malaysia in
                                        1994. The Kaws also traded under the name of Outdoor
                                        Outfitters. The couple incorporated a company named Bodypac
                                        (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (“BM”) in July 1996 to sell
                                        Bodypac products supplied by Sports Connection to Outdoor
                                        Outfitters. Further, the Kaws sold counterfeit Bodypac
                                        products in Malaysia using BM as their vehicle after the
                                        supply of the Bodypac products from Sports Connection

                                        Connection thereafter incorporated Tearproof Sdn Bhd
                                        (“Tearproof”) in Malaysia in June 1997 to sell
                                        Bodypac products in Malaysia. Tearproof is effectively owned

                                        close to 18 years in Singapore and Malaysia. The following
                                        trademark infringement actions were started in Kuala Lumpur,

                                                23 October 1997. The action was for infringement and
                                                passing off, procuring breach of contract,
                                                intimidation and slander of goods. The counterclaim
                                                in Suit No D5-22-1079-1997 was brought by only
                                                Tearproof and it was against the KL parties for an
                                                injunction to restrain the sale of goods and an

                                                parties on 24 November 1997. This action mirrored
                                                the causes of action and relief sought in Suit No

                                        sued S&amp;N on 27 April 1999. Its heads of claim for
                                        damages in Suit 630 were for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     loss of profits due
                                                to the sale of Bodypac products in Malaysia by the

                                                litigation in Malaysia against the KL parties

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As the on-going KL Suits,
                                                <em>inter alia</em>, pertained
                                        to who was the rightful proprietor of the Trademark and who
                                        had infringed the Trademark, S&amp;N applied and
                                        successfully obtained an order to stay the proceedings in
                                        Suit 630 pending the resolution of the KL Suits. This stay
                                        order was granted on 15 October 1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Suit 630 was restored for hearing
                                        in May 2005. This was after Sports Connection obtained
                                        interlocutory judgment in the KL Suits with damages to be
                                        assessed on 28 January 2005 (“the KL Interlocutory
                                        Judgment”). Costs and interest were also ordered
                                        against the KL parties. Written grounds of the KL
                                        Interlocutory Judgment were released on 6 May
                                2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I pause to flag a point that was
                                        raised in this case on the relevance of assessing damages in
                                        Malaysia following the KL Interlocutory Judgment in order to
                                        aid Sports Connection’s claim for damages in Suit 630.
                                        Mr Shahiran’s case is that the damages ordered to be
                                        assessed in the KL Interlocutory Judgment pertained only to
                                        Tearproof and not Sports Connection and Mr Yee. I will come
                                        to his assertion later. Suffice to say for now that a closer
                                        scrutiny of the KL Interlocutory Judgment revealed that: (a)
                                        damages that were ordered to be assessed were in respect of
                                        the Counterclaim filed in Suit No D5-22-1079-1997; and (b)
                                        that Counterclaim was brought by Tearproof alone. Yet MCC
                                        reported to Mr Yee in an e-mail dated 28 January 2005 that
                                        in “respect of all 3 suits, the Judge also ordered
                                        damages to be paid by Kaw to you to be assessed by the
                                                Registrar.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The written grounds
                                        released by the Malaysian court on 6 May 2005 quite clearly
                                        stated that the order for damages to be assessed was in
                                        respect of Tearproof’s Counterclaim in Suit No
                                        D5-22-1079-1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Outcome of Suit 630</p>

                                        630. As stated, Sports Connection failed to recover
                                        substantial damages in the assessment of damages that was
                                        heard by Assistant Registrar Teo Guan Siew (“AR

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     As regards the Loss
                                                of Profits Claim, Sports Connection had not proved
                                                its loss; there were insufficient documents and
                                                evidence before the court to show that Sport
                                                Connection’s sale of Bodypac products was
                                                adversely affected by any competing sales of
                                                infringing products by BM. No damages were ordered

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     As regards the Legal Costs Claim, the

                                                Suits were determined at RM 418,375.50. Sports
                                                Connection, however, was only entitled to 30% of
                                                that amount as 70% of such costs ought to have been
                                                claimed by Sports Connection as party and party
                                                costs against the KL parties and not against

                                                sum of RM 160,512.65 was ordered under this head of

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Developments in Malaysia post-KL Interlocutory
                                Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     After the KL Interlocutory
                                        Judgment was released, the centre of litigation gravitated
                                        to Singapore. N&amp;M had Suit 630 restored for hearing and
                                        from then onwards Sports Connection turned its attention
                                        towards Suit 630. Significantly, the litigation front in
                                        Malaysia was limited to specific instructions to MCC to: (a)
                                        appeal one part of the KL Interlocutory Judgment; and (b)
                                        tax the party and party bill of costs in relation to the KL
                                        Interlocutory Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for point (b), Mr Yee wanted to
                                        bankrupt the Kaws and to do that Sports Connection was
                                        advised that it had to first obtain judgment for a
                                        quantified sum against the Kaws. Taxation of party and party
                                        costs was cheaper and distinctly a more cost-effective way
                                        to obtain an order for a quantified sum as compared to going
                                        through with an assessment of damages in Malaysia. Indeed,
                                        the contemporaneous documentation showed that Sports
                                        Connection chose taxation over assessment of damages.
                                        Factually, it cannot be disputed that no positive steps to
                                        assess damages before the Registrar of the Malaysian High
                                        Court in an assessment hearing were ever embarked upon until
                                        six years later in October 2011. By then, Sports Connection
                                        had failed to recover substantial damages in Suit 630 (see
                                        AR Teo’s decision released in January 2009, a summary
                                        of which is set out above at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     A common theme in this case is
                                        Sports Connection’s lateness or non-payment of
                                        professional fees. Mr Yee would cite overcharging and
                                        taxation of the Malaysian lawyers’ fees as reasons to
                                        hold back payment. That stance obviously affected Mr
                                        Yee’s relationship with his Malaysian lawyers who were
                                        naturally reluctant to give their full attention to Sports
                                        Connection’s matters. Even with the best will in the
                                        world, MCC’s outstanding professional fees would have
                                        somehow dictated the pace of MCC’s efforts to
                                        entertain and attend to Sports Connection and its
                                        matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I will deal with the specific
                                        instructions in turn before covering the events that halted
                                        the assessment of damages in Malaysia prior to
                                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appeal against one part of the KL Interlocutory

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Dissatisfied with the part of the
                                        KL Interlocutory Judgment that refused to record Sports

                                        trademark register, Sports Connection filed notice of appeal
                                        in 2005. In January 2010, Sports Connection’s appeal
                                        was dismissed with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Although notice of appeal was
                                        filed in 2005, it was not clear if the requisite appeal
                                        papers were ever filed by 20 April 2005 (which was the
                                        original deadline intimated by MCC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>). The progress of the
                                        appeal could have been held up for an appreciable length of
                                        time on account of MCC’s unpaid professional fees. It
                                        is not clear whether MCC completed work on the appeal in
                                        2007 except to say that the appeal was not disposed of until
                                        January 2010. It is Mr Shahiran’s evidence that he was
                                        not told of the appeal until receiving Mr Yee’s e-mail
                                        of 11 July 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Taxation of party and party costs of the KL Interlocutory
                                Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is quite clear from the
                                        correspondence that Mr Yee wanted to “finish
                                        off” Mr Kaw by bankrupting him after obtaining the KL
                                        Interlocutory Judgment. Mr Yee was advised by MCC, on 14
                                        June 2005, that before proceeding to bankrupt Mr Kaw, a
                                        quantified sum was required and the advice was to proceed to
                                        either assess damages, or tax party and party costs awarded
                                        in the KL Interlocutory Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Besides that route, it was also
                                        open to Mr Yee to bankrupt Mr Kaw via a different set of
                                        proceedings in Johor Bahru. This was Johor Bahru High Court
                                        CS No 22-136-1997 commenced by Sports Connection against Mr
                                        Kaw for a liquidated sum in respect of goods sold and
                                        delivered by Sports Connection to Mr Kaw in 2005
                                        (“the JB Suit”). Sports Connection’s
                                        lawyer in the JB Suit was one Shalini Sugumaran (“the
                                        JB lawyer”). I note that on 30 March 2006, the
                                        Malaysian High Court in Johor Bahru issued its judgment in
                                        respect of the JB Suit (“the JB Judgment”) and
                                        awarded Sports Connection a judgment sum of RM
                                        373,447.94.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On 4 August 2005, N&amp;M advised
                                        Mr Yee not to “slow down” in bankrupting Mr
                                        Kaw via the JB Judgment and went on to state:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We need a quick “liquidated” judgment to
                                                commence bankruptcy against Kaw Ah Kin and your KL
                                                case is not a liquidated claim whereas your JB
                                                matter is. So I do not think this “slowing
                                                down” will be beneficial to you.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The JB lawyer informed Mr Yee on
                                        20 December 2006 that the sealed copy of the JB Judgment had
                                        been extracted and before pressing on with the bankruptcy
                                        application against Mr Kaw, Sports Connection was first
                                        required to settle the JB lawyer’s legal fees. On 23
                                        January 2007, Mr Yee instructed the JB lawyer to “go
                                        ahead” even if the bankruptcy was not necessary for
                                        the Singapore Assessment as the cost was “only
                                                RM6k”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Apparently, Mr Yee’s
                                        realised from reading the JB lawyer’s letter of demand
                                        to Mr Kaw that the JB Judgment was against Mr Kaw and that
                                        it could not be used to bankrupt Ms Heng. He then instructed
                                        the JB lawyer to make Ms Heng a bankrupt using the KL
                                        Interlocutory Judgment. He gave that instructions to the JB
                                        lawyer as MCC were disinterested in doing more work after Mr
                                        Yee had expressed an intention to tax MCC’s bills.
                                        Understandably, the JB lawyer who had experienced late
                                        payment of his professional fees asked for a deposit of RM
                                        5,000 before proceeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On 12 June 2007, Mr Yee realised
                                        that it would make more sense to enforce the KL
                                        Interlocutory Judgment as that route would allow him to
                                        bankrupt both Mr Kaw and Ms Heng. He instructed the JB
                                        lawyer not proceed with making Mr Kaw a bankrupt on the JB
                                        Judgment. He e-mailed Mr Shahiran of this development. He
                                        also e-mailed MCC’s Mr Kenneth St James (“Mr
                                        KSJ”), instructing him to enforce the KL
                                        Interlocutory Judgment. Instructions to the same effect were
                                        again repeated in an e-mail dated 25 June 2007 wherein Mr
                                        Yee explained that he needed “to show this bankrupt
                                        proceedings to the [Registrar]/Court of
                                                Singapore”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In July 2007, Mr KSJ advised Mr
                                        Yee again that an order for a quantified sum was required
                                        and that bankruptcy proceedings could be approached via: (a)
                                        taxation of the party and party costs in the KL Suits; or
                                        (b) assessment of damages in respect of the KL Interlocutory
                                        Judgment (<em>ie</em>, the Malaysian
                                        Assessment). Whilst Mr KSJ asked for express instructions as
                                        to whether he should proceed with the Malaysian Assessment
                                        and/or the taxation of party and party costs, Mr Yee was
                                        reminded of MCC’s unpaid bills and that work would be
                                        put on hold until MCC’s bills were settled. Mr Yee
                                        gave Mr KSJ approval to go ahead to make Mr Kaw a bankrupt
                                        on 10 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I digress to point out MCC’s
                                        chaser to Mr Yee for payment of its professional fees, and
                                        Mr KSJ’s e-mail on 21 November 2006 where he asked to
                                        meet Mr Yee to discuss three outstanding matters, namely,
                                        Sports Connection’s appeal to the Court of Appeal,
                                        assessment of damages and enforcement of the costs order in
                                        the KL Interlocutory Judgment. As regards the matter of
                                        assessment of damages, Mr Yee’s reply to Mr KSJ on 29
                                        November 2006 was that he did not require Mr KSJ’s
                                        assistance because he had engaged an expert witness from
                                        Deloitte &amp; Touche Financial Advisory Services Pte Ltd
                                        (“Deloitte”) to assist in quantifying the Loss
                                        of Profits Claim for the Singapore Assessment. At the same
                                        time, it must be remembered that Mr Yee had already obtained
                                        the JB Judgment and the standing instruction to the JB
                                        lawyer was to bankrupt Mr Kaw. Mr Yee’s reply to Mr
                                        KSJ on 29 November 2006 stated rhetorically that taxation of
                                        costs order against Mr Kaw would be “futile”
                                        since Sports Connection’s immediate intention was to
                                        bankrupt Mr Kaw. For convenience, I set out Mr Yee’s
                                        reply of 29 November 2006 in italics: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

                                        sought clarification of Mr Yee’s instructions of 10
                                        July 2007. There was a telephone conference involving Mr
                                        Shahiran, Mr KSJ and Mr Yee on 2 August 2007, and it was
                                        during that conference call that Mr KSJ received instruction
                                        to bankrupt Mr Kaw by taxing the party and party costs
                                        instead of proceeding via the Malaysian Assessment. Mr KSJ
                                        e-mailed Mr Yee to confirm his instructions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>

                                        for an update of the bankruptcy proceedings in Kuala Lumpur.
                                        He was informed by Mr KSJ that MCC was still in the midst of
                                        preparing the bill of costs, which would take some time as
                                        there were numerous proceedings spanning eight years. Mr Yee
                                        forwarded this reply to Mr Shahiran for his
                                        information.</p>

                                        costs. On 26 August 2008, Mr KSJ informed Mr Yee that he was
                                        unable to serve the bill of costs on Mr Kaw and Ms Heng, and
                                        was only able to serve it on BM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Eventually, taxation of the party
                                        and party costs took place on 17 September 2008 in the
                                        absence of Mr Kaw, Ms Heng and BM. The Assistant
                                        Registrar’s decision of 15 October 2005 awarded taxed
                                        costs of RM 152,688.50 to Sports Connection, Tearproof and
                                        Mr Yee with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum to

                                        Interlocutory Judgment until the date of payment. The taxed
                                        costs were not produced at the Singapore Assessment in
                                        November 2008 which led to AR Teo’s finding as set out
                                        at [33(b)] above.</p>

                                        Connection on 16 October 2008, Mr KSJ opined that the amount
                                        of taxed costs was “way too low and
                                        insufficient” and recommended that the amount be put

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further to the above, kindly recall that your Mr. Yee
                                                has never issued instructions (i.e. that is until
                                                very recently) that taxation was being undertaken
                                                against the Defendants in the Malaysian matter.
                                                Kindly recall that Mr. Rajan Navaratnam was
                                                instructed to Bankrupt one of the said Defendants.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the circumstances, please let us know whether we
                                                may have the documents mentioned on an URGENT basis.
                                                This matter is due to be heard shortly in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For reasons that are not entirely
                                        clear, there was renewed interest in bankrupting Mr Kaw via
                                        the JB Judgment after Mr Yee’s earlier instructions to
                                        the JB lawyer to bankrupt Mr Kaw had stalled for non-payment
                                        of legal fees and the provision of funds to proceed with the
                                        bankruptcy application. In or around June 2008, a different
                                        lawyer, one Mr Rajan Navaratnam (“Mr Rajan”),
                                        was engaged by Sports Connection to commence bankruptcy
                                        proceedings against Mr Kaw for non-payment of the JB
                                        Judgment. Mr Rajan agreed to proceed but Sports Connection
                                        was required to remit a deposit of RM 3,850 for
                                        disbursements. Mr Yee agreed to pay on receipt of the
                                        lawyer’s invoice. On 4 November 2008, Mr Rajan sent a
                                        letter to SSLC, stating that he had not served the
                                        bankruptcy notice as he was still trying to determine Mr
                                        Kaw’s latest address of service. By this time, the
                                        Singapore Assessment was already underway.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     For completeness, Mr Kaw was made
                                        a bankrupt on 9 June 2009 by a creditor bank. Ms Heng was
                                        made a bankrupt on 11 September 2013 by Sports
                                        Connection.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No positive steps were taken to assess damages in

                                        Judgment was handed down on 28 January 2005, there was talk
                                        between MCC and Mr Yee about taking steps to assess damages
                                        against the KL parties. The idea in the early days
                                                (<em>ie</em>, 2005) was for the
                                        Malaysian Assessment to proceed concurrently with the
                                        Singapore Assessment. Hence, there were exchanges of e-mails
                                        between MCC and N&amp;M where MCC in an e-mail dated 14 June
                                        2005 promised to attend to the assessment of damages in the
                                        KL Suits “in due course”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Prior to that, Mr

                                        “try to keep up” with Suit 630 given the
                                        faster pace of proceedings in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> There was also a

                                        wanted, in particular, MCC’s formula to compute

                                                  assessment of damages, I was unsure. I didn't have
                                                  a clear -- clear instructions. So let the
                                                  Singapore lawyers do what they need to do, and let
                                                  -- don't let them – in other words, I was

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I have already mentioned
                                        MCC’s unpaid bills and Mr Yee’s November 2006
                                        reply set out at [47] above to which I refer for context. By
                                        November 2006, Mr Yee did not require MCC to take steps to
                                        assess damages or come up with a formula to compute
                                        damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I mentioned earlier in [45] above
                                        that on 12 June 2007, Mr Yee realised that it would make
                                        more sense to enforce the KL Interlocutory Judgment as that
                                        route would allow him to bankrupt Ms Heng. I have also
                                        mentioned that Mr Yee instructed Mr KSJ to execute
                                        bankruptcy proceedings against the KL parties in an e-mail
                                        dated 25 June 2007 wherein Mr Yee explained that he needed
                                        “to show this bankrupt proceedings to the
                                        [Registrar]/Court of Singapore”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     MCC’s bills were still not
                                        paid. Mr KSJ informed Mr Yee in July 2007 that work at his
                                        end was held up because MCC’s professional fees were
                                        not paid. Thereafter on 2 August 2007, specific instructions
                                        to tax the party and party bill instead of proceeding with
                                        the assessment of damages in Malaysia were given to
                                        MCC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The events that happened showed
                                        quite clearly when, why and how the topic of bankrupting Mr
                                        Kaw via taxation of party and party costs came up. That
                                        route was seen to be a cheaper and more cost-effective way
                                        to obtain an order for a quantified sum as compared to going
                                        through with an assessment of damages. At that time, the
                                        objective was to bankrupt the Kaws and to do that Sports
                                        Connection had to first obtain an order for a quantified sum
                                        against the Kaws. Indeed, the contemporaneous documentation
                                        showed that Sports Connection chose taxation over assessment
                                        of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Chronologically, the Malaysian
                                        Assessment was left dormant since the KL Interlocutory
                                        Judgment was pronounced in January 2005. On 27 April 2011,
                                        the defendants were told that Sport Connection intended to
                                        sue for negligence in respect of the defendants’
                                        failure to advise Sports Connection to proceed with the
                                        Malaysian Assessment. Sports Connection’s purpose of
                                        reviving the Malaysian Assessment was to claim as damages in
                                        this action the amounts awarded to Sport Connection in the
                                        Malaysian Assessment.</p>

                                        Assessment was unchallenged. It proceeded in the absence of

                                        adjudicated a bankrupt on 9 June 2009), in the absence of Ms

                                        2012, reliance was placed on the expert report of Ferrier
                                        Hodgson, Malaysia. According to Mr Shahiran, the
                                        expert’s report: (a) did not contain additional and
                                        relevant documents from BM; and (b) included the JB Judgment

                                        and that was erroneous as the JB Judgment was distinct from

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Sports Connection blamed Mr
                                        Shahiran for not advising it to assess damages in Malaysia
                                        before the hearing of the Singapore Assessment in Suit 630.
                                        I have already recounted the reasons as to why the Malaysian
                                        Assessment was left dormant and it is against that backdrop
                                        that Sports Connection’s allegations that Mr Shahiran
                                        in the conduct of Suit 630 did not advise on the following
                                        matters must be examined. The alleged failures to advise
                                        were as follows:</p>

                                        Connection has to make involves: (a) negligent advice; (b)
                                        establishing what Sports Connection would have done if
                                        advice had been given; and (c) if it is established that
                                        Sports Connection would have acted in a certain way but the
                                        question whether loss has been suffered depends on how third
                                        parties would have acted, the question becomes whether
                                        Sports Connection lost a chance. Chances that are regarded
                                        as real or substantial will suffice; those that are
                                        negligible will be ignored. The court’s task is to do
                                        its best to place the chance within its proper range given
                                        the wide spectrum where certainty of a chance falls on the
                                        extreme end of the spectrum and a chance which is nil or
                                        negligible falls at the other end.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     On the basis of the approach in
                                                <em>Allied Maples</em>, the
                                        losses in items (d) and (e) above (at [70]) are not
                                        dependent on how a third party would have acted and they
                                        are, therefore, not “loss of a chance” claims.
                                        Instead, Sports Connection’s loss depends on what
                                        Sports Connection would have done if advice had been given.
                                        The primary causation issue is whether Sports Connection
                                        would have accepted the March OTS and not proceeded with the
                                        Singapore Assessment if it had received the advice it
                                        claimed that SSLC omitted to give. Sports Connection has to
                                        show on a balance of probability that <em>but
                                                for</em> Mr Shahiran’s breach, it would

                                        above at [70], the issue of proof of loss of a chance is the
                                        “real and substantial chance” analysis and
                                        this arises if it is first established, on a balance of
                                        probability, that Sports Connection would have acted in a
                                        certain way had the relevant advice been given. I will
                                        elaborate on this below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What must be proved on a loss of chance
                                analysis?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Apart from a denial that the
                                        defendants were under any duty to give advice as set out
                                        above at [68], for matters of causation and damage, Mr
                                        Daniel’s main focus was that Sports Connection had not
                                        established any loss. Having failed to do so, the causal
                                        link between the alleged failure to give advice and loss as
                                        a result of the failure to give relevant advice is missing.
                                        The analysis goes further as causation is dependent on what
                                        would have happened if Sports Connection had been given the
                                        alleged advice. The claim for a loss of a chance arises: (a)
                                        if it is established that Sports Connection would have acted
                                        in a certain way; and (b) the question whether loss has been
                                        suffered depends on how third parties would have
                                        acted.</p>

                                                necessary to consider as a matter of law what it is

                                        warranty by the vendor that its subsidiary had no
                                        outstanding contingencies or liabilities. During the course
                                        of negotiations, the defendants negligently allowed the
                                        clause to be amended in such a way that it no longer had its
                                        effect as a warranty as originally intended by the
                                        plaintiffs. After the agreement was entered into, the
                                        subsidiary (now belonging to the plaintiffs) faced
                                        substantial liabilities which would have been covered by the
                                        warranty had the defendants not negligently allowed the
                                        amendment. The plaintiffs therefore brought an action
                                        against the defendants. On appeal, Stuart-Smith LJ in the
                                        English Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs had to
                                        prove on the balance of probability that if they had been
                                        given the right advice, they would have sought to negotiate
                                        further with Mr Gillow to obtain protection (at 1610). Once
                                        that was proved, it was not necessary to go further to prove
                                        that Mr Gillow would, on the balance of probability, have
                                        acted to confer on the plaintiffs the benefit of the
                                        warranty. It was sufficient that the chance (<em>ie</em>, the chance that they would
                                        have successfully negotiated for total or partial
                                        protection) was a real or substantial one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In <em>JSI
                                                Shipping</em>, our Court of Appeal also
                                        applied this proposition. The plaintiff’s complaint in
                                        that case was also one of negligence – the plaintiff
                                        sued the defendant-auditors for negligently auditing the
                                        accounts, allowing its Asia Director to siphon off
                                        substantial amounts of funds. One of the plaintiff’s
                                        claims was for loss of chance to recover the sums
                                        misappropriated or to prevent further misappropriation. The
                                        Court of Appeal stated that in order to avail itself of this
                                        claim, the plaintiff had to prove on the balance of
                                        probability that if the defendants had not been negligent,
                                        it would have taken the necessary steps to investigate the
                                        matter (at [148]). One reason why the Court of Appeal held
                                        that this had not been proved was because the
                                        plaintiff’s other director had not even read the audit
                                        report which the plaintiff complained was negligently
                                        prepared. To that extent, it was in fact this
                                        director’s “general indifference” and
                                        “laxity in management” which lead to the
                                        misappropriation; in other words, it was not proved on the
                                        balance of probability that the plaintiff would have put in
                                        measures to avail itself of a chance of discovery,
                                        prevention or recovery (see
                                [147]–[156]).</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… As I see it, one must initially ask whether
                                                the claimant would, in fact, have proceeded with the
                                                action, had he not been deprived of the right to
                                                bring it. After all, one is concerned with the loss
                                                which the claimant has suffered, and, for the
                                                reasons I have given, this cannot, at least
                                                normally, involve a market value exercise: generally
                                                it is only the claimant who could have brought the
                                                action, and, without his having done so, there would
                                                be no opportunity to recover damages. In my
                                                judgment, therefore, unless the point is conceded by
                                                the defendant in a particular case (and in most
                                                cases I suspect that it will be), the first question
                                                to be considered is whether the claimant would
                                                actually have pursued the action to the point where
                                                he would, subject to the court’s assessment of
                                                the prospects, have recovered something. Applying
                                                normal principles, it is for the claimant to satisfy
                                                the court that he would have pursued the action to
                                                that extent, albeit only on the balance of
                                                probabilities. If the claimant fails at that point,
                                                that is the end of the matter. If he succeeds, it is
                                                necessary to turn to the second question, namely
                                                what would have happened if the claimant had pursued
                                                the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does the loss of chance analysis apply on the facts to
                                the Loss of Profits and Legal Costs Claims?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     An interesting approach to the
                                        loss of chance analysis advanced by Sarah Green in <em>Causation in Negligence</em> (Hart
                                        Publishing, 2015) (“<em>Causation in
                                                Negligence</em>”) is to distinguish
                                        between chances that are interlinked with the breach and
                                        those that exist independently of the breach of duty. In
                                        short, the distinction is between independent and
                                        interdependent chances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I begin the analysis by referring
                                        to cases where the English Courts have declined to recognise
                                        loss of chance as an appropriate head of claim in medical
                                        negligence cases. In <em>Gregg v
                                                Scott</em> [2005] 2 WLR 268 (“<em>Gregg v Scott</em>”), the
                                        claimant developed a lump under his left arm, whereupon he
                                        attended at the defendant’s medical practice, and was
                                        told by the defendant that it was benign and needed no
                                        further action. Subsequently, he saw another doctor, and it
                                        was discovered that the tumour was in fact cancerous and had
                                        spread to his chest. The claimant sued the defendant in
                                        negligence, claiming recovery for the loss of chance to have
                                        a better prospect of recovery if he was diagnosed earlier.
                                        The trial judge found that even if the defendant had
                                        accurately diagnosed the cancer earlier, the claimant would
                                        only have a 42% chance of cure (defined as surviving for
                                        more than ten years). The expert evidence was that the delay
                                        in the diagnosis reduced the claimant’s chance of cure
                                        from 42% to 25%. The trial judge held that because the
                                        claimant would not have been cured anyway, the delay had not
                                        deprived the claimant of the prospect of a cure and
                                        dismissed the claimant’s action.</p>

                                        of chance because the claimant had not shown on the balance
                                        of probability that the defendant had caused the adverse
                                        health consequences; the claimant had, at all times, at

                                                produce a favourable outcome. In the latter class,
                                                he may recover for loss of chance that the third
                                                party would have so acted. This apparent arbitrary
                                                distinction obviously rests on grounds of policy. In
                                                addition, most of the cases in which there has been
                                                recovery for loss of chance have involved financial
                                                loss, where the chance can itself plausibly be
                                                characterised as an item of property, like a lottery
                                                ticket. … [emphasis added]</p>

                                                  because the breach affects the existence and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     On this analysis, Type 1 cases are
                                        therefore cases like <em>Allied
                                                Maples</em> and <em>Asia Hotel
                                                Investments</em> where the chance is
                                        independent of the defendant’s breach. In <em>Allied Maples</em>, the
                                        plaintiff’s chance of a successful negotiation with Mr
                                        Gillow was independent of the defendant’s breach in
                                        failing to include the warranty. Similarly, in <em>Asia Hotel Investments</em> –
                                        which I should highlight was a contract case – the
                                        plaintiff’s chance of obtaining the benefit sought
                                        (being a certain stake in the Grand Pacific Hotel) subsisted
                                        independently of the defendant’s breach of a
                                        non-circumvention agreement (“NCA”). The
                                        defendant’s breach of the NCA did not decrease the
                                        plaintiff’s chances of obtaining the stake, but erased
                                        it. In both cases, the defendant’s breach, on the
                                        balance of probability, caused the relevant chance to be
                                        lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In Type 2 cases however, the
                                        chance is interlinked with the breach. Thus, in <em>Gregg v Scott</em>, the probability
                                        of whether the claimant could be cured was already latent in
                                        the claimant – the defendant’s failure to
                                        accurately diagnose the condition affected the
                                        claimant’s probability of cure by decreasing it.
                                        However, no independent chance was lost. To claim for loss
                                        of chance in such a case is to beg the question as to
                                        whether a chance in fact existed. Sarah Green explains (p
                                        164–165):</p>

                                                whom there is a less-than-evens chance that they

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Allied Maples</em>, for
                                                example, the claimants’ relationship with
                                                their solicitors had no influence whatsoever on the
                                                content of the chance of their being able to elicit
                                                concessions from their vendor in the hypothetical

                                                important to establish there was whether, on the
                                                balance of probabilities, the defendant had in fact
                                                denied the claimants the opportunity to take
                                                advantage of such a chance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This sort of conclusion is not one, however, which can
                                                be made on the basis of Type 2 factual scenarios
                                                because, in these situations, there is no such thing
                                                as an independently quantifiable opportunity which
                                                can be divorced from the question of whether the
                                                defendant’s breach made the claimant worse
                                                off. In the Type 2 cases of [<em>Gregg v Scott</em>] … , for
                                                instance, the claimants’ chances of avoiding
                                                an adverse physical outcome were inextricably bound
                                                up with the effects of the defendant’s
                                                negligent diagnosis. The relevant
                                                “chance” therefore is not assessable
                                                independently of the breach, since it is defined and
                                                determined by it. <em>Given that
                                                  there is nothing extraneous from which the

                                                  defendant’s breach deprived her of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The author thus concludes that
                                        while Type 1 cases are true loss of chance cases, Type 2
                                        cases are not true loss of chance cases, as there is no
                                        independent chance which could have been lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In the present case, however, the
                                        complaint is not that an independent chance of succeeding at
                                        the Singapore Assessment had been lost, although it is
                                        couched as such. If one examines the claim and the facts in
                                        closer detail, the chance is not in fact independent of the
                                        defendants’ breach. Sports Connection’s true
                                        complaint is that if not for the defendants’ breach,
                                        it would have had X% chance of success, but because of the
                                        breach, it had (X-Y)% chance of success instead. As the loss
                                        in fact eventuated, the legally relevant question must be
                                        the extent to which the defendants’ alleged breach
                                        caused that loss. From this perspective, Sports
                                        Connection’s case falls squarely into the Type 2
                                        situation advocated by Sarah Green. As a Type 2 case, Sports
                                        Connection must show, on a balance of probability, that but
                                        for the defendants’ breach, it would have obtained a
                                        more favourable outcome at trial. This is the conventional
                                        analysis of “but for” causation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     If Sports Connection’s
                                        claims were bad to begin with (defined as having a less than
                                        50% chance of success), it is not clear why it should be
                                        indemnified for the loss of any percentage chance of that
                                        success from its allegedly negligent solicitors, since the
                                        failure at the Singapore Assessment, on a balance of
                                        probability, would be more likely to be due to the fact that
                                        the claim was bad, rather than the defendants’
                                        negligence. I am mindful that no case was pleaded that Mr
                                        Yee in fact thought the claim for damages in Suit 630 was
                                        hopeless but Mr Shahiran failed to advise Mr Yee
                                        accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I say no more about this matter as
                                        the parties are in agreement as to the basis of a loss of
                                        chance analysis. Nevertheless, it is open to this court to
                                        examine whether on the evidence the claim for loss of a
                                        chance in this particular case in fact existed. Given the
                                        spectrum of chances, where certainty of chance is at one end
                                        and nil or negligible chance is at the other extreme end,
                                        the court’s task is to do its best to place the
                                        alleged chance within its proper range. It seems to me that
                                        the arguments on loss of chance in this case are premised on
                                        “a chance upon a chance” and that begs the
                                        question as to whether a “real chance” in fact
                                        existed. I use the words “real chance” because
                                        that reflects the language used by Stuart-Smith LJ in
                                                <em>Allied Maples</em>.
                                        Clearly, a chance upon a chance is not a real
                                chance.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The question whether Sports
                                        Connection lost a chance of being better off financially
                                        than it did as a result Mr Shahiran’s advice on the
                                        litigation in the Singapore Assessment depends on many
                                        questions of chances at different stages. In the end, what
                                        has to be considered is the real chance of Sports Connection
                                        being financially better off than what it got in the
                                        Singapore Assessment if the advice as pleaded had been
                                        given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Sports Connection has put its case
                                        for loss of a chance to recover its claim for loss of
                                        profits in a way that is illustrative of the many questions
                                        of chances that can arise at different stages. For example,
                                        what chance would Sports Connection have had of staying the
                                        Singapore Assessment? What chance would Sports Connection
                                        have had of proceeding with the Malaysian Assessment without
                                        staying the Singapore Assessment? What chance would Sports
                                        Connection have had of assessing damages in its name back in
                                        2006 to 2008 when the counterclaim for damages in the KL
                                        Suits was brought only by Tearproof and not Sports
                                        Connection and Mr Yee, and that the decision of the
                                        Malaysian Judge on damages was in favour of Tearproof? What
                                        was the chance of the Malaysian Assessment going ahead
                                        uncontested in 2006 to 2008? The Malaysian Assessment in
                                        2012 was not contested because the KL parties did not show
                                        up at the hearing. By then BM was wound up and Mr Kaw was
                                        already a bankrupt. All these questions bring into focus a
                                        case of “a chance upon a chance” that would
                                        render Sports Connection’s claims formulated on
                                        “loss of a chance” (based on the likely
                                        actions of third parties) completely uncertain and hence
                                        fanciful.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In brief, Sports Connection blamed
                                        Mr Shahiran for not advising it to assess damages in
                                        Malaysia before the hearing of the Singapore Assessment in
                                        Suit 630, given “the paucity of supporting
                                        evidence”, an expression used by Mr Chacko. Sports
                                        Connection’s case is that Mr Shahiran should have
                                        given such advice while he had conduct of the Singapore
                                        Assessment. Crucially, there were various opportunities for
                                        Mr Shahiran to have rendered this advice, such as when
                                        various expert reports were produced. Significantly, an
                                        analysis of how matters stood when the advice was supposedly
                                        omitted is pivotal, and I will go through this point in
                                        detail below. The Statement of Claim averred to what Sports
                                        Connection would have done had it received proper advice in
                                        relation to its claim for damages against S&amp;N. The
                                        omission was “to advise” on, what I have
                                        termed, “courses of action” supposedly open to
                                        Sports Connection to take and which Sports Connection would
                                        have taken if advice had been given. I have set out the two
                                        main “courses of action” pleaded in the
                                        Statement of Claim at [68] above. For convenience, I repeat
                                        them here:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     Course of Action 1:
                                                To stay the Singapore Assessment pending completion
                                                of the Malaysia Assessment, and to thereafter
                                                present the amount assessed in the Malaysian
                                                Assessment as evidence of Sports Connection’s
                                                claim for loss of profit in the Singapore
                                                Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     Course of Action 2: That in the
                                                Malaysian Assessment, it could have “obtained
                                                evidence in discovery and/or affidavit evidence from
                                                the [the KL parties] which would have been useful
                                                for and relevant to the Singapore
                                                Assessment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     All in all, Sports Connection must
                                        satisfy three conditions in its claim for negligence and
                                        breach of retainer in the conduct of Suit 630. The first
                                        condition is the proper advice argument which is whether the
                                        defendants’ advice (or lack of advice) as pleaded fell
                                        below the standard of the reasonably competent lawyer. The
                                        critical question, which has been set out at [12] above is,
                                        what advice in all the circumstances of the case would a
                                        reasonably competent lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran
                                        have given?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The second condition is the
                                        primary causation issue. As stated at [14] above, the legal
                                        question that must be answered by Sports Connection is as
                                        follows: what action would Sports Connection on a balance of
                                        probability have taken if it had received proper
                                        advice?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     With these two conditions
                                        analysed, the court is well placed to examine the third
                                        condition, <em>viz</em>, whether the
                                        loss which Sports Connection claimed that it had suffered
                                        was in fact caused by the failure to give the relevant
                                        advice. This collective approach as outlined was explained
                                        by Slade LJ in <em>Boateng v Hughmans (a
                                                firm)</em> [2002] EWCA Civ 593 at [35], and I
                                        gratefully adopt the explanation and approach in this
                                        particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As alluded to earlier, the
                                        evidence and arguments in this case are closely intertwined
                                        in that matters pertaining to the core issue of causation
                                        have a significant bearing on all the other issues of
                                        negligence and vice versa. I propose to examine the evidence
                                        that is common to issues of scope of duty, breach, causation
                                        and loss before returning to answer the three specific
                                        conditions above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     An analysis of the common features
                                        of this case foreshadows at an early stage the flaw that
                                        underlines the Loss of Profits Claim. In fact, the state of
                                        affairs that emerged is tellingly simple: in the particular
                                        circumstances of the case, the pleaded Courses of Action
                                        were illusory and fanciful to qualify as
                                        “advice” that would fall within Mr
                                        Shahiran’s scope of duty for no reasonably competent
                                        lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran would have advised
                                        Sports Connection to take them.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Right from the time Sports
                                        Connection restored Suit 630 for hearing in May 2005, it
                                        experienced tremendous difficulties gathering relevant
                                        documents and information to substantiate its Loss of
                                        Profits Claim. For over three years, delays were encountered
                                        so often that deadlines to give discovery of documents and
                                        furnish proper answers to Further and Better Particulars
                                        requested by S&amp;N had to be repeatedly extended.
                                        Consequently, trial dates were vacated no less than six
                                        times. The state of the documentary evidence remained
                                        incomplete to the very end in November 2008. The state of
                                        affairs subsisting at different periods in time demonstrated
                                        that Mr Yee was, and I so find, fully aware that documents
                                        bearing upon Sports Connection’s Loss of Profits Claim
                                        were incomplete to substantiate its claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Initially, Sports Connection
                                        cobbled together an exaggerated claim amount of S$38m as the
                                        quantum of its Loss of Profits Claim. This was in February
                                        2006. It was a figure that Mr Yee knew could not be
                                        supported. He was told by Sports Connection’s auditor,
                                        Mr Dickson Poon, that some of the numbers that his firm had
                                        used to put forward this quantum of S$38m were either not
                                        audited or verified.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> By
                                        February 2007, the claim figure of S$38m was drastically
                                        reduced to between S$1,762,649 and S$1,958,499 by its expert
                                        witness, Mr Tam Chee Chong (“Mr Tam”) of
                                        Deloitte. After Mr Shahiran took over the conduct of Suit
                                        630 in August 2006, Deloitte was appointed “to
                                        quantify [Sports Connection’s] loss of profit in

                                        criticised by Mr Foong Daw Ching (“Mr Foong”)
                                        of Baker Tilly Consultancy (S) Pte Ltd, S&amp;N’s
                                        expert who looked into the Loss of Profits Claim. In the
                                        Baker Tilly Report dated 15 October 2007 (“Baker
                                        Tilly Report”), Mr Foong opined that there was
                                        nothing in the disclosed documents that could be used
                                        meaningfully to assess the Loss of Profits Claim. At the
                                        Singapore Assessment, AR Teo agreed with Mr Foong’s
                                        testimony, amongst other things, and dismissed Sports
                                        Connection’s entire claim for Loss of
                                Profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    It was against this backdrop of
                                        AR Teo’s findings outlined above that Mr Yee argued
                                        that Mr Shahiran was negligent in not advising Sports
                                        Connection to stay the Singapore Assessment and proceed with
                                        the Malaysian Assessment first. In substance, the picture
                                        that emerged revealed that Sports Connection’s plea
                                        that Mr Shahiran ought to have advised Sports Connection to
                                        take the Courses of Action as pleaded were not, in light of
                                        the evidence, feasible and viable Courses of Action. Based
                                        on the evidence, suffice to say for now that the so-called
                                        Courses of Action were illusory and fanciful and could
                                        hardly be said to be “advice” that would fall
                                        within Mr Shahiran’s scope of duty for no reasonably
                                        competent lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran would have
                                        advised Sports Connection to take them. I will elaborate on

                                        Singapore when he ignored e-mails from Mr Yee and Mr Netto
                                        on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    I note that given the
                                        difficulties in substantiating the Loss of Profits Claim, Mr
                                        Yee accepted in two e-mails of 21 October 2005 that the loss
                                        was Tearproof’s rather than Sports
                                                Connection’s.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In the background, S&amp;N was
                                        similarly asking for Evergreen’s documents, amongst
                                        others. On 5 July 2005, Messrs Rajah &amp; Tann
                                        (“R&amp;T”) representing S&amp;N sought
                                        discovery of documentary evidence in support of Sports
                                        Connection’s Loss of Profits Claim due to the sale of
                                        Bodypac products in Malaysia by the KL parties. R&amp;T
                                        required discovery by 19 July 2005, a deadline which N&amp;M
                                        agreed to. However, Sports Connection was not able to meet
                                        that deadline, and on 21 July 2005, N&amp;M told R&amp;T
                                        that “there has been a delay caused by our
                                        client’s attempts to obtain certain document[s] from

                                        discovery by 27 July 2005. The discovered list of documents
                                        was found to be incomplete even though the list was said to
                                        be the “best” that Sports Connection could

                                        Dissatisfied, R&amp;T sought specific discovery of documents
                                        on 3 August 2005. The categories of documents included the

                                        Loss of Profits Claim and the Legal Costs Claim. That

                                        how such profits were arrived at. Sports Connection was

                                2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Sports Connection served its

                                        was appointed, on 28 November 2005, to help quantify the

                                        and expected costs of sales as well as what Mr Yee could

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Mr Shahiran took over conduct of
                                        Suit 630 on 15 August 2006. By that time, directions given
                                        at PTC held on 3 August 2006 were, <em>inter
                                                alia</em>, as follows: (a) Affidavits of
                                        Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) of factual and
                                        expert witnesses to be exchanged by 28 September 2006; and
                                        (b) two days set aside in the week of 20 November 2006 for
                                        the hearing of assessment of damages. On Mr Shahiran’s
                                        advice, Mr Tam was appointed as Sports Connection’s
                                        expert witness to quantify Sports Connection’s loss of
                                        profits in relation to the Malaysian market for sales of
                                        Bodypac products for the period 1994 to 2004. That
                                        appointment was made more than one year after S&amp;N
                                        consented to liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    At the time of Mr Tam’s
                                        appointment, the court’s directions required Sports
                                        Connection to produce the expert report and expert’s
                                        AEIC by 22 September 2006. Unsurprisingly, Deloitte required
                                        an extension of the 22 September 2006 deadline in light of
                                        the scope of work that it had to undertake. Mr Shahiran
                                        applied for an extension of time on 26 September 2006 and
                                        the court extended the time for the filing of
                                        Deloitte’s Report to 24 November 2006. The trial was
                                        also re-fixed to 12 and 13 of February 2007. As we now know,
                                        this new deadline was difficult for Deloitte to meet for the
                                        reasons discussed below. The deadline was duly extended to
                                        28 February 2007 on 24 November 2006 pursuant to another
                                        application taken out by Mr Shahiran. Consequently, trial
                                        dates in February 2007 were vacated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    On 30 October 2006, R&amp;T
                                        wrote to Mr Shahiran, requesting further particulars of
                                        Sports Connection’s Statement of Claim as it was of
                                        the view that the particulars provided by Sports Connection
                                        on 28 February 2006 (while N&amp;M was still Sports
                                        Connection’s solicitors) were insufficient. These
                                        requests included, but were not limited to: (a) details of
                                        Evergreen’s profits; and (b) details of how the loss
                                        of goodwill claim was computed. R&amp;T also took the view
                                        that Sports Connection had not complied with its discovery
                                        obligations. In particular, Sports Connection had not
                                        disclosed certain pages from its annual financial reports as
                                        well as its income tax documents from 1991 to

                                        comment that the Further and Better Particulars dated 28
                                        February 2006 had become nugatory. R&amp;T was alluding to
                                        Sports Connection’s withdrawal of the quantum of the
                                        heads of claim provided in the Further and Better
                                        Particulars dated 28 February 2006. In fact, R&amp;T was
                                        told in November 2006 that the Loss of Profits Claim would
                                        be based on Mr Tam’s report which was being
                                        prepared.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In the meantime, promises were
                                        made in November 2006 to give discovery of a substantial
                                        number of documents that were from Malaysia and that the
                                        bulk of the documents would be received in December 2006. As
                                        it turned out, the promises were not kept. As at 23 January
                                        2007, Sports Connection still had not furnished the
                                        documents. Mr Swami complained in an affidavit affirmed on
                                        24 January 2007 that Sports Connection’s repeated
                                        delays had affected S&amp;N’s ability to prepare for
                                        assessment of damages and the delays had resulted in the
                                        parties’ repeated attendances in court to extend

                                        Deloitte asked Sports Connection for documents such

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Deloitte also wanted
                                        Tearproof’s management accounts from the date of its
                                        incorporation, but they were not available. According to
                                        Sports Connection, it was not Tearproof’s practice to
                                        keep such accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>
                                        Sports Connection also only had BM’s financial
                                        statements from 1997 to 2000. Nothing fruitful appeared to
                                        have materialised from Mr Poon’s request to the
                                        “Malaysian CPA” for those documents. I note
                                        Deloitte’s terms of appointment highlighted that
                                        possible limitations to the preparation of the
                                        expert’s report, one of which was that the financial
                                        statements of BM for certain years may not be available. In
                                        fact, Deloitte had even, via its office in Kuala Lumpur,
                                        tried to obtain BM’s financial statements post-2000.
                                        That avenue was also unfruitful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Initial correspondence between
                                        Mr Yee and Deloitte revealed that the original strategy and
                                        methodology was to use Evergreen’s profits as the
                                        basis for the computation of the Loss of Profits
                                                Claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Deloitte worked on
                                        the methodology that required it to use Evergreen’s
                                        profits but it faced many difficulties because of the
                                        incomplete information from Mr Yee. Notably, Mr Yee
                                        expressly acknowledged in contemporaneous communication that
                                        those difficulties were caused by him not being able to
                                        provide information to Deloitte. Mr Yee thought of getting a
                                        court order in Malaysia to compel Evergreen’s auditor
                                        to provide information that Deloitte would need for the
                                        quantification and e-mailed Mr Shahiran to ask how this
                                        information might be obtained in Malaysia,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> but instead Mr Yee
                                        settled on getting Deloitte to come up with an alternative
                                        methodology to compute the Loss of Profits

                                        relation to Evergreen and BM were not at all available. Mr
                                        Yee acknowledged this situation as the “absolute
                                                truth”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>

                                        gathering documentary evidence, Sports Connection was unable

                                        time was already warning Mr Yee that he should
                                        “appreciate that [the] reliability of any numbers
                                        provided by [Sports Connection] may possible be contested by

                                        Deloitte also had to send chasers to the staff of Sports
                                        Connection to provide the documents it required for the Loss
                                        of Profits Claim. Even when the information was provided
                                        pursuant to those chasers, I note that Deloitte had
                                        difficulty reconciling the discrepancies in the data and
                                        even identified certain material discrepancies in relation

                                        the Deloitte Report, it is clear that this methodology

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Meetings between the team from
                                        Deloitte and Mr Yee did not include Mr Shahiran. In January
                                        2007, Mr Shahiran started to remind Mr Yee that Deloitte had
                                        to meet the deadline of 28 February 2007. The deadlines were
                                        also reinforced by a threat from R&amp;T to take out an
                                        “unless order” or orders for costs if the
                                        prevailing timelines were not complied with. At a PTC held
                                        on 9 January 2007, Sports Connection was directed to serve

                                        2007. At that time, Mr Yee was still actively dealing with
                                        Deloitte directly and he promised to get “Deloitte to

                                        Tearproof’s sole supplier.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> One of Sports
                                        Connection’s employees attempted to work around these
                                        discrepancies but not all of them could be
                                                resolved.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> In fact, Deloitte
                                        continued to identify “a huge discrepancy” in
                                        certain aspects of the accounts provided by Sports
                                                Connection.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Mr Yee then mooted
                                        the idea of convening a meeting between Deloitte, Mr
                                        Shahiran and himself on 18 January 2007 so that Mr Shahiran
                                        could review the actual documents that were the subject of
                                        Deloitte’s Report. At this juncture I note that
                                        Deloitte requested Mr Shahiran to obtain access to the books
                                        of BM by writing to the Official Receiver in Malaysia.
                                        Deloitte once again requested Mr Shahiran to obtain the
                                        information on 23 February 2007. It is unclear what
                                        transpired but as no books of BM have come to light, the
                                        approach was probably another dead end.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    On 29 January 2007, a PTC was
                                        held before AR David Lee, who ordered that Sports Connection
                                        was to provide its documents and reply to Further and Better
                                        Particulars no later than 5 February 2007, failing which
                                        Sports Connection’s claim would be dismissed. Mr Yee
                                        realising the importance of the order, instructed Deloitte
                                        to “view this with utmost urgency and fulfil the time
                                        line as required”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Once again, this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    On 2 February 2007, Mr Yee wrote
                                        to Mr Shahiran stating that “[t]he verdict is out!
                                        [Deloitte’s estimate] is at

                                        informed Mr Shahiran that Mr Tam was “confident of
                                        this figure and [was] willing to stand by it in
                                        court”. Answers to Further and Better Particulars
                                        requested were then prepared based on estimate of loss of
                                        profits initially stated at S$2.5m to S$3.5m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The correspondences
                                        revealed without more that Mr Tam had made some last minute
                                        changes to the position in the draft Deloitte
                                                Report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>, which cut down the
                                        estimate of the loss of profits in the particulars to S$2.5m
                                        to S$3m, a departure from Mr Yee’s
                                        “target” of S$4m that he was willing Deloitte
                                        to reach in relation to the claim for loss of profits. The
                                        figures in the final version of the Deloitte Report were
                                        between S$1.7m and S$1.9m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    On 23 February 2007, Mr
                                        Tam’s draft report was sent to ALC. Mr Shahiran
                                        responded. He acknowledged the methodology of extrapolation
                                        used and asked whether the documents used in the report were
                                        included therein. Mr Shahiran also suggested that the
                                        computation of damages should continue into the years 2005
                                        to 2007. Mr Thong, for Deloitte, responded that those years
                                        were not included as Sports Connection was no longer losing
                                        any sales. I set out pertinent portions of Mr Thong’s
                                        reply to shed light on the way Deloitte computed the claim
                                        for loss of profits:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The quantification period determined is a measurement
                                                of the period in which you allegedly loss your sales
                                                as a result of the infridgment [<em>sic</em>] of the trademark. As such, it is
                                                not the point when you are restated as the rightful
                                                owner of the Bodypac trademark but when you have
                                                stopped losing sales as a result of the infridgement
                                                of the trademark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For example, at the present moment in Malaysia, even
                                                though you have not obtained the reinstatement of
                                                the trademark, but you are also not
                                                “losing” sales as anyone who wants to
                                                buy a Bodypac product could only turn to your
                                                company to buy such a product. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, in the same vein, we can only look at the
                                                period whereby there is more than 1 party in the
                                                Malaysia market whereby the consumer could purchase
                                                the Bodypac products as a result of the infridgement
                                                of the trademark. For example, during the period
                                                when [BM] was still a live company, a consumer could
                                                either buy a Bodypac product from your Malaysia
                                                entity or from BM. So if the consumer buys from
                                                [Tearproof] you did not lose a sale but however, if
                                                the consumer chose to buy it from BM, then you lose
                                                a sale. Then, we would compute all these sales that
                                                consumers choose to buy from BM as your loss of
                                                profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Mr Shahiran’s case is that
                                        he sent a letter dated 27 February 2007 to Sports
                                        Connection, warning Sports Connection that the Deloitte
                                        report might not be accepted by the court, due to the lack
                                        of important documents and that accordingly, Sports
                                        Connection should consider if it wished to proceed with the
                                        Loss of Profits Claim, or only with the Legal Costs Claim.
                                        Mr Yee disputes ever receiving this letter.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    After Mr Tam’s AEIC was
                                        filed on 1 March 2007, R&amp;T requested documents that were
                                        used in the Deloitte Report. The documents were delivered by
                                        Sports Connection to R&amp;T on 10 July 2007. R&amp;T
                                        subsequently noted that there were still missing documents.
                                        In October 2007, R&amp;T filed and served the Baker Tilly
                                        Report in reply to the Deloitte Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Following the Baker Tilly
                                        Report, on 18 February 2008, Deloitte asked for further
                                        documents from Mr Yee:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_138-p2_a"></a>(a)     Tearproof’s
                                                ledger for the years 1997 to 2006. This was because
                                                Baker Tilly stated that Tearproof was not a good
                                                proxy for BM.</p>

                                                figure split between Malaysia, Singapore and
                                                Thailand. This was because Baker Tilly alleged that
                                                it appeared highly unlikely that increase in sales
                                                to Malaysia would result in no increase in any

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    It is safe to presume that no
                                        such documents were provided by Mr Yee. A meeting was held
                                        between Mr Shahiran and Mr Yee on 22 February 2008. At this
                                        meeting, they discussed obtaining BM’s financial
                                        accounts through Malaysian solicitors. Later that day, Mr

                                        himself discussed the Deloitte Report and Baker Tilly Report

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Isn’t it true that after
                                                  the Baker Tilly report was released, there were

                                                  and with Shah’s involvement, the upshot of
                                                  which was that Mr Tam took the view that he was

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Mr Shahiran deposed in his AEIC
                                        that one of the issues discussed at that meeting was whether
                                        the Loss of Profits Claim could be assessed through any
                                        other entity other than Sports Connection or Tearproof.
                                        However, Mr Yee and Deloitte concluded that there was no
                                        better proxy other than Tearproof. Mr Shahiran also
                                        testified that it was discussed at that meeting whether
                                        BM’s sale of Bodypac products could be discovered if
                                        they could find out the orders placed by BM with ELF Trading
                                        to manufacture Bodypac products in infringement of the
                                        Trademark. Mr Yee informed Mr Shahiran that he had
                                        previously provided him with one invoice from ELF Trading
                                        which demonstrated Evergreen’s purchase of such
                                        Bodypac products, but Mr Shahiran was not able to locate the
                                        invoice. In March 2008, Mr Yee handed Mr Shahiran a box of
                                        documents pertaining to ELF Trading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Mr Yee subsequently e-mailed Mr
                                        Shahiran to “zero in on [Kaw]’s earlier
                                        testimony, where he said his sales in [RM] 2m per
                                        year” to bolster his damages claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> It should be noted
                                        that documents in this regard had been requested by N&amp;M
                                        as early as June 2005, but none appeared to be forthcoming.
                                        Eventually, the Deloitte Report relied on notes of evidence
                                        of what Mr Kaw said in the Malaysian proceedings, and not on
                                        Mr Kaw’s affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    On 20 March 2008, Mr Shahiran
                                        e-mailed Mr Rajan, requesting his assistance to obtain
                                        copies of documents relating to the winding up of BM in
                                        Malaysia. In or around this time, the hearing of the
                                        Singapore Assessment was fixed for 21 to 25 April 2008. Mr
                                        Rajan replied in early April 2008 with details of BM’s
                                        winding up, although no documents were
                                obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on state of the evidence in relation to the
                                Loss of Profits Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Given the state of the evidence
                                        outlined above, the following are the key features. First,
                                        the chance of obtaining relevant documentary evidence such
                                        as the range of documents from BM and Evergreen (for example
                                        at [124]–[127] above) including those identified by
                                        Deloitte after the Baker Tilly Report was served (<em>ie</em>, further documents requested
                                        pertained to Tearproof and Sports Connection but the
                                        entities did not have them to begin with (at
                                        [138]–[139] above)) was nil or negligible. Second, the
                                        documentary evidence to substantiate the Loss of Profits
                                        Claim was incomplete. Despite the state of the evidence and
                                        the Baker Tilly Report, the expert witness, Mr Tam, was
                                        willing to stand by his report. Third, the documentary
                                        evidence to substantiate the Loss of Profits Claim remained
                                        incomplete despite several extensions of time given to
                                        Sports Connection to give discovery and serve its reply to
                                        R&amp;T’s request for Further and Better Particulars.
                                        In particular, two extension of time had also been granted
                                        to Sports Connections for Mr Tam to prepare his report.
                                        Dates set aside to assess damages in Suit 630 were vacated
                                        at least six times. The first set of trial dates that
                                        included the hearing on liability was scheduled for as early
                                        as August 2005. When Mr Shahiran took over the conduct of
                                        Suit 630, the trial dates were fixed for November 2006.
                                        Trial dates were vacated along the way, and the Singapore
                                        Assessment was only heard in November 2008. Finally, Mr Yee
                                        is an individual who was sure of his own mind. He was
                                        overall a determined litigant convinced that the alternative
                                        action in Suit 630 against his former legal advisers S&amp;N
                                        was more valuable than the Malaysian Assessment would have
                                        been. By 2006, BM was already wound up by a creditor bank. I
                                        am driven to the conclusion that Sports Connection would
                                        have gone ahead willy-nilly with the Singapore Assessment in
                                        November 2008 to attempt to achieve total recovery even
                                        though a decision to continue was indicative of something of
                                        a gamble seeing that the supporting documents were
                                        incomplete and hope was pinned on Mr Tam’s reputation
                                        in his field of expertise to carry the day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Illusory Courses of Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    I have set out the Courses of
                                        Action as pleaded in [92] above. I will now discuss the
                                        Courses of Action in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stay of the Singapore Assessment indefinitely for
                                Malaysian Assessment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    I find the pleaded Course of
                                        Action 1 to stay the Singapore Assessment to be illusory and
                                        fanciful. That assertion presupposes that a stay of the
                                        Singapore Assessment was viable and could be obtained. It
                                        was fanciful and was never a realistic prospect for several
                                        reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The evidence points to Mr
                                        Yee’s decision not to proceed with the Malaysian
                                        Assessment in 2006 (see [47] above). After the KL
                                        Interlocutory Judgment was obtained, Suit 630 was restored
                                        for hearing. Deloitte was appointed and worked on the
                                        quantum of the claim in 2006. As Deloitte needed more time,
                                        Sport Connection applied twice in 2006, September and
                                        November, to extend time to file and serve Mr Tam’s
                                        AEIC. At PTC held on 13 February 2007, Sports Connection was
                                        ordered to file and serve Mr Tam’s AEIC by 28 February
                                        2007. Notably, Sports Connection had until 5 February 2007
                                        to comply with discovery and reply to Further and Better
                                        Particulars failing which its claim would be dismissed.
                                        Quite clearly, no reasonably competent lawyer in the
                                        position of Mr Shahiran would have advised a stay of the
                                        Singapore Assessment. Mr Chacko has not suggested the basis
                                        upon which Mr Shahiran could have gone before the PTC
                                        Registrar to secure a stay of the Singapore
                                        Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    As can be seen from the
                                        narrative in [56]–[64] above, there was no desire to
                                        proceed with the Malaysian Assessment before the conclusion
                                        of the Singapore Assessment. I also note that it was Mr Yee
                                        who decided to “drop” the Malaysian Assessment
                                        back in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It is clear from [47] above
                                        that it was Mr Yee who decided in November 2006 that he did
                                        not need to assess damages in Malaysia, did not require Mr
                                        KSJ’s assistance to come up with a formula to assess
                                        damages in Singapore and Malaysia and that enforcing the
                                        costs order was futile as he was planning to bankrupt Mr Kaw
                                        using the JB Judgment. Consistent with that conduct, is the
                                        acceptance of Mr Shahiran’s advice on which the
                                        decision to use Mr Tam as an expert to compute the Loss of
                                        Profits Claim was made, and Mr Yee’s decision made in
                                        or around June to August 2007 to rely on taxation of party
                                        and party costs instead of assessing damages to obtain a
                                        quantifiable sum for the purpose of bankrupting the
                                        Kaws.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    As an aside, Mr Yee had not paid
                                        his Malaysian lawyers in 2006 and 2007. Separately, he had
                                        arranged for the Malaysian lawyers’ bills to be taxed.
                                        He only contacted Mr KSJ in June 2007 when he wanted to
                                        bankrupt the Kaws using the KL Interlocutory Judgment. As
                                        stated, whilst Mr KSJ asked for express instructions as to
                                        whether he should proceed with the Malaysian Assessment
                                        and/or the taxation of party and party costs in July 2007,
                                        Mr Yee was reminded of MCC’s unpaid bills and that
                                        work would be put on hold until MCC’s bills were
                                        settled. It was confirmed on 2 August 2007 that Mr KSJ was
                                        to tax party and party costs for the purpose of bankrupting
                                        the Kaws (see [45]–[46] and [48] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    I reiterate, Mr Yee’s
                                        instructions to Mr KSJ in July and August 2007 were to get
                                        party and party costs taxed and not to proceed with the
                                        Malaysian Assessment. His decision was tactical as the plan
                                        was to bankrupt the Kaws. Put another way, he wanted to
                                        finish off the Kaws after the KL Interlocutory Judgment, and
                                        it was never his intention to spend more money on assessing
                                        damages in Malaysia which he considered
                                        “futile” (see [47] above). I find that he
                                        considered recovery against S&amp;N as being more valuable
                                        than the Malaysian Assessment against the KL parties. By
                                        then BM was already wound up and he was going to bankrupt
                                        the Kaws. There is no evidence as to what happened in the
                                        period after party and party costs were taxed in October
                                        2008. I am referring to the gap in the evidence as to why
                                        MCC had not followed through with its standing instructions
                                        to bankrupt the Kaws. This evidence seems relevant to the
                                        Legal Costs Claim. There is nothing in the evidence to show
                                        that Sports Connection was ready to mitigate its claim for
                                        loss of a chance to recover legal costs by enforcing the
                                        award for taxed costs on the Kaws.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    I now come to the Baker Tilly
                                        Report which Mr Foong affirmed in October 2007. Yet at this
                                        time, Sports Connection was not ready with its Legal Costs
                                        Claim as Mr Yee wanted the appeal costs in Malaysia to be
                                        claimed in the Singapore Assessment. Sports Connection
                                        applied in November 2007 to have the Legal Costs Claim and
                                        the Loss of Profits Claim bifurcated. Naturally S&amp;N
                                        objected to the application which was dismissed. It was at
                                        this stage that the PTC Registrar suggested the Sports
                                        Connection make use of expert witnesses on costs. By this
                                        stage, the Singapore court was not minded to delay the
                                        Singapore Assessment. By the same token, quite clearly, no
                                        reasonably competent lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran
                                        would have advised a stay of the Singapore Assessment.
                                        Again, Mr Chacko has not suggested the basis upon which Mr
                                        Shahiran could have gone before the PTC Registrar to secure
                                        a stay of the Singapore Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    It can also be seen from details
                                        of the state of the evidence in relation to the Loss of
                                        Profits Claim in Suit 630 above that the state of affairs
                                        over a period of three years was one that was consistently
                                        plagued with delays and trial dates had to be repeatedly
                                        vacated. The state of affairs subsisting at different
                                        periods in time demonstrated that Mr Yee was, and I so find,
                                        fully aware that documents bearing upon Sports
                                        Connection’s claim for loss of profits in Suit 630
                                        were incomplete. It must be emphasised that R&amp;T had
                                        requested for Further and Better Particulars as early as in
                                        October 2005 and Sports Connection’s replies continued
                                        to be unsatisfactory even after the Deloitte Report as far
                                        as R&amp;T was concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    At a PTC held on 11 April 2008,
                                        Senior Assistant Registrar Cornie Ng (“SAR
                                        Ng”) informed counsel in no uncertain terms that her
                                        patience was wearing thin with the constant delays caused by
                                        Sports Connection. She further made clear that delays caused
                                        by Malaysian lawyers in getting documents and passing them
                                        to Sports Connection would not be acceptable excuses any
                                        more. SAR Ng’s warnings were issued at the time when
                                        the April 2008 dates for the Singapore Assessment were
                                        vacated again. Those April dates were given in February or
                                        March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Prior to the PTC in April 2008,
                                        there were two earlier occasions when the court made orders
                                        for Suit 630 to be dismissed or struck out if timelines were
                                        not complied with. On 29 January 2007, Sports Connection was
                                        ordered to give discovery of documents relied on by Deloitte
                                        and in its reply to Further and Better Particulars by 5
                                        February 2007 failing which Sports Connection’s claim
                                        would be dismissed. One year later, on 6 February 2008, the
                                        court imposed a deadline for Sports Connection to file two
                                        AEICs, by 18 February 2008, 4pm, failing which Sports
                                        Connection’s claim would be dismissed with costs. This
                                        new timeline necessitated the dates fixed for March 2008 for
                                        the Singapore Assessment to be vacated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Another point to note as regards
                                        “advice” in the form of Course of Action 1
                                        – a stay of the Singapore Assessment pending disposal
                                        of the Malaysian Assessment which was to proceed first and
                                        for the judgment in the Malaysian Assessment to be used in
                                        evidence as proof of the quantum of Sports
                                        Connection’s Loss of Profits Claim – is that a
                                        stay of the Singapore Assessment for the Malaysian
                                        Assessment did not feature in the case until Sports
                                        Connection lost before AR Teo. As I have alluded to earlier,
                                        the litigation moved to Singapore from Malaysia in 2005 (see
                                        [34] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    In my view, there is no basis
                                        for the argument that Mr Yee lost the chance to take the
                                        pleaded Course of Action 1 because of Mr Shahiran’s
                                        alleged negligence. Course of Action 1 begs the question
                                        whether it was a real and feasible option in the first
                                        place. Reviving the Malaysian Assessment was a chance upon a
                                        chance in that it depended on the courts in Singapore
                                        agreeing to stay the Singapore Assessment
                                        indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    I have already concluded that it
                                        is illusory and fanciful to imagine that Course of Action 1
                                        was even an option. In my view, a reasonably competent
                                        lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran with knowledge of the
                                        long history of the background facts and the proceedings in
                                        Suit 630 would not, on account of those circumstances, have
                                        advised Sports Connection to stay the Singapore Assessment
                                        indefinitely. As stated, the procedural history was one of
                                        prolonged delays, instances of orders to strike out Suit 630
                                        if timelines were not complied with and trial dates vacated
                                        repeatedly. Despite extensions of time, Sports Connection
                                        had not been able to produce over the course of three years
                                        complete documentary evidence needed to support its claim
                                        for loss of profits. There is evidence that in April 2008,
                                        Mr Shahiran warned Mr Yee that the Singapore court had given
                                        Sports Connection more than enough time to prepare for the
                                        Singapore Assessment. This warning was made in the context
                                        of the lack of evidence in respect of certain legal fees
                                        which Mr Yee recently disclosed that he had paid but not
                                        been included in the report prepared by Dato’
                                        Kamalanathan s/o Ratnam (“Dato’
                                        Nanthan”) and which Mr Yee wanted Mr Shahiran to
                                        claim for in the Singapore Assessment. Mr Yee replied that
                                        this was his “honest mistake”, and insisted on
                                        including these claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Mr Shahiran
                                        highlighted the pitfalls of such a course of action in an
                                        e-mail dated 30 April 2008, and requested express
                                        instructions for a supplementary expert report to be filed
                                        and for him to apply to have the supplementary report
                                                admitted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>
                                        Pursuant to further advice, Mr Yee changed his mind on
                                        including these further claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Effect of a foreign judgment on quantum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Sports Connection’s
                                        argument is not about the economic value of a judgment in
                                        the Malaysian Assessment; its focus is on the evidential
                                        value it would have in the Singapore Assessment. In this
                                        regard, Mr Chacko submitted that a judgment in the Malaysian
                                        Assessment would constitute “irrefutable and/or
                                        conclusive evidence of Sports Connection’s losses for
                                        its Loss of Profits Claim”. He relied on ss 13 and 45
                                        of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    From the outset, this contention
                                        that opportunity had been lost of presenting conclusive
                                        evidence in the form of a judgment on damages assessed in
                                        the Malaysian Assessment to support Sports
                                        Connection’s loss of profits in the Singapore
                                        Assessment is legally flawed. As a matter of law, a judgment
                                        in the Malaysian Assessment is not conclusive evidence of
                                        Sports Connection’s loss of profits. In other words,
                                        there is no underlying basis for its proposition that it has
                                        lost a chance to present conclusive evidence via the
                                        Malaysian Assessment to substantiate the Loss of Profits

                                        in the Malaysian Assessment would have no probative value in
                                        Singapore in relation to the fact of whether Sports
                                        Connection suffered any loss. Such loss would still have to
                                        be independently proved in Singapore and a judgment in the
                                        Malaysian Assessment could never be the starting
                                        point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Mr Chacko argued that the
                                        court’s recognition of “certain legal
                                        consequences” flowing from a foreign judgment
                                                (<em>Arul Chandran</em> at
                                        [141]) would include the legal consequence that the KL
                                        parties are liable. This is a misreading of the case. As
                                        explained by Mr Daniel, the phrase “certain legal
                                        consequences” referred to the doctrine of res
                                        judicata and/or estoppel. Both these doctrines are
                                        inapplicable in the current case as S&amp;N were not a party
                                        to the KL Interlocutory Judgment or the Malaysian Assessment

                                        up a related matter which is whether the losses that were

                                        Tearproof. In the current proceedings, the parties do not
                                        dispute that damages were awarded to Sports Connection in
                                        the KL Interlocutory Judgment. The real question is whether
                                        the losses assessed in the Malaysian Assessment in 2012 was
                                        that of Sports Connection or Tearproof. Sports Connection
                                        argued that, in reality, Tearproof’s losses were
                                        essentially Sports Connection’s losses, as Tearproof
                                        was merely a proxy for Sports Connection. Mr KSJ, who was
                                        called as Sports Connection’s witness, said that the
                                        damages awarded in the KL Interlocutory Judgment was only to
                                        Sports Connection with damages suffered by Tearproof and Mr

                                        Connection continued to sell Bodypac products through
                                        Tearproof during the quantification period and that there
                                        was no evidence that such sales were adversely affected by
                                        any competing sales of infringing products. Mr Daniel
                                        pointed out that even Mr Yee was aware and accepted that the
                                        losses claimed in the Malaysian Assessment were
                                        Tearproof’s and not Sports Connection’s (see
                                        [110] above). In light of the contemporaneous documentary
                                        evidence, and the fact that the counterclaim in Suit No
                                        D5-22-1079-1997 in Malaysia was brought by Tearproof alone
                                        and that the Malaysian Judge awarded damages in the
                                        counterclaim to be assessed in favour of Tearproof, Mr
                                        KSJ’s testimony that Tearproof’s loss was a
                                        “subset” of Sport Connection’s claim was
                                        ill-founded. The KL parties did not attend the Malaysian
                                        Assessment in 2012 and Sports Connection could freely argue
                                        that the losses suffered by Tearproof could be ascribed to
                                        Sports Connection. In any event, if the Singapore Assessment
                                        had been stayed in favour of the Malaysian Assessment, and
                                        assuming <em>arguendo</em> that a
                                        judgment similar to the 2012 Judgment was obtained and
                                        presented in Suit 630, it would be open for S&amp;N to
                                        dispute that the damages assessed in the Malaysian
                                        Assessment were in truth Sports Connection’s damages.
                                        In that hypothetical situation, Sports Connection would have
                                        to prove its entitlement to rely on the Malaysian judgment
                                        to show that it had suffered recoverable loss. Even so, this
                                        might not be accepted by the court. Once again, this
                                        demonstrates Sports Connection’s arguments as premised
                                        on a chance upon a chance.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    This “prospect” is
                                        Course of Action 2 which is dependent on the Singapore

                                        Assessment to be revived. Course of Action 2 is crafted in
                                        abstract terms. The absence of details and specificity as to
                                        the type of documents that could be available from the KL
                                        parties is symptomatic of this case.</p>

                                        “lost for words” when Mr Yee was pressed to
                                        explain what alleged additional evidence he could have
                                        obtained in the Malaysian Assessment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The basis of Course

                                        existed and could be ordered to be produced. It seems to me
                                        that in coming up with Course of Action 2, Sports Connection
                                        had not given thought to: (a) the earlier unsuccessful
                                        attempts (outlined in [124]–[127] above) at recovering
                                        documents; and (b) its explanation for its inability to
                                        provide additional documents sought by Deloitte after the
                                        Baker Tilly Report was available. The additional documents
                                        requested related to Tearproof and Sports Connection and if
                                        they existed, Sports Connection ought to have made them
                                        available to Deloitte (at [138]–[139]
                                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Notably, no additional documents
                                        from BM were made available in support of the Malaysian
                                        Assessment in Ferrier Hodgson Report. This is not surprising
                                        seeing that BM was wound up in April 2006 by a creditor bank
                                        and the winding up was before Mr Shahiran took over the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    I also note Mr Yee’s

                                                  underlying matter in Malaysia to say that he was
                                                  selling products to Bodypac Malaysia, and 90 per

                                        evidence as AR Teo in the Singapore Assessment. As stated,
                                        the Malaysian Assessment in 2012 was uncontested in the
                                        absence of the KL parties. By 2012, BM was wound up and Mr
                                        Kaw was adjudicated a bankrupt. This development in 2012
                                        does not translate to Sports Connection obtaining the same
                                        or similar result if the Malaysian Assessment had been

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    The proper advice argument (at
                                        [93] above) focuses on the question whether Mr
                                        Shahiran’s advice (or lack of advice) as pleaded fell
                                        below the standard of the reasonably competent lawyer.
                                        Having reached the conclusion that the Courses of Action
                                        were illusory and fanciful, the Courses of Action were
                                        hardly “advice” that would fall within Mr
                                        Shahiran’s scope of duty for no reasonably competent
                                        lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran would have raised them
                                        as advice to Sports Connection and to advise the latter to
                                        take them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    For completeness, I should
                                        mention Mr Shahiran’s contention that he sent a letter
                                        dated 27 February 2007 to Sports Connection, warning Sports
                                        Connection that the Deloitte Report might not be accepted by
                                        the court, due to the lack of important documents and that
                                        accordingly, Sports Connection should consider if it wished
                                        to proceed with the Loss of Profits Claim, or only with the
                                        Legal Costs Claim. Mr Yee disputes ever receiving this
                                        letter. I agree with Mr Chacko that Mr Shahiran had not
                                        discharged the burden which is on him to prove that the
                                        letter was sent. Be that as it may, this finding does not
                                        affect my conclusion on the scope of the relevant duty based
                                        on the standard of the reasonably competent lawyer in [174]
                                        above (see also [147], [151] and [157] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Like the proper advice argument,
                                        the second issue of primary causation (at [94] above) also
                                        fails. To show the relevant causal link, the legal question
                                        that must be answered by Sports Connection is what action
                                        Sports Connection would on a balance of probability have
                                        taken if it had received proper advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    As to whether it would ever have
                                        been the case that Sports Connection would have proceeded to
                                        assess damages in Malaysia before the Singapore Assessment
                                        if Mr Yee had been advised to go to Malaysia because of the
                                        paucity of evidence supporting the Loss of Profits Claim,
                                        there was significantly no satisfactory evidence at all from
                                        Mr Yee that he would have proceeded in Malaysia before the
                                        Singapore Assessment. Furthermore, the pleaded Courses of
                                        Action were dubious; they were illusory and fanciful. As
                                        such, it has not been proved on the balance of probability
                                        that Mr Yee would have adopted the pleaded Courses of
                                        Actions if such “advice” had been given by the
                                        defendants at any relevant point in time after Mr Shahiran
                                        took over the conduct of the Suit 630 in August 2006 until
                                        before the Singapore Assessment. In the circumstances,
                                        primary causation is not proved, the second stage of the
                                        third principle in <em>Allied
                                                Maples</em> (<em>ie</em>,
                                        whether the chance was a real or substantial one) does not
                                        arise for determination and that is the end of the claim for
                                        loss of a chance as formulated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    I now turn to the loss suffered
                                        by Sports Connection. The main focus of Mr Daniel’s
                                        submissions was that Sports Connection could not establish
                                        any loss. It seems to me and I agree with Mr Daniel that the
                                        outcome of the Singapore Assessment was the result of Sports
                                        Connection’s inability to adduce evidence to
                                        substantiate its loss. I have set out in detail the state of
                                        the evidence that was being gathered over three years and
                                        the documentary evidence remained incomplete until the end.
                                        I find that Sports Connection’s failure at the
                                        Singapore Assessment was, on the balance of probability,
                                        more likely due to the fact that the claim was bad, rather
                                        than negligence of the defendants. As AR Teo found, there
                                        was no proof that Sports Connection’s sales were
                                        adversely affected by any competing sales of infringing
                                        products. The evidence was that Sports Connection continued
                                        to sell Bodypac products through Tearproof during the
                                        quantification period and there was no countervailing
                                        evidence of competing sales by BM for that period. Contrary
                                        to Mr Chacko’s submissions, AR Teo did not rule Mr
                                        Kaw’s statement inadmissible. AR Teo could not have
                                        found Mr Kaw’s statement inadmissible if the ruling
                                        was that it was inadequate after evaluation of the statement
                                        with the rest of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    In part, AR Teo’s decision
                                        depended on whether he accepted Mr Yee’s evidence of
                                        facts and Mr Tam’s expert evidence. It has not been
                                        suggested specifically that Mr Yee should have been advised
                                        that his factual evidence and Mr Tam’s expert opinion
                                        would not be accepted, or that he was not properly advised
                                        of the risk of the court not accepting his and Mr
                                        Tam’s evidence and in the event in some crucial
                                        respects their evidence were rejected. Mr Tam’s
                                        formula to compute loss of profits was accepted by AR Teo
                                        but the numbers needed for computation of the loss based on
                                        the formula were lacking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    No case was pleaded that Mr Yee
                                        in fact thought the claim was hopeless, but Mr Shahiran
                                        failed to advise Mr Yee accordingly. I should also say that
                                        I reject the suggestion advanced to the effect that Mr Yee
                                        was unaware of any shortcomings in the evidence to
                                        substantiate the claim for loss of profits and that he would
                                        never have pursued the Singapore Assessment if advised that
                                        it was subject to any significant risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    As stated, the way Sports
                                        Connection puts its case, the question whether Sports
                                        Connection lost a chance of being better off financially
                                        than it did as a result of litigating in the Singapore
                                        Assessment depends on chances at different stages. To also
                                        say that Sports Connection lost a chance of obtaining
                                        conclusive evidence of loss of profits in the Malaysian
                                        Assessment would not provide itself a claim for damages in
                                        this action. The suggested damage is the loss resulting from
                                        not proceeding with the Malaysian Assessment before the
                                        Singapore Assessment. However, there is no evidence of this
                                        loss since one cannot use the 2012 Judgment because it would
                                        be indulging in hindsight reasoning. Neither has Mr Chacko
                                        specified the type of documents that might have been
                                        obtained from the KL parties in a hypothetical Malaysian
                                        Assessment held at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Once Suit 630 was restored for
                                        hearing, the route embarked upon was to recover damages from
                                        S&amp;N rather than to pursue the KL parties for damages.
                                        This is evident from the history of the background facts,
                                        proceedings and tactics decided upon without the benefit of
                                        hindsight. The focus of the litigation moved from Malaysia
                                        to Singapore. Energy, resources and time were directed and
                                        spent at the litigation in Singapore over a period of three
                                        years. The Malaysian Assessment was decidedly left dormant
                                        to concentrate on Suit 630.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    I have already recounted the
                                        reasons as to why the Malaysian Assessment was left dormant
                                        and it is against that backdrop that Sports
                                        Connection’s allegations in [92] above must be
                                        examined. Equally important was the state of the evidence
                                        that was consistently incomplete over a period of three
                                        years and where delays in Suit 630 were
                                encountered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    In my judgment, Sports
                                        Connection could not show that it had a real or substantial
                                        chance of obtaining further evidence in Malaysia from the KL
                                        parties, <em>a fortori</em>, it was not
                                        able to show that it would have obtained such evidence on
                                        the balance of probability even if the defendants had not
                                        committed the breaches complained of. I must also add that
                                        Sports Connection’s argument on the evidentiary value
                                        of a Malaysian <em>in personam</em>
                                        judgment for use in the Singapore Assessment is a complete
                                        non-starter for reasons discussed above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    For these reasons, the Loss of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    Mr Chacko clarified in his Reply
                                        Submissions that the nub of Sports Connection’s
                                        complaint was about Mr Shahiran’s failure to advise
                                        Sports Connection on the duty to mitigate by: (a) taxing
                                        party and party costs of the KL Interlocutory Judgment; and
                                        (b) enforcing the taxed party and party costs against the
                                        Kaws. As a result of Mr Shahiran’s omission, Sports
                                        Connection lost a real or substantial chance to recover full
                                        solicitor and client costs that Sports Connection had
                                        incurred in the KL Suits (<em>ie</em>,
                                        the remaining 70% of the solicitor and client costs
                                        disallowed by AR Teo).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    I narrated the developments that
                                        led to instructions to MCC to proceed to tax party and party
                                        costs for use in the Singapore Assessment in [40]–[54]
                                        above. Indeed, Sports Connection accepted that Mr Shahiran
                                        had advised it on the taxation of party and party costs in a
                                        telephone conference call on 2 August 2007. Mr KSJ in
                                        cross-examination conceded that Mr Shahrian had asked him to
                                        proceed with the taxation of party and party
                                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    However, Sports Connection took
                                        a fine point which was that Mr Shahiran requested it to
                                        proceed with the taxation of party and party costs to get a
                                        quantified sum as a precursor to bankrupting Mr Kaw and Ms
                                        Heng and not because he appreciated that Sports Connection
                                        needed to mitigate its losses in relation to the Legal Costs
                                        Claim. In addition, Sports Connection argued that Mr
                                        Shahiran had breached his duty by not following up with the
                                        status of the party and party costs for more than one year.
                                        Eventually, the party and party costs were taxed in Malaysia
                                        before the hearing of the Singapore Assessment, but Mr
                                        Shahiran had refused to accept the papers relating to the
                                        taxed costs from Mr Yee as the former took the view that the
                                        taxed costs were no longer relevant for the Singapore
                                        Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    I make a few points. First, I do
                                        not follow the logic of the distinction made by Sports
                                        Connection between taxing party and party costs as a
                                        precursor to bankrupting the Kaws and mitigation. Various
                                        correspondences between the parties revealed that Mr Yee
                                        knew that the bankruptcy of the Kaws would be relevant to
                                        the Singapore Assessment. In an e-mail dated 25 June 2007,
                                        Mr Yee instructed Mr KSJ to execute bankruptcy proceedings
                                        against BM, Mr Kaw and Ms Heng. Importantly, he stated
                                        “[d]o note, I need to show this bankrupt proceedings
                                        to the [Registrar]/Court of Singapore”. Again, on 21
                                        May 2008, Mr Yee e-mailed Mr KSJ stating:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    The fact that Mr Shahiran
                                        recognised the need to bankrupt both Mr Kaw and Ms Heng
                                        showed that Mr Shahiran appreciated the need for Sports
                                        Connection to establish, in the Singapore Assessment, that
                                        it was not able to recover its legal costs incurred in the
                                        KL Suits from the Kaws. Notably, AR Teo stated that Sports
                                        Connection was “precluded from recovering the 70% of
                                        costs which it could have recovered had it proceeded to
                                        enforce its entitlement to costs in Malaysia”,
                                        revealing that the basis of awarding only 30% of the legal
                                        costs claimed to Sports Connection was because Sports
                                        Connection should have claimed the remaining 70% from the
                                        Kaws. Hence, if Sports Connection had shown that the Kaws
                                        were bankrupt or impecunious, Sports Connection might have
                                        succeeded in recovering the Legal Costs Claim in full. There
                                        is nothing to the complaint that Mr Shahiran had not advised
                                        Sports Connection to mitigate its losses in relation to the
                                        Legal Costs Claim.</p>

                                        were taxed and the amount of the taxed costs was known on 15

                                        sum of RM 152,688 together with interest thereon at the rate
                                        of 8% per annum from the date of the KL Interlocutory
                                        Judgment until the date of payment was not produced at the
                                        Singapore Assessment in November 2008 and that led to AR
                                        Teo’s findings as set out at [33(b)] above. Mr Yee
                                        said that the reason why information and the papers on the
                                        taxed costs were not produced at the Singapore Assessment
                                        was that Mr Shahiran did not want them. Mr Shahiran
                                        disagreed with Mr Yee. Mr Shahiran contended that he was not
                                        told the results of the taxation. In response, Mr Daniel
                                        submitted that it was Mr Yee who withheld information on the
                                        taxed party and party costs and papers from Mr
                                        Shahiran.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    I accept Mr Daniel’s
                                        submissions in light of some objective evidence in support
                                        of his position:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_192-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr Yee’s AEIC
                                                said nothing about Mr Shahiran’s refusal to
                                                accept the papers on taxed party and party costs
                                                from Mr Yee.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_192-p2_b"></a>(b)     The amount of the taxed party and
                                                party costs was disappointingly low and it was not
                                                in Sports Connection’s interest to reveal the
                                                amount that was taxed in the Singapore Assessment.
                                                In fact, Mr KSJ recommended a review as the amount
                                                of taxed costs was “too low and
                                                insufficient” (see [52] above). Mr Yee did
                                                not reply to this letter. Logically, presenting the
                                                papers in the Singapore Assessment might risk
                                                reducing the Legal Costs Claim seeing that Sports
                                                Connection was awarded RM 152,688.50 as taxed costs.
                                                Even when this amount is scaled-up to solicitor and
                                                client costs, that amount would be lower than that
                                                estimated by the experts on costs. S&amp;N’s
                                                expert, Mr Anantham Kasinather (“Mr
                                                Kasi”) in his report gave the figure RM
                                                418,375.50. Dato’ Nathan’s Report gave
                                                the figure of RM 1 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_192-p2_c"></a>(c)     As pointed out by
                                                Mr Daniel, Mr Shahiran complied and filed Sports
                                                Connection’s 2nd Supplementary List of
                                                Documents, consisting largely of documents filed by
                                                Ms Subitra in respect of the solicitor and client
                                                taxation in Malaysia on 17 October 2008 in Suit 630.
                                                I agree with Mr Daniel that in keeping with Sports
                                                Connection’s continual disclosure obligations,
                                                the papers on the party and party taxation would in
                                                the normal course of events have been included in
                                                the 2nd supplementary list of documents in Suit 630
                                                if they were handed over to Mr
                                        Shahiran.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_192-p2_d"></a>(d)     Mr Yee did not reveal that party and
                                                party costs had been taxed when he testified before
                                                AR Teo. Mr Yee’s evidence in the Singapore
                                                Assessment was to the effect that he could still be
                                                “in the process” of working out the
                                                costs that BM was supposed to pay in respect of the
                                                Malaysia Assessment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> In
                                                relation to this point, Mr Yee had misled the court
                                                in the Singapore Assessment while he was on oath by
                                                being economical with the
                                truth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    The inference that I draw from
                                        the totality of the circumstances is that Mr Yee had
                                        withheld the papers in relation to the taxed party and party
                                        costs from Mr Shahiran. No question of a loss of a chance
                                        arises since it was the conduct of Sports Connection and not
                                        that of a third party that was involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In conclusion, Sports Connection
                                        has no basis to complain that Mr Shahiran was liable in
                                        negligence for not advising that it should have taxed party
                                        and party costs in Malaysia for use in the Singapore
                                        Assessment when Sports Connection had in fact done so and
                                        obtained taxed costs in those proceedings, which it later
                                        failed to produce before AR Teo in the Singapore
                                        Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dato’ Nathan’s Report and Mr Kasi’s
                                Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    By way of background, it
                                        appeared that when Mr Shahiran took over the conduct of Suit
                                        630 from N&amp;M, the claim for legal costs against S&amp;N
                                        was limited to the costs incurred in the KL Suits and
                                        obtaining the KL Interlocutory Judgment on liability.
                                        Subsequently, around June 2007, Mr Shahiran came to
                                        understand that there were still matters on-going in
                                        Malaysia, namely, the appeal to the Malaysian Court of
                                        Appeal, and that Sports Connection was intending to seek to
                                        recover the appeal expenses under its Legal Costs Claim in
                                        Singapore. Mr Shahiran therefore suggested that the
                                        Singapore Assessment be bifurcated so that the Loss of
                                        Profits Claim could proceed first leaving the costs of the
                                        appeal to be quantified later since it was on-going in
                                        Malaysia at the material time. Mr Yee agreed to that
                                        suggestion and an application for bifurcation of the claims
                                        was taken out. The Assistant Registrar heard the application
                                        but dismissed it. However, he suggested that the parties
                                        could tender expert evidence from Malaysia to support their
                                        respective positions in relation to the Legal Costs
                                        Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    Pursuant to this suggestion,
                                        Sports Connection engaged Dato’ Nathan, a retired
                                        Judge of the High Court of Malaysia, to prepare an expert
                                        report to support the Legal Costs Claim. Dato’
                                        Nathan’s Report was exhibited in his AEIC dated 16
                                        February 2008. Dato’ Nathan’s Report considered
                                        the following matters involving Sports Connection in
                                        assessing the solicitor and client costs that were or would
                                        be incurred by Sports Connection:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_196-p2_a"></a>(a)     the KL
                                                Suits;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_196-p2_b"></a>(b)     the appeal to the Malaysian Court of
                                                Appeal;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_196-p2_c"></a>(c)     the taxation of MCC’s
                                                invoices; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_196-p2_d"></a>(d)     the JB Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Having considered the above, Dato’
                                                Nathan estimated that the taxed costs exclusive of
                                                disbursements would amount to RM 1
                                        million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    S&amp;N engaged a Malaysian
                                        lawyer, Mr Kasi, as their expert in respect of the Legal
                                        Costs Claim. Mr Kasi was a senior practitioner. In Mr
                                        Kasi’s Report, Mr Kasi opined that the solicitor and
                                        client costs incurred by Sports Connection to its solicitors
                                        in Malaysia in relation to the Legal Costs claim would be RM
                                        418,375.50.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    After assessing these expert
                                        reports, AR Teo opined that in relation to the Legal Costs
                                        Claim, Mr Kasi’s Report should be preferred and the
                                        legal costs incurred by Sports Connection in the KL Suits
                                        were RM 418,375.50. AR Teo held that Sports Connection was
                                        only entitled to 30% of that amount as 70% of such costs
                                        ought to have been claimed by Sports Connection as party and
                                        party costs against the Kaws and not against S&amp;N. In
                                        this regard, AR Teo noted that Sports Connection did not
                                        adduce evidence to show that it had proceeded with the party
                                        and party taxation and taken the necessary steps to enforce
                                        the taxed costs against the Kaws.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    Sports Connection alleged that
                                        Mr Shahiran had failed to advise Sports Connection on the
                                        issues in Dato’ Nathan’s Report and Mr
                                        Kasi’s Report. The complaint is that Mr Shahiran
                                        should have pointed out to it that Dato’
                                        Nathan’s estimate was at odds with the amount invoiced
                                        by MCC at that time which amounted to RM 680,000.
                                        Essentially, Sports Connection argued that Mr Shahiran
                                        should have pointed out that Dato’ Nathan had no
                                        explanation as to why a Malaysian court would order taxed
                                        costs above and beyond the amounts stated on the
                                        solicitor’s invoices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Sports Connection also argued
                                        that Mr Shahiran should have pointed out that Dato’
                                        Nathan had erroneously included the JB Suit in the
                                        assessment of the taxed costs. The JB Suit was entirely
                                        separate from the KL Suits and did not arise out of or
                                        relate to the infringement of the Trademark and could not be
                                        attributed to the S&amp;N’s negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    The points mentioned here were
                                        raised in Mr Kasi’s Report which was exhibited in his
                                        AEIC filed on 17 March 2008, a month after Dato’

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Having considered the background
                                        facts and the complaints against Mr Shahiran in respect of
                                        the differing views of the experts on costs in Malaysia, I
                                        do not see how these complaints against Mr Shahiran are
                                        relevant to the Legal Costs Claim and it is not surprising
                                        that Mr Chacko confined his Reply Submissions to the duty to
                                        mitigate issue (at [186] above). I say no more about this
                                        aspect of the complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Advice to tax solicitor and client costs incurred in the
                                KL Suits for the Legal Costs Claim </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    In this action, Sports
                                        Connection seeks to recover as wasted costs the professional
                                        fees of the Malaysian lawyer, one Ms Subitra, who assisted
                                        Sports Connection to tax the professional fees of MCC. This
                                        complaint is based on Mr Shahiran’s erroneous advice
                                        to tax solicitor and client costs for the purposes of the
                                        Legal Costs Claim in the Singapore Assessment despite being
                                        informed by Mr KSJ that taxation was out of
                                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    At the outset, there is no
                                        satisfactory evidence that Mr Shahiran had expressly given
                                        advice that it was solicitor and client taxation, and not
                                        taxation of party and party costs that was relevant for the
                                        purposes of the Singapore Assessment. I am mindful that
                                        Sports Connection was already unhappy with his Malaysian
                                        lawyers’ bills way back in 2003. Mr Yee felt that the
                                        bills were too high and wanted to tax the bills of Sng &amp;
                                        Co and MCC. I refer to a letter sent by N&amp;M to Sports
                                        Connection on 25 February 2003, which reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Terry there are really two issues here. The first is

                                                “not claimable”, and that party and
                                                party costs were relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    In June 2005, Mr Yee contacted
                                        Ms Subitra to inquire if there was a time limitation to tax
                                        the Malaysian lawyers’ bills. By September 2005, Mr
                                        Yee had instructed Ms Subitra to tax the Malaysian
                                        lawyers’ bills. In April 2006, Ms Subitra informed Mr
                                        Yee that she had prepared the relevant papers to tax Sng
                                        &amp; Co’s bill and was intending to have them filed
                                        the first week of May 2006. Mr Yee then asked Ms Subitra
                                        about how to go about taxing MCC’s bill. Ms Subitra
                                        replied that she needed to look at the file to estimate the
                                        costs based on work that was actually done. Some documents
                                        were sent to Ms Subitra in early 2006. Ms Subitra was also
                                        queried about the feasibility of taxing both Sng &amp; Co
                                        and MCC together, as Mr Yee felt that both firms duplicated
                                        certain items of work but was concerned that he would be
                                        able to tax both firms fees at the same time. Ms Subitra
                                        stated that while she might not be able to tax both bills at
                                        the same time, she could ask the court for a consolidated
                                        hearing. Mr Yee agreed “since Ken St. James
                                        [MCC’s] bill is also not low”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    This intention to tax the
                                        lawyers’ bills continued into the time Mr Shahiran
                                        took over the conduct of Suit 630 in August 2006 and beyond.
                                        It seems to me that Mr Yee conveniently used for his own
                                        purpose the Singapore Assessment as an excuse to press on
                                        with the taxation of his Malaysian lawyers’ bills and
                                        sought to claim the legal costs for that from S&amp;N.
                                        Indeed, Mr KSJ doubted Mr Yee’s explanation and
                                        queried the relevance of taxing his bill for the Singapore
                                        Assessment. In an e-mail dated 22 June 2007, Mr KSJ stated
                                        that the solicitor and client bills which he raised
                                        “would not be directly relevant to the amount of
                                        costs that Kaw was ordered to pay you”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> Again, on 9 July
                                        2007, Mr KSJ reiterated his position that he found it
                                        “unusual that the Singapore Court wants your taxed
                                        Solicitor-Client costs as opposed to your taxed

                                        The application to tax the Malaysian lawyers’ bills
                                        was eventually dismissed on 18 March 2008 as it was filed
                                        out of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    Sports Connection’s true
                                        intention in taxing the Malaysian lawyers’ bills was
                                        because Mr Yee was unhappy with the bills incurred in the KL
                                        Suits. In the papers filed in the taxation of the
                                        lawyers’ bills, he deposed that the bills were
                                        “excessive and unreasonable and/or not equivalent to
                                        the legal services which have been provided”. He also
                                        deposed that the charges of the two law firms were
                                        “excessive and/or exorbitant” and that there
                                        seemed to be an “overlap of charges” for the
                                        “same amount of work done”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>

                                        neither here nor there. According to Mr Shahiran, he never
                                        advised Sports Connection to tax the Malaysian
                                        lawyers’ bills and it was something that Sports
                                        Connection wanted.</p>

                                        regard, Mr Yee sent an e-mail to Mr Shahiran on 16 November

                                        which pertained to the Legal Costs Claim, Mr Shahiran was to
                                        note that Sports Connection was taxing the “2 firms

                                        taxation of the Malaysian lawyers’ bills. Over the
                                        course of Mr Shahiran’s retainer, Mr Yee sent and
                                        forwarded Mr Shahiran many e-mails pertaining to his
                                        taxation of the Malaysian lawyers’ bills. Finally, on

                                        that he asked Sports Connection for updates on the taxation
                                        of the Malaysian lawyers’ bills as he was required to
                                        disclose them as part of Sports Connection’s discovery
                                        obligation in Suit 630.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    For the reasons stated, the
                                        claim for wasted costs as described in [70(c)] above
                                        fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The March OTS</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary points</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    In March 2008, S&amp;N offered
                                        to pay the sum of S$200,000 in full and final settlement of
                                        Suit 630 (<em>ie</em>, the March OTS).
                                        Sports Connection’s argument is that it had lost a
                                        real or substantial chance to accept the March OTS which
                                        would have given it more than what was recovered in the
                                        Singapore Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    As I have alluded earlier,
                                        Sports Connection’s alternative claim for the loss of
                                        chance to accept the March OTS is <em>not</em> a case for loss of a chance. Sports
                                        Connection’s loss did not depend on the hypothetical
                                        actions of a third party, but instead depended on the
                                        hypothetical actions of Sports Connection itself if the
                                        alleged breach had not occurred. In short, the facts
                                        pertaining to the March OTS fell within the second principle
                                        in <em>Allied Maples</em> (see [75]
                                        above). As such, the inquiry concerns the primary causation
                                        issue, <em>viz</em>, whether Sports
                                        Connection would have accepted the March OTS if it had
                                        received the advice it claims SSLC omitted to give. This is
                                        a matter which Sports Connection must prove on a balance of
                                        probability.</p>

                                        this period to October 2008, Mr Shahiran and Mr Yee appeared
                                        focussed on shoring up the evidence to support the claims
                                        for legal costs, as Mr Yee stated that he “want[s] to

                                        On 17 October 2008, Sports Connection filed its 2nd
                                        supplementary list of documents and accompanying affidavit
                                        which concerned documents relating to the Legal Costs

                                        informed Mr Yee that the taxed costs were too low and

                                        there was no review.</p>

                                        Assessment was from 3 to 5 November 2008. AR Teo reserved

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What action would Sports Connection on a balance of

                                primary causation issue)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    This March OTS was made while
                                        the trial dates were fixed for 21 to 25 April 2008. It
                                        appears that Mr Shahiran forwarded the March OTS to Sports
                                        Connection on 30 April 2008 at the time he wrote to Mr Yee
                                        to confirm Mr Yee’s decision and instructions not to
                                        accept the March OTS. With that decision not to accept the
                                        March OTS, the parties pressed on with litigation. The trial
                                        dates in the horizon were July 2008. However, the July dates
                                        were also vacated. Eventually, in July 2008, the Singapore
                                        Assessment was finally fixed for November
                                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    It seems to me that having come
                                        so far in the litigation, there was no incentive to settle
                                        at a fraction of the claim amount in the Deloitte Report.
                                        The next opportunity to advise on the March OTS was after
                                        the November 2008 hearing of the Singapore Assessment. I am
                                        mindful that, on 11 November 2008, Mr Shahiran wrote to Mr
                                        Yee shortly after the hearing of the Singapore Assessment to
                                        set out his views on how Sports Connection fared in the
                                        assessment. He expressed his concerns that the assessment
                                        hearing did not go well. He highlighted the testimonies of
                                        Mr Tam and Mr Yee as areas of major concern. Mr Yee did not
                                        see Mr Shahiran’s letter as his advice to accept the
                                        March OTS. In cross-examination, Mr Yee said that it was
                                        because Mr Shahiran did not say that “There’s
                                        no other way”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    In my view, the message in the
                                        letter of 11 November 2008 was clear enough and Mr
                                        Yee’s attempt to place a gloss over it is baseless and
                                        without merit. The 11 November 2008 letter discussed the
                                        following: First, it commented that “the opposing
                                        solicitor … has through his cross examination, badly
                                        effected [<em>sic</em>] your
                                        case”. It then discussed the problems in the Deloitte
                                        Report arising from the lack of evidence and documents.
                                        After repeating the costs implications of not accepting the
                                        March OTS, the letter sought Sports Connection’s
                                        confirmation that it wished to reject the
                                offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    The court in reviewing the
                                        advice rendered in relation to an offer to settle would not
                                        expect that the solicitor renders comprehensive advice that
                                        is of great precision. In my opinion, it is sufficient that
                                        the advice discusses the merits of the case and highlights
                                        that the March OTS would still be available for acceptance.
                                        The 11 November letter touched on the merits of the case as
                                        evinced from Mr Shahiran’s discussion of the evidence
                                        adduced in the Singapore Assessment. It is implicit in the
                                        11 November letter that Mr Shahiran was asking Sports
                                        Connection to consider the March OTS once again. I am of the
                                        view that Mr Shahiran has, in the 11 November letter,
                                        sufficiently advised Sports Connection in relation to the
                                        March OTS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    As to whether it would ever have
                                        been the case that Sports Connection would have accepted the
                                        March OTS if Mr Yee had been given advice stating that there
                                        was “no other way” as Mr Yee said Mr Shahiran
                                        should have told him about, two things stand out: (a) there
                                        was no specific plea of that point in the Statement of
                                        Claim, and (b) there was significantly no clear evidence to
                                        show on the balance of probability that Mr Yee would have
                                        accepted the March OTS but for Mr Shahiran’s alleged
                                        breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    A related argument is that
                                        Sports Connection would have accepted the March OTS if Mr
                                        Shahiran had advised it to take it as early as April 2008.
                                        Sports Connection’s complaint is that Mr Shahiran had
                                        not advised that it should accept the March OTS as it was
                                        likely that Sports Connection would obtain less than the
                                        March OTS sum in the Singapore Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    As can be seen from the
                                        narrative of the state of affairs after the March OTS was
                                        filed on 31 March 2008 (at [214]–[222] above), the
                                        hearing of the Singapore Assessment was fixed for 21 to 25
                                        April 2008. At that time, Mr Yee was still seeking to
                                        include other types of costs under the Legal Costs Claim. It
                                        was not surprising to see Mr Shahiran confirming Mr
                                        Yee’s rejection of the March OTS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    Besides, Sports
                                        Connection’s submission in [228] is hard to believe
                                        for a variety of reasons. The loss that was being alleged is
                                        the difference between the March OTS sum and the sum of RM
                                        160,512.65 (approximately S$66,716.26) which was what was
                                        eventually recovered in the Singapore Assessment. Given the
                                        costs expended in the Malaysian proceedings at that time and
                                        the size of Sports Connection’s claim (with the Loss
                                        of Profits Claim valued between S$1.7m–S$1.9 m and the
                                        Legal Costs Claim valued at about RM 1 million), it is
                                        unlikely on the balance of probability that Sports
                                        Connection would have accepted the March OTS however
                                        well-advised it was.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    As noted in my analysis of the
                                        Loss of Profits Claim, Mr Yee was confident in Mr
                                        Tam’s ability to stand by the Deloitte Report despite
                                        the Baker Tilly Report. Also, as noted in my analysis of the
                                        Legal Costs Claim, Mr Yee was equally content to go along
                                        with Dato’ Nathan’s Report which opined a figure
                                        much higher than the party and party costs that was taxed in
                                        October 2008. In this regard, it is also significant that in
                                        Suit 630, the expert witness for S&amp;N, Mr Kasi, had
                                        opined that Sports Connection should be entitled to at least
                                        RM 292,862.85 (approximately S$125,000). Mr Kasi also
                                        estimated the Legal Costs Claim at about RM 418,375.50
                                        (approximately S$173,000). These would have been relevant
                                        facts for Sports Connection to take on board.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the March OTS</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    In sum, I find that Mr Shahiran
                                        had sufficiently advised Sports Connection on the March OTS.
                                        Even assuming for the sake of argument that the advice
                                        rendered to Sports Connection was inadequate, I would not
                                        hold Mr Shahiran liable for negligence because I am of the
                                        view that Sports Connection has not proved on a balance of
                                        probability that it would have accepted the March OTS in the
                                        circumstances subsisting at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Wasted Costs </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    Sports Connection has an
                                        alternative claim for wasted costs in [70(e)] above being
                                        the legal fees paid to the defendants in the sum of
                                        S$305,345.20. The argument is that it wasted legal fees in
                                        respect of the Loss of Profits Claim, as Sports Connection
                                        was not awarded any damages for this head of claim in the
                                        Singapore Assessment, even though it incurred significant
                                        legal costs in that respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    As noted, Sports Connection also
                                        argued that should Mr Shahiran be held to have erroneously
                                        advised it to embark on solicitor and client taxation, it
                                        would have incurred wasted costs in relation to the legal
                                        costs paid to Ms Subitra on the taxation of the Malaysian
                                        lawyers’ bills and the costs of RM 30,000 it was
                                        ordered to pay after its taxation petition was dismissed.
                                        This is the wasted costs as described in [70(c)] above and
                                        has been dealt with at [203]–[211]
                                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    There is no merit to this claim
                                        for wasted costs of litigation as I have already concluded
                                        that Mr Yee would have in any case proceeded with the
                                        Singapore Assessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    As an aside, I should mention
                                        the history of Mr Yee’s unhappiness with the
                                        defendants’ bills. The genesis of it had nothing to do
                                        with Mr Shahiran’s negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    Shortly after the files in
                                        relation to Suit 630 were transferred to Legis Point LLC in
                                        June 2009, Sports Connection in July 2009 asked for the
                                        bills of ALC and SSLC to be taxed. The hearing took place in
                                        March 2010 and the High Court’s decision is reported
                                        as <em>Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Law
                                                Corp and another</em> [2010] 4 SLR 590

                                                (Taxation)</em>”). It will be seen in
                                                <em>Sports Connection
                                                (Taxation)</em> at [44] that the Judge took
                                        the view that there was no evidence of overcharging on the
                                        part of the defendants. The Judge also made the following
                                        observations on Sports Connection’s motives behind
                                        bringing the application:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    … Evidently there was
                                                  sufficient information to enable [Sports
                                                  Connection] to make an informed decision to pay
                                                  the bulk of the invoices raised by the
                                                  [defendants]. In fact from the evidence before me,
                                                  in particular the conduct of [Sports Connection],
                                                  it was clear that it did not believe that there
                                                  was overcharging by the [defendants] as and when
                                                  each of the successive invoices was raised. It was
                                                  not without significance that the dispute over the
                                                  fees only emerged after the outcome of the
                                                  assessment. Obviously [Sports Connection] was not
                                                  entirely pleased with the end result but this, in
                                                  my view, does not amount to special
                                                  circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    It did not escape my attention
                                                  that [Sports Connection] similarly applied to tax
                                                  the costs of its Malaysian solicitors in respect
                                                  of work done for the litigation against the
                                                  parties who had infringed [Sports
                                                  Connection’s] trademark in Malaysia long
                                                  after the bills were paid or, in any event,
                                                  outside the prescribed period (in Malaysia, the
                                                  period is six months). It was no coincidence that
                                                  alleged overcharging by the solicitors was the
                                                  principal ground relied on by [Sports Connection]
                                                  for leave to tax the bills. The application was
                                                  dismissed by the Malaysian court in March 2008
                                                  more than 18 months prior to the filing of the
                                                  present OS. Although this dismissal is strictly
                                                  irrelevant as to whether there was overcharging by
                                                  the [Defendants] for their conduct of the Suit, it
                                                  served to highlight the fact that [Sports
                                                  Connection] was, on all accounts, <em>a sophisticated litigant who is
                                                  adequately familiar with solicitors’ costs
                                                  and access to taxation</em>. <em>The fact that five sets of solicitors

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    Sports Connection appealed

                                        by the Law Society in November 2011. I note in passing that
                                        there was no allegation by Mr Yee that Mr Shahiran was
                                        negligent in the conduct of Suit 630 in the Law Society

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    On 1 September 2011 –
                                        about two years after Mr Shahiran ceased to have conduct of
                                        Suit 630 – Sports Connection commenced the current
                                        action against N&amp;M, ALC and SSLC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    For the reasons stated in this
                                        Judgment, Sports Connection’s action against ALC and
                                        SSLC is dismissed in its entirety with costs to be taxed if
