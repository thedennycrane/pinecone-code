They therefore sought specific performance of the sale and purchase of the Property as they have to deliver vacant possession of their HDB flat (which they had sold) by about 14 September 2022. The defendant’s actions left them in a lurch as they would have no place to stay after 14 September 2022. Moreover, if there was a delay in obtaining an order for specific performance, they would have to incur further costs in obtaining alternative accommodation. As such, time was of the essence. The claimants further attested that they were ready, willing and able to exercise the Option and complete the purchase of the Property.

As such, the defendant claimed that Lee had not done his due diligence and had misled the defendant in respect of the price of the Property. Hence on 31 March 2022, the defendant decided to call off the sale, and that was also the reason why he did not instruct Subra Law to act in the sale of the Property.

The defendant also claimed that when he signed the Option whilst still in Myanmar, he was under tremendous pressure from his work and from the living conditions there.

Hence it cannot be said that the Option was void for uncertainty. Nevertheless, I will deal with the defendant’s assertions as to how he came to sign the Option and receive the Option Money, which I find in any event did not cause the Option to be invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 First, the defendant claimed that he signed the Option because his agent, Lee, kept pestering him to sell the Property and he wanted to get Lee off his back (see [13] above). He claimed that when he returned the signed copy of the Option to Lee (via WhatsApp) on 18 March 2022, he informed Lee that he could not sell the Property at the stated price in the Option as he felt it was grossly unfair to him. However, the defendant’s claims were not supported by the evidence. The WhatsApp messages (which the defendant exhibited) between him and Lee did not show that he informed Lee that he did not wish to sell the Property for $1.058m (the stated price in the Option). His claims also flew in the face of his conduct of signing the Option, getting a witness for the Option and then returning the Option to Lee, knowing it would be forwarded to the claimants for them to act on. If the defendant did not wish to sell the Property at the stated price, he could have just refused to sign the Option. In this regard, it is material that the defendant did not sign the Option once, but twice – the second time after he was informed by Lee that the first signed Option was unclear (see [13] above). There was no reason why he would re-sign the Option and forward a copy of it to Lee if he had already told Lee that he did not want to sell the Property at the stated price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Further, contrary to the defendant’s claim that he was sent the Option on 16 March 2022, the WhatsApp chats showed Lee had already sent the defendant a copy of the Option around 11 March 2022.

Recital A of the Option which the defendant signed (and would have read) provided for the Option Money to be paid by “paynow transfer”. There was also no documentary evidence (such as WhatsApp messages) to show the defendant had informed Lee that he wanted to be paid by cheque and that he would not accept PayNow as a mode of payment of the Option Money. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On the contrary, the WhatsApp messages showed that on 19 March 2022, Lee informed the defendant that the claimants wanted to pay him the Option Money by PayNow. Lee also asked the defendant to link his PayNow to his NRIC details by updating his profile on the internet-banking facility, to enable payment to be effected by PayNow. The defendant did not object but instead replied to tell Lee to “give [him] a while” as he was unable to verify Lee’s request.

</div>, then it was for the defendant to pursue Lee on this matter. As for his son’s condition, this was not something that invalidated the Option. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Finally, I add that the claimants have attempted to exercise the Option on 6 April 2022 by delivering a signed copy and the Remaining Sum to Subra Law, together with a cover letter. There was no dispute that the claimants were within the timeline for exercising the Option. That Subra Law refused to accept the exercise of the Option (and Remaining Sum) was due to the defendant’s default in failing to see through the matter, given his refusal to instruct Subra Law to act on his behalf. In this regard, two decisions by the Court of Appeal are instructive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Tai Joon Lan</span> (at [15]), the Court of Appeal found that if the appellant had performed her obligation of nominating a firm of solicitors  to accept the notice of exercise of the option and to receive the 10% purchase price (less what had been paid as option money), the respondents would have duly exercised the option and there would have arisen a contract for the sale and purchase of the property between them. It was the appellant who had repudiated the option and prevented the respondents from exercising it and purchasing the property. The Court thus treated the delivery of the notice of exercise of the option and the down-payment (as stipulated in the option) as valid and compelled the appellant to perform the contract. As such, the Court upheld the trial judge’s decision granting specific performance, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the appellant should sell and transfer the property to the respondents. In <span class="font-italic">Tai Joon Lan</span>, the deposit was to be paid to the vendor’s solicitors which had not yet been named in the option. The Court of Appeal nevertheless held that this did not invalidate the option as the vendor had earlier informed the purchasers that she would name the solicitors but subsequently refused to do so. As in <span class="font-italic">Tai Joon Lan</span> (at [13]), the claimants here were prevented from duly exercising the option by the defendant’s omission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">Seng Swee </span><span class="font-italic">Leng v Wong Chong Weng</span> [2011] SGCA 64, the appellant had exercised the option validly by delivering the option with the duly executed acceptance copy and the sum of 5% of the purchase price (less the option fee) to the vendor’s (respondent’s) solicitors, DSPP Law Corporation (“DSPP”), named in the option. The Court of Appeal held (at [45]) that although DSPP then wrote to the appellant’s solicitors stating that they had no authority to act for the respondent in the sale and purchase of the property, this could not render the appellant’s exercise of the option, which was in accordance with its terms, to be invalid. The Court further held that the respondent should not be allowed to take advantage of his own breach of the option (by not giving DSPP the requisite authorisation to act as his solicitors in the sale and purchase of the property) to consequentially question the validity of the appellant’s exercise of the option. The Court thus granted specific performance of the contract for the sale and purchase of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Likewise in the present case, Subra Law was stated in Recital B of the Option as the defendant’s lawyers to receive the Remainder Sum and it was the defendant who had refused to authorise Subra Law to act for him in the sale and purchase of the Property. The defendant had prevented the claimants from exercising the Option and completing the sale and purchase of the Property. He was in breach of his obligation under the Option and cannot be allowed to take advantage of his own breach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Given the above, I then considered whether I should order specific performance as prayed for by the claimants, or damages in the alternative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Specific performance is a discretionary remedy that will only be ordered where it is just and equitable to do so. Factors that would affect the court’s exercise of discretion include whether damages would be an adequate remedy and whether the person against whom the relief of specific performance is being sought would suffer substantial hardship (<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present case, I granted specific performance and ordered that the defendant should sell and transfer the Property to the claimants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I found that damages would not be an adequate remedy because the Property was bought for the “personal enjoyment” of the claimants and not as a form of investment to sell with a view to making a profit (see <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners)</span> [2011] 2 SLR 232 at [106]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Beng Cheng v Lim Ngee Sing</span> [2016] 1 SLR 524 at [107]). The claimants were purchasing the Property with the intention of staying in it, having already sold their HDB flat. They had chosen the Property based on its location and size and their budget (see [3] above). I accepted that the claimants were ready, able and willing to complete the sale and purchase of the Property. They demonstrated this by sending a cheque for the Remainder Sum to Subra Law, the lawyers on record in the Option, and within the time stipulated in the Option. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I also found that the defendant’s reliance on his son’s autism as a reason to call off the sale and to argue that his family should not be forced to move out from the Property, which is their home, was insufficient to tilt the balance in favour of ordering damages in lieu of specific performance. First, the condition of the defendant’s son was known to him before he even contemplated selling the Property. The defendant confirmed before me that his son’s condition was a pre-existing condition and that he had agreed to sell the Property in spite of it.
