In my view, this must be correct since these facts constitute agreed facts before the court. However, the defendants submitted that the court may not take into consideration documents in an agreed bundle, the authenticity of which has been agreed. I disagreed with the defendants. Documents included in an agreed bundle without qualification stand as evidence in the case: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice</span> at para 34/3A/13. The court would be entitled to take such evidence into consideration. The weight to be given to documents in the agreed bundle is of course a separate matter. In the present case, there was no agreed bundle marked specifically as such. However, at the start of the trial, the parties agreed to the authenticity of most of the documents in each other’s bundle of documents.

<div class="txt-body text-left"> Defendant’s Submissions dated 14 December 2015 at paras 24 – 26. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I disagreed with the defendants’ submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The expression “account stated” can mean any one of the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A <span class="font-italic">mere account stated</span> is an absolute acknowledgement by a defendant of a debt owed to the plaintiff. There is no need for the plaintiff to communicate its acceptance of the acknowledgement to the defendant. The plaintiff may sue on the account as an independent cause of action. The defendant’s promise to pay is not binding as it is not supported by consideration but the plaintiff can rely on the defendant’s admission as evidence of the debt. The defendant is entitled to challenge the debt. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A <span class="font-italic">real account stated</span> is an agreement between two parties on the debts owing to each other, how the debts on each side are to be set off against each other and the balance payable. The consideration for the promise by the defendant to pay the balance is the discharge of the debts which have been set off. A real account stated is therefore a binding agreement between the parties in which there is an enforceable promise to pay. The plaintiff has to prove the agreement but need not prove the underlying debts. The defendant is entitled to show that the agreement is not binding on him on any of the grounds upon which an agreement can be set aside at law. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An <span class="font-italic">account stated for valuable consideration</span> is also a binding agreement between the parties in which there is an enforceable promise to pay. It is different from a real account stated in that (a) the debts are on one side only, and (b) the consideration is extrinsic, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, consent to wait for payment or a reduction in the amount of the claim (unlike a real account stated where the consideration is in the discharge of the debts on both sides). As with a real account stated, the plaintiff has to prove the agreement but does not have to prove the underlying debts. The defendant is entitled to show that the agreement is not binding on him on any of the grounds upon which an agreement can be set aside at law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See: <span class="font-italic">Gobind Lalwani v Basco Enterprise Pte Ltd</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 1019 (“<span class="font-italic">Basco</span><span class="font-italic">”) </span>at [7] – [10]; <span class="font-italic">Siqueira v Noronha </span>[1934] AC 332 at 337 – 338; <span class="font-italic">Harris and another v Charalambous</span> [2013] EWHC 1317 at [15]; <span class="font-italic">Atkin’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Encyclopaedia of Court Forms in Civil Proceedings</span> vol 12(2) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013 Issue) (“<span class="font-italic">Atkin’s Court Forms</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at paras 70 – 71.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Insofar as the burden of proof is concerned, the general principle remains that the person who asserts the existence of certain facts has the burden of proving that those facts exist. Therefore, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) where a plaintiff sues on a mere account stated, he has the burden of proving the account stated. This means he has to prove the defendant’s absolute acknowledgement of the debt. A defendant who challenges the debt has the burden of proving that he is not liable for the debt; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) where a plaintiff sues on a real account stated or an account stated for valuable consideration, the plaintiff has to prove the parties’ agreement to the account stated. A defendant who challenges the agreement bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to set aside the agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiff does not bear the burden of proving that the underlying debts exist where he sues on an account stated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The defendants referred me to two American cases – <span class="font-italic">Baltimore County, Maryland v Archway Motors, Inc</span>. 370 A.2d 113 (1977) (“<span class="font-italic">Baltimore County</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Gurney, Becker &amp; Bourne</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Inc. v Benderson Development Company, Inc</span>. 47 N.Y.2d 995 (1979) (“<span class="font-italic">Gurney</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>– in support of their proposition that the plaintiff had the burden of showing a pre-existing obligation to pay by the defendants. The defendants relied on statements in those cases to the effect that there can be no liability on an account stated if there is no existing debt. In my view, these two cases did not support the defendants’ argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In <span class="font-italic">Baltimore County</span>, the account stated was a letter from the plaintiff requesting payment by the defendant. The plaintiff argued that the defendant’s failure to object to the request for a year “constituted an admission of liability for an existing debt” (at 117). It was held that the plaintiff could not recover on an account stated because the defendant never became liable under the agreement pursuant to which the request for payment had been made. This was because a condition precedent in that agreement had not been fulfilled. In <span class="font-italic">Gurney</span>, the account stated was a letter from the plaintiff (a real estate agent) to the defendant (a landlord) for payment of commission in respect of a tenancy. The letter contained a notation that additional commission was payable if the tenant renewed the tenancy. It was held that an account stated could not arise because no commission was due on the renewal option which had not been exercised at the date of the letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Neither <span class="font-italic">Baltimore County </span>nor<span class="font-italic"> Gurney</span> discussed whether the burden was on the plaintiff to prove the existing debt in addition to the defendant’s admission of the debt. The evidence before the court in both cases showed that the debt did not exist. The accounts stated in <span class="font-italic">Baltimore County </span>and <span class="font-italic">Gurney</span> were in the nature of mere accounts stated. As discussed at [21(a)], the defendant is entitled to challenge the underlying debt in the case of a mere account stated. It is a defence to an action on a mere account stated that the account was stated in respect of a debt not then due, or not in existence, or for which the defendant is not liable: <span class="font-italic">Atkin’s Court Forms</span> at para 71. Therefore, the fact that the defendants in both <span class="font-italic">Baltimore County </span>and <span class="font-italic">Gurney </span>could not be liable on an account stated because the debt did not exist is consistent with the nature of a mere account stated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In my opinion, the Agreement in the present case was a mere account stated. The Agreement set out the amounts paid by the plaintiff to WE Bunker and the balance amount outstanding after deducting (a) the value of bunker delivered by WE Bunker to two vessels (the “AP07” and the “SEA DRAGON”), and (b) payments made by WE Bunker on the plaintiff’s behalf to two suppliers (“TELEEK” and “Platform”). In the Agreement, WE Bunker unequivocally admitted that it owed the plaintiff the balance amount of US$1,690,874.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff merely had to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the Agreement was signed by someone who had the authority to bind WE Bunker (and consequently, the defendants as partners in WE Bunker). This would be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>proof of the defendants’ acknowledgement of the debt. The plaintiff did not have to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the underlying debts existed. Instead, the defendants bore the burden of proving that the underlying debts did not exist or were not enforceable against them. The present case was similar to <span class="font-italic">Basco</span>, where the court held that it did not matter that the plaintiff in that case could not show how the amount stated in the account stated was arrived at; on the production of the account stated, the burden of disproving what was stated therein shifted to the defendant (at [24]). The defendant in that case made a submission of no case to answer and did not give evidence to dispute the debt. Judgment was therefore entered for the plaintiff (at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Nguyen was cross-examined extensively on the underlying debts and payments which the plaintiff said it made to WE Bunker.

</div> Nguyen’s evidence in this regard may have been less than satisfactory. However, it was not inherently incredible. In my view, the defendants’ cross-examination of Nguyen was not sufficient to rebut the plaintiff’s evidence that the payments had been made to WE bunker and that WE Bunker owed the plaintiff the amount stated in the Agreement.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I found that although the pleadings could have been clearer, it was apparent from paragraph 3 of the SOC that the plaintiff’s case was that Saiful and Tran signed the Agreement as WE Bunker’s agents. Paragraph 3 of the SOC states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In an account stated in writing titled Agreement of Account Balance Finalization duly signed by the Defendants’ Chief Operation Officer, Saiful Alam (full name Saiful Alam Bin Abdul Samad) and the Defendants’ Vietnam representative, Tran Quang Luong dated 30 April 2012, it was agreed that the Defendants owed the Plaintiffs the sum of US$1,690,874.00 which the Defendants promised to pay by 7 May 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It was evident from this paragraph that the plaintiff was relying on Saiful’s authority as WE Bunker’s COO, and on Tran’s authority as WE Bunker’s Vietnam representative. It would also have been clear to the defendants that this was the plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 There was no evidence Saiful and Tran had actual authority to bind WE Bunker. The question then was whether Saiful or Tran or both of them had apparent authority to bind WE Bunker. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Apparent authority arises from representations made by the principal to a third party. Representations may be express or implied from acquiescence or inactivity: <span class="font-italic">Viknesh Dairy Farm Pte Ltd v Balakrishnan s/o P</span><span class="font-italic"> S Maniam and others </span>[2015] SGHC 27 at [55]. The principal’s conduct as a whole must be considered in determining whether it made any representation to the third party: <span class="font-italic">Sigma Cable Co (Pte) Ltd v NEI Parsons Ltd </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 403 at [29].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The defendants submitted that they could not have made any representation to Nguyen that could have given rise to any apparent authority on the part of Saiful and/or Tran. During cross-examination, Nguyen admitted that the defendants never spoke to him.

</div>
</div> However, the plaintiff’s case was not based on any direct representation by the defendants. Express communication by the principal is not essential. In fact, it is the most infrequent instance of apparent authority because such an express communication is likely to give rise to <span class="font-italic">actual</span> authority: Tan Cheng Han, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> (Academy Publishing, 2010) at para 5.022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 There is ample support for the proposition that “[a] business card that is genuine and gives an agent’s status may… be an adequate representation”: <span class="font-italic">Bowstead &amp; Reynolds on Agency </span>(Peter G Watts gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2014)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 8-018.

In both these cases, the business card bore the principal company’s logo and address, and the agent’s designation, telephone and fax numbers: see <span class="font-italic">Martin</span> at [4.14] and <span class="font-italic">Heperu</span> at [26] respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The name card given by Saiful bore WE Bunker’s logo, its address, Saiful’s designation and his contact numbers. There was no reason for Nguyen to doubt the authenticity of Saiful’s card, especially since this was the second time he was receiving a name card from a WE Bunker employee. Nguyen had received Tran’s name card earlier in February 2011, when he had gotten to know Tran. The name cards of both Saiful and Tran were identical in design, down to the colour scheme and type of paper used. As the defendants did not give evidence, it was clear that the plaintiff had shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that Saiful’s name card was genuine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The defendants tried to challenge the plaintiff’s reliance on the name card by pointing to a letter dated 18 April 2011 from WE Bunker to Nguyen which was signed by Saiful as “Export Manager”.

The defendants also pointed out that the letter was addressed to Nguyen as “buyer” and the WE Bunker logo was different from that on the name cards that Nguyen received from Saiful and Tran. Nguyen explained that he had not noticed the different logo or Saiful’s title on the letter when he received the letter.

</div> Nguyen’s explanations about this letter were not entirely satisfactory. However, in the absence of evidence by the defendants, I was satisfied that the plaintiff had shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Saiful’s and Tran’s name cards were authentic and authorised or permitted by WE Bunker and that the plaintiff had relied on these cards; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) these name cards were representations by WE Bunker that Saiful and Tran were WE Bunker’s COO and Vietnam representative respectively.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">It was not inherently incredible that Nguyen did not register the fact that the logo and Saiful’s title on the letter were different from those on Saiful’s name card.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, were Saiful’s title as COO and/or Tran’s title as representative in Vietnam sufficient representation that either or both of them had the necessary authority to enter into the Agreement on behalf of WE Bunker? In my view, Saiful’s title as COO was a representation that he had a sufficiently senior appointment that carried with it the authority to bind WE Bunker. This representation would also have been affirmed by the fact that the first transaction was concluded successfully (see [9]). It bears reminding that, as pointed out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lena Leowardi</span>, the plaintiff only has to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case as opposed to proving its case on a balance of probabilities.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 However, I did not think that Tran’s designation as WE Bunker’s representative in Vietnam was sufficient to clothe him with apparent authority to bind WE Bunker. Tran’s role was to act as liaison between the plaintiff and WE Bunker for the purchase of oil. Nguyen would transfer the money and inform Tran, who would then issue a bill.

</div> They argued that Nguyen was not the legal representative of the plaintiff although he was the majority shareholder. In my view, the legal opinion did not support the defendants’ submission. The legal opinion merely said that an organization could initiate legal proceedings either by itself or its legal representative. The defendants did not cross-examine Mr Nguyen K Do. In the absence of any contrary evidence on Vietnamese law by the defendants, there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that the plaintiff had the legal capacity to bring this action.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiff’s alternative claim for money had and received </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my view, the plaintiff also succeeded in its alternative claim for money had and received. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The underlying basis for a claim for money had and received is subsumed under the rubric of unjust enrichment: <span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito</span><span class="font-italic"> and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 308 (at [125]). As the Court of Appeal went on to observe, unjust enrichment is the event and restitution the response to that event (at [126]). So to say one has “an action for money had and received” means that one claims restitution of money paid on the ground that there has been unjust enrichment. One such instance of unjust enrichment is “total failure of consideration”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As already discussed, the plaintiff has shown a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that Saiful had apparent authority to bind WE Bunker when he signed the Agreement. The Agreement was therefore evidence of WE Bunker’s admission of the amounts received from the plaintiffs. Taken together with the plaintiff’s evidence that WE Bunker failed to fulfil its obligations in respect of the balance amount of US$1,690,874, the Agreement was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence of the plaintiff’s claim for money had and received. The defendants did not challenge whether the failure of consideration was total.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Further, in their defence, the defendants admitted to having received certain amounts (albeit from parties who were not the plaintiff) and having paid certain amounts to third parties.

</div> I noted the coincidence between the amounts shown in the Agreement as having been paid to WE Bunker and some of the amounts which the defendants admitted to having received. I also noted the coincidence between the amounts credited to WE Bunker in the Agreement and some of the amounts which the defendants admitted to having paid.  These supported the plaintiff’s case that the defendants did receive the payments and called for an explanation by the defendants. The defendants chose not to adduce evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 A submission of no case to answer is a high-risk strategy. As long as there is “some <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence that supports the essential limbs of the plaintiff’s claim(s)”, the failure by the defendants to adduce evidence on their own behalf would be fatal: <span class="font-italic">Lim Swee Khiang and another v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and others</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 at [6]. In this case, the Agreement was strong evidence of the defendants’ liability to the plaintiff for the judgment sum once a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case was shown that Saiful was clothed with the authority to sign the Agreement and bind WE Bunker. The defendants had to give evidence if they disputed Saiful’s authority. They did not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As the defendants’ submission of no case to answer failed, I entered judgment for the plaintiff and awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at $80,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Defendants’ application for stay of proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On 1 February 2016, the defendants filed Summons 519 of 2016 for a stay of execution of the judgment. I heard the application on 11 February 2016 and ordered a stay of all execution proceedings on the condition that the defendants paid US$1 million into court within 21 days. The defendants have appealed against my decision granting a conditional stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is trite that while a successful plaintiff should not be deprived of its fruits of litigation, the court should also see that the defendant’s appeal, if successful, is not rendered nugatory.  To balance these competing interests, a stay will only be granted where special circumstances so require. This is usually the case where the appellant satisfies the court that if damages and costs are paid, there is no reasonable probability of getting them back in the event the appeal succeeds: <span class="font-italic">Lee Sian Hee (trading as Lee Sian Hee Pork Trader) v Oh Kheng Soon (trading as Ban Hon Trading Enterprises) </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 869 at [5].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The defendants submitted that the judgment should be stayed pending appeal for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the plaintiff had threatened bankruptcy proceedings against the defendants. In the defendants’ submission, the prejudice from being adjudged bankrupt would be irreversible even if the appeal succeeded.

The defendants argued that they have limited information about the plaintiff and that the plaintiff appears to conduct its business “in a manner that is highly questionable and unreliable”.

</div>
</div> For these reasons, the defendants feared being unable to recover their money in the event of a successful appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The defendants’ first ground leaned in favour of a stay. It has been held that granting a stay against a judgment creditor who is pursuing the winding-up of the judgment debtor ensures that the appeal is not rendered nugatory: <span class="font-italic">Cathay Theatres Pte Ltd v LKM Investment Holdings Pte</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 15 at [15]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 However, in my view, the defendants’ second ground was insufficient to warrant a stay. That the judgment creditor is a foreign company, making it inconvenient or expensive to seek recovery outside jurisdiction, is not a special circumstance warranting a stay: <span class="font-italic">Strandore Invest A/S and others v Soh Kim Wat </span>[2010] SGHC 174 at [13]; <span class="font-italic">Denis</span><span class="font-italic"> Matthew Harte v Tan Hun Hoe</span> <span class="font-italic">and Another </span>[2001] SGHC 19 at [64]. The defendants alleged that the plaintiff’s conduct of its business lacked accountability due to the absence of proper record keeping. The defendants’ main contention was that the plaintiff has “displayed an astounding lack of accountability in the manner they conducted their business transactions through their absence of paper documentation of such transactions”.

</div>
</div>  In my view, whilst the plaintiff’s record keeping could have been better, the defendants’ description overstated the matter.  In any event, I did not agree with the defendants’ submission that this meant that there was a risk that they would be unable to recover their money should the appeal succeed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As the plaintiff was agreeable to a stay on condition that the defendants pay $1m into court, I made an order in those terms. The order addressed the defendants’ concerns and ensured that the plaintiff would not be deprived of its judgment sum if the defendants failed in their appeal. As the defendants failed in their application for an unconditional stay, I awarded costs of the application to the plaintiff fixed at $1,500 inclusive of disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As stated earlier, the defendants have appealed against my decision to grant a conditional stay pending their appeal against my decision in the main action. I note that the Court of Appeal has concurrent jurisdiction to grant a stay of execution pursuant to O 57 r 15(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”). O 57 r 15(1) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.—(1) Except so far as the Court below or the Court of Appeal may otherwise direct —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) an appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the decision of the Court below; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) no intermediate act or proceedings shall be invalidated by an appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The application must be made in the first instance to the High Court: s 35 Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed); O 57 r 16(4) of the Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It is clear that if I had refused to grant a stay outright, the defendants would not have had to file an appeal but could make a fresh application to the Court of Appeal: <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> Civil Procedure 2016</span> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet and Maxwell, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">SCP 2016</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 57/15/7.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Should an applicant who is dissatisfied with the grant of a conditional stay file an appeal or make a fresh application to the Court of Appeal? It seems to me that the concurrent jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under O57 r 15(1) extends to <span class="font-italic">all</span> cases where the applicant does not succeed in obtaining <span class="font-italic">the stay order that he sought</span> from the High Court. It should not matter whether the High Court refused a stay outright or granted a conditional stay. From the perspective of a defendant seeking an unconditional stay, a conditional stay order means that his application for an unconditional stay has been refused. In the present case, for example, the defendants are in fact seeking an order from the Court of Appeal for an unconditional stay, which is the same application they would have made if I had refused a stay outright. It seems to me that the procedure should be the same in both instances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 An appeal is needed only where the judgment creditor is challenging a stay order (whether conditional or unconditional): <span class="font-italic">SCP 2016</span> at para 57/15/9. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This issue does not seem to have been decided by our courts.
