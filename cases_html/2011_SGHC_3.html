        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Wong Chong Yue, brings this suit
                    against his brother, the defendant, Wong Chong Thai, for a declaration that
                    their father Wong Shoa Ching (“Father”) had on 30 April 1993
                    created an express trust over 5311 shares in a company known as Malaya
                    Construction Co (Pte) Ltd (“MCC”) in favour of the plaintiff, the
                    defendant and their sister Mary Wong in equal shares. The defendant’s
                    defence is that the 5311 shares in MCC (the “shares”) were
                    transferred to him by their Father as a gift. The plaintiff also claims for
                    breach of contract to refund the sum of CAN$60,000.00 and US$189,250.39 which he
                    paid the defendant. The defendant denies that these were loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff had originally also claimed to be
                    beneficially entitled to a 50% share in 967 shares under a second express
                    trust created in favour of the plaintiff and the defendant. Their Father
                    transferred these in June 2000 to the defendant on trust for the plaintiff and
                    the defendant equally. This was evidenced by a letter produced in the course of
                    discovery dated 13 April 2000 by the Father to the defendant in the
                    following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To: Wong Chong Thai</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Re: Malaya Construction Co. Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Concerning the above company. I now informed [sic] you that my share of
                        the proceeds from the liquidation of [MCC], be divided equally between you
                        and Wong Chong Yue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dated this 13th day April, 2000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sgd</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">S.C. Wong</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is indisputably an express trust over “my [the
                    Father’s] share[s]” which was created in April 2000 and which
                    comprised the 967 shares which he then transferred to the defendant. The
                    defendant has admitted the same. Accordingly this is not an issue before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There are two issues to be determined in this
                    action: (i) whether the Father had created an express trust over the
                    5311 shares he transferred to the defendant on 30 April 1993, in
                    favour of the plaintiff, the defendant and their sister Mary Wong in equal
                    shares; and (ii) whether the plaintiff made the loans to the defendant and if so
                    their recoverability in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The family background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The family history is a complex one in which the
                    Father, now deceased, had in total four wives in Singapore and Hong Kong. In
                    Singapore his two wives were Ong Siew Yong, with whom he had three children (the
                    “OSY Line”), including one Wong Yue Yu ,and Lee Say Dee, with whom
                    he had three children (the “LSD Line”): the plaintiff, the
                    defendant and Mary Wong (the “LSD Line siblings”). The plaintiff,
                    who is the eldest son in the LSD Line, had worked for several years for the
                    Father in the family business in Sabah, Hong Kong and Singapore before migrating
                    to Canada in 1982. The trial revealed the plaintiff’s chequered
                    relationship with the defendant, with both of them working closely to defend
                    Wong Yue Yu’s lawsuit against the Father and the plaintiff in Originating
                    Summons 1245 of 1996 (“OS 1245”) but thereafter becoming
                    estranged. Both the plaintiff and defendant in turn had poor and adversarial
                    relations with Wong Yue Yu, their half-brother from the OSY Line. Wong Yue Yu
                    had had an affair with the plaintiff’s wife in Canada, which led to their
                    divorce. This unhappy extended family web cast a long shadow over the entire
                    trial and coloured the oral evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Father, the patriarch of the extended
                    family, owned and controlled MCC until he transferred the shares in the company
                    to his two sons from different wives on 30 April 1993. The Father had at
                    the same time transferred 5311 shares to Wong Yue Yu, who was the eldest
                    son of the OSY Line, and 5311 shares to the defendant, the second son of
                    the LSD Line. The Father retained 1 share, and 1 share was held by his
                    brother (the plaintiff and defendant’s uncle). The remaining outstanding
                    and issued shares of MCC comprised 967 shares which the Father had earlier
                    transferred to another wife, Cecilia Brown, in Hong Kong, and 150 shares
                    held by his wife Ong Siew Yong. Upon her decease, 75 shares devolved to the
                    Father and the balance 75 shares devolved to Wong Yue Yu and his OSY Line
                    siblings equally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Subsequently the Father had as part of his
                    divorce settlement with Cecilia Brown procured the return by her of
                    967 shares. The Father retained 100 shares and transferred
                    867 shares to the plaintiff. Wong Yue Yu filed OS 1245 against their
                    Father and the plaintiff for a declaration that the Father’s transfer
                    of 867 out of these 967 shares to the plaintiff was void, <em>inter alia</em>, because it was in breach of MCC’s
                    articles of association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The outcome of OS 1245 was that MCC was
                    ordered to be liquidated and its properties distributed amongst the
                    shareholders. The 967 MCC shares came to be registered in the name of the
                    defendant and were, upon the Father’s written instructions, held in trust
                    for the defendant and the plaintiff, as the defendant admits (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary Issue: Limitation Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I first deal with the preliminary issue of
                    whether the plaintiff’s claims for breach of trust and for account have
                    been time-barred under ss 22(1) and (2), and 6(2), respectively, of the
                    Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“Limitation Act”).
                    Section 22(1) and (2) of the Limitation Act reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Limitations of actions in respect
                            of trust property. 22.</b> —(1) No period of limitation
                        prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a beneficiary under a
                        trust, being an action —
                </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the
                            trustee was a party or privy; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof
                            in the possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee
                            and converted to his use.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Subject to subsection (1), an action by a beneficiary to recover trust
                        property or in respect of any breach of trust, not being an action for which
                        a period of limitation is prescribed by any other provision of this Act,
                        shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which
                        the right of action accrued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 6(2) of the Limitation Act reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) An action for an account shall not be brought in respect of any matter
                        which arose more than 6 years before the commencement of the
                        action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The meaning and scope of s 22(1)(b) was
                    examined in <em>Soar v Ashwell</em> [1893]
                    2 QB 390. Lord Esher MR said (at 393):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If there is created in expressed terms, whether written or verbal, a
                        trust, and a person is in terms nominated to be the trustee of that trust, a
                        Court of Equity, upon proof of such facts, will not allow him to vouch a
                        Statute of Limitations against a breach of that trust. Such a trust is in
                        equity called an express trust. If the only relation which it is proved the
                        defendant or person charged bears to the matter is a contractual relation,
                        he is not in the view of equity a trustee at all, but only a contractor; and
                        equity leaves the contractual relation to be determined by the common or
                        statute law. If the breach of the legal relation relied on, whether such
                        breach be by way of tort or contract, makes, in the view of a Court of
                        Equity, the defendant a trustee for the plaintiff, the Court of Equity
                        treats the defendant as a trustee become so by construction, and the trust
                        is called a constructive trust; and against the breach which by construction
                        creates the trust the Court of Equity allows Statutes of Limitation to be
                        vouched.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same judgment, Bowen LJ stated that (at 395 - 396):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question therefore arises whether the claim of the plaintiff can be
                        barred through lapse of time, by analogy to the Statute of Limitations. That
                        time (by analogy to the statute) is no bar in the case of an express trust,
                        but that it will be a bar in the case of a constructive trust, is a doctrine
                        which has been clearly and long established ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An express trust can only arise between the cestui que trust and his
                        trustee. A constructive trust is one which arises when a stranger to a trust
                        already constituted is held by the Court to be bound in good faith and in
                        conscience by the trust in consequence of his conduct and behaviour. Such
                        conduct and behaviour the Court construes as involving him in the duties and
                        responsibilities of a trustee, although but for such conduct and behaviour
                        he would be a stranger to the trust. A constructive trust is therefore, as
                        has been said, “a trust to be made out by circumstances”. It
                        is not unreasonable in the latter class of cases, where the liability of a
                        stranger to the trust arises from his conduct and depends on the proof of
                        his contemporary acts, that time should run in favour of the person to be
                        charged. In such cases conflicts of evidence are possible or probable, and
                        to deny to the person to be charged the shelter or benefit of a period of
                        limitation would be obviously dangerous and unjust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above passages have been cited with approval more recently by the
                    English High Court in <em>Cattley and anor v Pollard and
                        anor</em> [2007] 3 WLR 317 at [43] – [47]. A claim for
                    accounting under an express trust would accordingly not be subject to any time
                    bar, whether under s 6(2) or anywhere else in the Limitation Act.
                    Section 22(2) of the Limitation Act is subject to s 22(1) of the
                    Limitation Act, and therefore does not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     With respect to the plaintiff’s claim
                    for repayment of CAN$ 60,000 and US$ 189,250.39, such a claim,
                    independent of the trust, would be “founded on a contract” and is
                    thus time barred under s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act, which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Limitation of actions of contract and tort
                            and certain other actions. 6</b>.
                        —(1)   Subject to this Act, the following actions shall
                        not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which
                        the cause of action accrued:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)   actions founded on a contract or on tort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For completeness I will deal briefly with this claim later
                    (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I now turn to the main issue arising in this
                    suit, <em>ie</em>, whether the Father had created an
                    express trust over the 5311 shares transferred to the defendant in favour
                    of the LSD Line siblings in equal shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is noteworthy that the plaintiff has not
                    produced any document, written communication or letter of wishes of the Father
                    from which an express trust is to be construed. In sharp contrast there was
                    produced in discovery and admitted by the defendant that the Father by his own
                    hand had expressed a trust over the 967 MCC shares he had transferred to
                    the defendant in April 2000 (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above).
                    Further, nothing that was contemporaneous with the relevant instruments of
                    transfer, approval and registration of the 5331 shares by the Father to the
                    defendant in April 1993, and which even remotely suggests that there was a trust
                    intended by the Father then, was produced in evidence. When the Father later
                    transferred the 967 shares to the defendant in April 2000, he took the
                    trouble to expressly write a letter to the defendant expressing a trust over
                    these 967 shares in favour of the defendant and the plaintiff. The Father
                    said nothing in this letter relating back to the 5311 shares he had
                    previously transferred to the defendant in April 1993. The plaintiff admitted
                    under cross examination that there was no evidence of any trust for the benefit
                    of the LSD Line siblings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is also noteworthy that although the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors had informed Mary Wong that they reserved their
                    right to subpoena her in these proceedings, she has not been called as a
                    witness. With respect to Mary Wong’s interest in the 5311 shares, the
                    plaintiff’s evidence was contradictory. He took the position that the
                    defendant ought to give her something but deducting the value of the
                    mother’s house that had been transferred to Mary Wong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Mary Wong’s interests in
                    these shares depend on whether or not there is an express trust under which she
                    is to be a beneficiary. It does not in law depend on the decision or exercise of
                    discretion of either the plaintiff or defendant. To the extent that the
                    plaintiff was of the view that the defendant had such a discretion with respect
                    to Mary Wong’s entitlement, this would serve as a contra indication of any
                    trust for the three LSD Line siblings.</p>

                    claim. Both the plaintiff and the defendant had been engaged in preparing the

                    stated, <em>inter alia</em>, a position at variance with
                    the plaintiff’s claim of an express trust, was introduced:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.7 In about June 1992, I had already decided on a gift of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff first called Wong Yue Yu as a
                    witness who, after being sworn in, stated that he was not going to give any
                    evidence beyond what he had filed in OS 1245. The plaintiff then withdrew
                    this witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff then relied on a letter dated
                    5 February 1993 from the defendant to him as an admission by the defendant
                    that there exists an express trust as averred. The letter reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Chong Yue,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The list of shareholders and their shareholding of [MCC] is
                        enclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For your information, Madam Ong Siew Yong’s shares are divided (I
                        suspect) between [Wong Shoa Ching] and Madam Ong’s children equally.
                            <em>If all things remain equal, Tom’s [(Wong Yue
                            Yu)] group has more shares than us, meaning Tom’s 5386 against our
                            5311 ..</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff argued that the defendant, by referring to the
                    5311 shares as “our 5311”, has thereby admitted that the
                    defendant was merely a trustee of the shares for the plaintiff, the defendant,
                    and their sister, Mary Wong. The starting point is that this is not a letter
                    from the Father. Further, the context and tenor of the letter will determine the
                    meaning and scope of the expression, “our 5311”. The entire
                    letter relates to the shareholdings in MCC and it arose in the context of the
                    OS 1245 litigation by Wong Yue Yu against the Father and the plaintiff,
                    concerning the 967 shares originally held by Cecilia Brown and out of which
                    the Father had transferred 867 shares to the plaintiff and retained
                    100 shares in his own name (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    above). The plaintiff and the defendant had together assisted their Father in
                    his affidavits and legal defence (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    above). In this letter the defendant states clearly that he suspects that the
                    shares originally held by Ong Siew Yong (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) are divided between their Father and the OSY Line
                    children equally. Then he goes on to say that if all things remain equal,
                    “Tom’s [Wong Yue Yu] group”, <em>ie</em>, the OSY Line, has more shares than “us”. The
                    letter is addressed to the plaintiff and makes no reference to Mary Wong.
                    Nothing in this letter construed in context suggests any admission by the
                    defendant that he holds these shares on trust for the three LSD Line siblings
                    equally. On the contrary, it reiterates the defendant’s anxiety not to be
                    outvoted by the OSY Line and, in particular, Wong Yue Yu, which presumably was
                    an anxiety shared by the plaintiff at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It was in this context that the defendant was
                    urging the plaintiff to convince their Father to transfer Cecilia Brown’s
                    shares to the plaintiff so that the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s
                    combined shareholding in MCC would be not be exceeded by the OSY Line’s
                    shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     What emerges from the above is that the
                    plaintiff appears to have formed an expectation that, as he was the eldest son
                    in the LSD Line and had worked for the family business before he emigrated to
                    Canada, and because he had helped the Father and the defendant to defend the
                    OS 1245 action and provided some of the litigation costs, the Father ought
                    to have given him a more significant inheritance than what he had already
                    received from the Father, namely, a half interest in 967 MCC shares (see
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) and his business and assets in
                    Ningbo, China. In the absence of any expression of a trust by the Father over
                    the 5311 shares transferred to the defendant in 1993, and given that the
                    Father was fully capable up to the year 2000 of expressing a trust in writing
                    over the 967 shares, on the evidence produced in court, I found no
                    evidence, that would suggest any trust over the 5311 shares transferred
                    absolutely to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff’s second claim is for
                    repayment of CAN$ 60,000.00 in cash and US$ 189,250.39 which he says he paid to
                    the defendant in connection with the legal costs of OS 1245. The defendant
                    denied that these payments were loans and put the plaintiff to proof thereof. He
                    explained these payments as being funds provided principally by the Father and
                    also funds provided by the defendant for legal costs in OS 1245. Wong Yue
                    Yu had taken legal action in OS 1245 principally against the Father and the
                    plaintiff to block the Father’s transfer of 976 shares to the
                    plaintiff and 100 shares to himself. The plaintiff adduced evidence of
                    other payments and remittances from the Father, the relationship of which to the
                    plaintiff’s second claim remains unclear. These reveal that payments had
                    been made or procured on behalf of the Father for a multiplicity of purposes
                    including but not limited to the legal costs but also for MCC payables and in
                    respect of the relevant properties. The plaintiff’s claim of having given
                    the defendant CAN$ 60,000 in cash is disputed by the defendant and only
                    admitted to the extent of S$ 31,000 which was used for purposes of property
                    tax payments. The plaintiff was unable to clearly establish that the
                    US$ 189,250.39 payment was a loan and not payment of his share of the legal
                    costs in OS 1245. In his own words, had he had known at the time, that he
                    was to have no legal or beneficial interest in these shares he would not have
                    provided these payments. His expectations at the time does not have the effect
                    of creating a trust where none otherwise exists. In the premises I am unable to
                    conclude that the plaintiff made these payments as loans to the defendant, quite
                    apart from their being barred by limitation (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff’s action for a declaration
                    of an express trust in respect of the 5311 shares held by the defendant is
                    dismissed. Costs of this action to be taxed to the defendant.</p>
