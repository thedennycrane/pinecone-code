<b>B.    FIRST INFORMATION REPORT</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    On 30 April 2009, at about 3.50pm, the victim lodged a police
                            report at the Criminal Investigation Department, in which she stated
                            that between the year 2000 and mid-2007, she had been molested by her
                            brother on several occasions. The victim also stated that the accused
                            had begun to rape her, at their residence, from sometime in either 2005
                            or 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    The accused was thereafter arrested on 2 June 2009, at about
                            4.50pm, at the Serious Sexual Crimes Branch of the Criminal
                            Investigation Department.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    The victim’s immediate family consists of her parents and
                            two older brothers. The accused is the eldest son of the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    At [address redacted], the victim’s father occupied the
                            master bedroom, while the victim’s mother slept on the living
                            room sofa. This was due to the fact that the victim’s parents
                            were estranged and on poor terms. The accused and the victim shared the
                            other bedroom in the flat: the accused slept on the only bed in the
                            room, while the victim slept on a pull-out mattress placed on the floor
                            adjacent to the accused’s bed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    On a night sometime in the year 2005 or 2006, both the accused and the
                            victim were in their shared bedroom at [address redacted]. The accused
                            was lying on his bed and the victim was lying on her mattress. The
                            accused then came over to where the victim lay on her mattress. Assuming
                            that the victim was asleep, the accused then inserted his hand into the
                            victim’s panties, and used his hand to rub on the
                            victim’s vulva and clitoris. The accused admitted that he felt
                            aroused and excited whilst touching the victim in this manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Unbeknownst to the accused, the victim was awake and aware of that the
                            accused was touching her. However, out of fear and embarrassment, the
                            victim refrained from stirring, in order not to alert the accused to the
                            fact that she was awake.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    In addition to stroking her vulva with his hand, the accused also
                            began to touch the victim’s bare breasts by sliding his hands
                            under her top. The accused also caressed and sucked on the
                            victim’s nipples. The accused then inserted his finger into
                            the victim’s vagina whilst she lay on her mattress in their
                            shared bedroom at night.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    The above acts were carried out, at night, whilst all of the lights in
                            the bedroom were switched off. When the accused committed the acts of
                            molest against the victim, he had assumed that the victim had remained
                            asleep throughout the entire episode.</p>

                                AND 3<sup>rd</sup> CHARGES (RAPE)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    On a night sometime in the year 2007, the accused and the victim were
                            again in their shared bedroom at [address redacted]. At around midnight,
                            the accused went to where the victim lay on her mattress, in the
                            darkness, and proceeded to remove all of the victim’s
                            clothing. As the victim did not appear to move, the accused assumed that
                            the victim was asleep. The accused then turned the victim so that she
                            lay facing up, spread her legs apart, and kneeled in between her thighs.
                            He then began to rub, grope, lick and suck on the victim’s
                            breasts and nipples. The accused also inserted a finger into the
                            victim’s vagina and began to move it in and out of the
                            vagina.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    When the victim did not stir, the accused then undressed completely
                            and guided his erect penis into the victim’s vagina with his
                            right hand. He began moving his hips and thrusting his penis repeatedly
                            in and out of the victim’s vagina, supporting his weight by
                            resting his palms at the side of the victim’s body. The
                            accused did not use a condom or any other contraceptive devices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    The accused raped the victim again on a second occasion sometime in
                            the year 2007. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.    Although the victim was awake and aware of what the accused was doing
                            on the second occasion as well, she once again remained still due to her
                            fear of the accused, as well as due to the fact that she felt
                            embarrassed by the sexual abuse perpetrated by the accused on her. The
                            victim did not at any time consent to having sexual intercourse with the
                            accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.    The accused admitted that he enjoyed having sexual intercourse with
                            the victim, even though he was aware that she had not consented to the
                            said sexual intercourse, and that it was wrong for him to have forced
                            himself on her in such a manner. Prior to each act of sexual abuse
                            committed on the victim, the accused had viewed pornographic material
                            via the Internet, and felt the urge to touch a female. He would
                            thereafter ensure (so he thought) that the victim was asleep, before
                            starting to molest and rape her. The accused therefore continued to have
                            sexual intercourse with the victim as he could not resist his sexual
                            urges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.    …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>E.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">i.    
              <b>Confrontation and violence between the accused and
                                the victim</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.    Sometime in 2007, at [address redacted], the victim confronted the
                            accused and threatened to tell their parents that he had been having
                            sexual intercourse with her without her consent. Their parents were not
                            at home at the time. The accused was shocked that the victim was aware
                            of the sexual abuse he had committed on her, and surmised that she had
                            not been asleep after all when he committed the acts of molest and rape
                            on her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.    The accused immediately began punching the victim on her face and body
                            several times, in response to her threat to inform their parents. The
                            victim quickly ran out of the flat and ran to a neighbouring flat for
                            assistance, where she called both the police and their parents. When
                            their parents and the police returned to the flat, the accused admitted
                            that he had assaulted the victim, but did not mention that he had done
                            so after having been confronted by the victim. The police subsequently
                            advised the victim’s parents to apply for a Personal
                            Protection Order (‘PPO’) on behalf of the victim.
                            However, the victim’s parents eventually decided against
                            applying for the said PPO.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>ii</b>.    
              <b>Discovery of the offences</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24.    At the end of 2007, the victim ran away from her home at [address
                            redacted] as she could not endure the incidents of molest and rape
                            committed by the accused against her any further. She did not tell her
                            parents that the accused was raping her as she felt that her parents
                            were unsympathetic to her, and would either not believe her or not do
                            anything (a feeling partly engendered by their decision not to apply for
                            a PPO on her behalf against the accused). The victim therefore went to
                            stay with her then-boyfriend at his residence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25.    The victim continued to reside with her then-boyfriend until April
                            2009, when she finally informed her secondary school principal about the
                            incidents of molest and rape committed by the accused on her. The
                            principal and school counsellor duly informed the police about the
                            matter, after which the victim formally lodged a police report against
                            the accused on 30 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>F.    MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE VICTIM</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26.    The victim was examined on 5 May 2009 by Dr. [D], an
                            Associate Consultant at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at
                            [hospital 1]. In a medical report dated 20 May 2009, Dr. [D]
                            stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    Clinical examination of the victim’s breast and abdomen
                                were normal;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    Pelvic examination revealed multiple old hymenal tears;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.    The victim’s urine pregnancy test was negative;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">d.    Screening for common STD’s were negative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>G.    MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF THE ACCUSED</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.    The accused was examined on 14 July 2009 by Dr. [E], a
                            Consultant at the Department of Urology at [hospital 2]. In a medical
                            report dated 14 August 2009, Dr. [E] stated that the
                            accused did not have erectile dysfunction.</p>

<b>H.    FACTS RELATING TO THE TRAFFIC CHARGES (7th
                                – 9th CHARGES)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.    The complainant is Senior Staff Sergeant Kheong Yew Ming, attached to
                            the Tanglin Police Division of the Singapore Police Force.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29.    In the early morning of 30 January 2009, the complainant was
                            performing road-block duties along Farrer Road. At about 3.33 am, the
                            accused, who was riding a motorcycle bearing registration number [XXX]
                            along Farrer Road, was stopped by the complainant at the said
                            road-block. Upon conducting a check, the complainant discovered that the
                            accused did not possess a valid Class 2B driving licence in respect of
                            the motorcycle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    Investigations revealed that the said motorcycle bearing registration
                            number [XXX] was registered to one [C], the accused’s father.
                            On 30 January 2009, the accused had taken the ignition keys of
                            the said motorcycle without the consent or permission of his father. The
                            accused thereafter took the motorcycle from their residence [address
                            redacted] and rode the said motorcycle, until he was stopped by the
                            complainant at the road-block along Farrer Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       AGG pleaded for a lighter sentence. He said that he was extremely remorseful.
                    He was a hooligan a few years ago but had changed. He wanted to finish his
                    national service. He was concerned about his mother and grandmother who were
                    seriously ill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       AGG had previous convictions in 2002 in respect of uncensored or obscene
                    films, voluntarily causing hurt and theft for which he was asked to reside in a
                    juvenile home. I did not enhance his sentence because of these prior offences as
                    they were different in nature from the offences of outrage of modesty and rape.
                    However, they demonstrated that he had had a brush with the law before. Instead
                    of changing his ways, he had gravitated to the more serious offences of outrage
                    of modesty and rape.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       There is only one other case of rape by a sibling of a young age. This was
                        <em>PP v S</em> [2003] SGHC 70
                        (“<em>PP v S</em>”) in which I
                    had convicted the accused on his plea of guilt in respect of rape under
                    s 376(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). I
                    said at [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I took into account the fact that the accused was in a position of
                        responsibility and trust vis-à-vis the victims but he was not their parent
                        and he was of a young age. I also took into account the fact that he had
                        sexually abused not one but three of his siblings in various ways on various
                        occasions over a number of years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In that case, I sentenced the accused to ten years’ imprisonment and
                    12 strokes of the cane for each of the two charges under s 376(2) of
                    the Penal Code with the sentences for each of these two charges to run
                    consecutively making a total of 20 years of imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       However, in <em>PP v S</em>, there were three victims and
                    the charge was under the more serious s 376(2) rather than
                    s 376(1) of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On the other hand, AGG, while professing to be remorseful, had escalated his
                    sexual offences from outrage of modesty to rape and had assaulted B when she
                    confronted him instead of feeling shame and remorse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the circumstances and being mindful of his young age, I sentenced AGG to 12
                    years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on each of the charges
                    under s 376(1) and one year’s imprisonment and three strokes
                    of the cane for the charge under s 354 of the Penal Code. While the
                    sentence of ten years’ imprisonment on each of the s 376(2)
                    charges in <em>PP v S</em> might appear lower than that of
                    12 years’ imprisonment for each of the s 376(1) charges in
                    the present case before me, it must be remembered that in <em>PP
                        v S</em>, I had ordered the two stiffest sentences to run
                    consecutively making a total of 20 years whereas I was not minded to do that for
                    the present case. Accordingly, the total imprisonment for AGG was in fact 13
                    years’ imprisonment, <em>ie</em>, the sentence of
                    one year for the sixth charge (under s 354) was to run consecutively
                    with the sentence of 12 years for the second charge (under s 376(1))
                    which was in turn to commence from 4 June 2009, the date of remand. On
                    the totality principle, I was of the view that the conduct of the accused person
                    in <em>PP v S</em> was more heinous than that of AGG. This
                    explains why the total imprisonment for AGG was less than that in <em>PP v S</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As for each of the seventh to ninth charges, I sentenced AGG to a fine of $600
                    and in default, six days’ imprisonment. I added the mandatory
                    disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road
                    Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) for 12 months from the date
                    of conviction, <em>ie</em>, 19 February 2010 for
                    the ninth charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     AGG has filed an appeal against the sentence.</p>
