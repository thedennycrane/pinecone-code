        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
is an appeal by the executors of Yap Kiat Cheong (“Yap”). The executors
are also Yap’s niece and nephew. Yap married Hou Wa Yi (“Hou”),
a Chinese national, on 30 September 1992. Hou filed for divorce and
was granted a decree nisi on 26 September 2006. The ancillary matters were
concluded on 5 November 2009 and Hou being dissatisfied appealed against
the District Court’s ancillary matters orders. Yap died on 8 February 2011.
The appeal was adjourned part-heard by Justice Philip Pillai on 22 March
2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Probate
was granted on 29 March 2011. The appellants were appointed as executors
under a will made by Yap on 26 January 2002. They applied to intervene
and sought an order to make the decree nisi absolute. The district
judge dismissed the application on the ground that s 7 of the Women’s
Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Women’s Charter”) specifically
provides —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>7</b>.    Every marriage solemnized in Singapore after 15 September
1961, other than a marriage which is void under the provisions of
this Act, shall continue until dissolved —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    by the death of one of the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    by order of a court of competent jurisdiction;
or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    by a declaration made by a court of
competent jurisdiction that the marriage is null and void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Yap’s death thus dissolved the marriage and the court no longer
had the jurisdiction or power to make the decree nisi absolute.
This appeal thus raises this sole issue: does the court have the
power to make absolute a decree nisi after the death of one of the
parties to the divorce proceedings?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There
is no reported case in Singapore on this point but the issue was raised
in the English case of <em>Stanhope v Stanhope</em> (1886)
11 PD 103 (“<em>Stanhope</em>”). In that
case, the husband died after the decree nisi was granted and before
it was made absolute. The husband’s executor subsequently applied
for the decree nisi to be made absolute. The Court of Appeal held
that the executor could not revive the suit for the purpose of applying
to make the decree nisi absolute. Bowen LJ held at 108:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A man can no more be divorced after his
death than he can after his death be married or sentenced to death.
Marriage is a union of husband and wife for their joint lives unless
it be dissolved sooner, and the Court cannot dissolve a union which
has already been determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       
          <em>Stanhope</em> was applied by the English Court
of Appeal in <em>In re Seaford, Decd</em> [1968]
1 P 53 (“<em>Seaford</em>”) and the Malaysian
court in <em>Suci Mathews v Thomas Mathews</em> [1985]
2 MLJ 228. I agree with the decision in <em>Stanhope</em> and
the cases that followed. As Wilmer LJ held in <em>Seaford
at 6</em>9 —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The death of the husband not only caused
the suit to abate; it destroyed the cause of Action, and there was
no longer any subject-matter to which the purported decree absolute
could apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
decree nisi is an inchoate order and, until it is made absolute, may
be overtaken by the event of death. The proper reading of s 7 of
the Women’s Charter is that a marriage is dissolved on the occurrence
of any of the three events stipulated in s 7(a)–(c). Death of a
party to the marriage and a court order are two such events. The
court order finally dissolving a marriage is the decree absolute
and not the decree nisi because the decree nisi will not dissolve
the marriage if the court has reasons not to grant the decree absolute,
rare as that may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Counsel
for the appellants submitted that under s 99(3) of the Women’s Charter,
it was incumbent on Hou to apply for the decree absolute but she
failed to do so, such that the appellants were entitled to apply
for and obtain the decree absolute as the decree nisi could and
should be made absolute, particularly since the ancillary matters
orders were already made. Section 99(3) does not assist the appellants
because it applies only if the death of a party to the marriage
had not intervened. Section 99 concerns applications to make decree
nisi absolute and the powers of the court after hearing the parties,
which include rescinding the decree nisi or making it absolute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Counsel
for the appellants also submitted that the case of <em>Sivakolunthu
Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah and another</em> [1987] SLR(R) 702
(“<em>Sivakolunthu</em>”) makes it clear
that a decree nisi legally terminates the marriage. Counsel’s reliance
on <em>Sivakolunthu</em> is misplaced. The
court in <em>Sivakolunthu</em> did not say
that a decree nisi legally terminates a marriage. The court only
held at [24]–[25] that the decree nisi practically terminates the
marriage. Furthermore, the court was not considering the same issue
presently raised. Instead, the issue before the court there was whether
an order for the division of matrimonial assets made under s 106(1)
of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1970 Rev Ed) was valid and enforceable
when made upon a decree nisi. The court had to interpret s 106(1)
of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1970 Rev Ed), not s 7 of the Women’s
Charter which is the Section in issue here. <em>Sivakolunthu</em> must
not be read out of context to stand for more than it Actually does.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       What
effect this decision would have on the ancillary matters and the part-heard
appeal are not issues before me and I thus express no opinion in that
regard. For the reasons above, this appeal is dismissed.</p>
