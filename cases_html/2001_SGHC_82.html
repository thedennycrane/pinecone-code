<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The accused is a 26-year old Indian national who worked as a driver for a

commercial company in Singapore. He has been here from 1995 or so. He was charged with the rape and

molest of a 58-year old complainant. He was not represented by counsel at trial, having discharged

the two counsel assigned to him by the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. They had represented him up to the

end of the Preliminary Inquiry. The evidence against him was mainly from the complainant herself.

She works as a cleaner by day and from 7pm to about 9pm or 10pm she would help at her husbands

food-stall. She usually uses a footpath alongside the Bendemeer Secondary School to get to and from

her husbands food-stall at Whampoa. She lives with her husband and 30-year old son at St Georges

Avenue. Her 28-year old married daughter lives elsewhere.</p>
<p align="justify">2. On 31 July 2000 the complainant left her husbands food-stall early to get

some health products from a shop at Balestier Road. She left the shop near to closing time at 10pm.

She alighted from the bus she was travelling in and walked across an overhead bridge coming down at

the footpath that she uses to go home. The footpath was between the Bendemeer Secondary School and a

row of trees and shrubs. These can be seen from the photographs of the scene tendered by the

prosecution. She testified that she saw the accused at the overhead bridge on the (footpaths

side) plucking leaves as she walked by. After she had passed him she was shortly attacked from

behind. A man grabbed her round the neck and cupped his other hand over her mouth. She was dragged

into the nearby bushes where he pulled her pants down and raped her. In the course of this attack he

also pressed her breast. That was the subject of the second charge against the accused in this trial

before me.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The complainant managed to say a few words in Malay to the assailant. She

pleaded, "Tolong! Tolong!", but the attacker just said "Buka" and "Diam".

After the rape he said to her, "Shiok, Shiok" and then "Aunty, sorry", and

helped her find her shoes. After that he calmly walked off along the footpath in a slow and

deliberate manner. The complainant said that because of that and the light from the lamp-posts along

the footpath she could see his face clearly although it was a side profile. She was certain that she

could see his eyes, nose and face. She described him as fairly dark-skinned with no beard or

moustache; and that he was wearing a dark pair of pants and dark shirt.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The complainant then went home but was afraid to tell anyone what had

happened. However, at midnight she telephoned her daughter and told her that she had lost her pager.

The manner and cryptic nature of the call aroused her daughters suspicion and after further

enquiry, she told her daughter that she had been molested. The daughter was subsequently told the

full story and it was she who made the police report which resulted in the police rape investigation

squad going by the complainants home to begin their investigation. The complainant had in the

meantime, soaked all the clothing she had worn on the evening of 31 July 2000. Consequently, Mdm

Renuka Sornarajah from the Department of Scientific Services reported that she was unable to lift

any trace of semen or blood from them. She testified that it is possible that soaking the clothing

in water may remove any trace of those matter.</p>
<p align="justify">5. On 16 November 2000 she attended an identification parade held by the police.

There were nine Indians in the line up. She identified the accused as the person who assaulted and

raped her on 31 July 2000. The accused challenged this evidence as vigorously as he challenged her

testimony that she saw his face after the rape. He stated that at the time of the identification

parade he was sporting a beard and moustache just as he has at the trial. Therefore, he questioned

the complainants testimony that her assailant was clean-shaven on the night of the attack. The

complainant said that the beard and moustache could have been worn after the incident; but she was

steadfast in her identification of the accused. From my own observation of the accused at trial I am

of the view that the beard and moustache of the accused were very thin and hardly concealed his

face.</p>
<p align="justify">6. I called upon the defence and the accused elected to testify. He had no other

witness other than himself. His testimony was very short and consisted of a denial that he was at

the scene of the crime. He offered no evidence as to where he was at the material time. The

prosecutor applied to introduce the cautioned statement of the accused to impeach his testimony. The

statement was recorded on 8 December 2000. The accused challenged the use of the statement and an

inquiry was therefore commenced to ascertain the voluntariness of that statement. It appears that

more than one statement had been recorded from the accused although the prosecution sought to

introduce only the cautioned statement in respect of the second charge. The accused was clearly

confused in respect of the circumstances of the recording of his statements. Some of his assertions

appear to be out of place. When the CIDs Tamil interpreter, Miss Jeyaletchumi gave evidence, even

she appeared to me to be unsure as to which interviews some of the statements referred to by the

accused were made. In such a case, I think that the prosecution was at least bound to set out the

evidence clearly as to how many statements were recorded and the dates when those statements were

taken. If there were some threat inducement or promise which might have occurred in a previous

statement recorded shortly before the one in question, the accused might be entitled to the benefit

of doubt. Furthermore, it appears that the recording officer had enlisted the assistance of a man

called Devarrajan, known as "Roy" to the accused to speak to the accused in the presence

of the recording officer. It is not entirely clear what role this man, who is not a member of the

CID, was supposed to play and what exactly it was that he said. It was not disputed by the

prosecution that Roy was present in one if not more of the sessions when a statement was about to be

recorded from the accused. The accused alleged that Roy gave various advice and made some

representations to him concerning the matters in this trial as well as other matters. Although Roy

was clearly not a person in authority, his presence and nebulous function must be clearly explained,

and they were not explained to my satisfaction. Consequently, I am not satisfied that the cautioned

statement was made voluntarily by the accused and ruled it inadmissible.</p>
<p align="justify">7. There was really only one issue at the trial, namely, whether there could

reasonably be a mistake on the part of the complainant in the identification of the accused as the

man who attacked her. The complainant identified the accused from a parade of nine men about three

and a half months after the event, but was able to pick him out. She appeared to me to have no

difficulty in identifying him then or in court. Her testimony was lucid and sure. There is no rule

that an accused cannot be convicted on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness. It is only

incumbent upon the court to satisfy itself that the evidence of this solitary eye witness

sufficiently identifies the accused, and that nothing in his testimony or other extraneous evidence

indicates that there may a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the identification. In this case,

I am satisfied with the evidence of the complainant. The accused was unable to raise any reasonable

doubt in my mind as to the case of the prosecution.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him on both

charges. In sentencing him, I had taken into account the fact that the offence of molest was

committed in the course of the rape. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the sentence of

imprisonment in respect of the second charge should be served concurrently with that of the first.

The accused was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in respect the first

charge and two years imprisonment and two strokes of the cane in respect of the third charge.</p>
