<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Tan Chin Hock, was convicted by a
                    High Court judge (“the trial judge”) of having in his possession
                    64.34g of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking, an offence under
                        s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) read with s 5(2) of the
                    Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”)
                    and punishable under s 33 of the MDA (see <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Tan Chin Hock</em> [2009] SGHC 189 (“the
                    GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant appealed against the trial
                    judge’s decision. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, we
                    dismissed the appeal as there was, in our view, no reasonable doubt that the
                    appellant was guilty of the offence which he was convicted of. We also said that
                    we would give our reasons for dismissing the appeal; we now set out those
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The findings of fact of the trial judge are set
                    out succinctly at [2]–[4] of the GD, which are reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    The evidence showed that the [appellant] was
                            arrested at 9.45am on 28 March 2008 when officers of the Central
                            Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) entered his flat and broke into
                            his room. He was found holding a maroon coloured bag in which the CNB
                            officers found 36 packets of white substance subsequently ascertained to
                            be heroin. More heroin was found elsewhere in his room[,] … the
                            aggregate of which formed the subject matter of the first charge [this
                            was also the sole charge which the Prosecution proceeded with at the
                            trial]. The CNB officers also found drug trafficking materials, namely,
                            a weighing scale, a pair of scissors and some small plastic sachets.
                            Several other persons were also arrested at about the same time. They
                            were later ascertained not to be concerned with the charges involving
                            the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    The prosecution also adduced seven statements made
                            by the [appellant] in which he gave detailed accounts of how he came to
                            be staying at the flat, and how he came into the business of drug
                            trafficking. These included details of his own addiction, how he was
                            introduced to his supplier, and also the persons to whom he delivered
                            drugs to. He obtained his supply from a Malaysian man known to him only
                            as “Ah Seng”. He started delivering drugs for Ah Seng in
                            February 2008. The drugs would be sent by courier to the car park near
                            Blk 322, Ubi Avenue 1. Ah Seng would send heroin, Ecstasy
                            tablets, Ice, and Erimin-5, all wrapped in black tape. Ah Seng would
                            notify the [appellant] whenever anyone wanted to take delivery. The
                            [appellant] would then follow Ah Seng’s instructions to make the
                            delivery and collect payment on his behalf. He was paid $150 for each
                            delivery he made. He made about 7 or 8 deliveries a week. He admitted
                            that he had just collected a batch of drugs from Ah Seng’s courier
                            on the morning of the day of his arrest. The drugs were meant to be
                            collected from him sometime later but no instructions had been received
                            at the time. The [appellant] merely checked the bundles and weighed them
                            as instructed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    The [appellant] did not challenge any of the
                            evidence[,] having instructed his counsel that he would plead guilty to
                            the charge. At the close of the prosecution’s case, counsel
                            declined to make any submission. I then called upon the defence and the
                            [appellant] elected to remain silent. His counsel again declined to make
                            any submission. On the evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution
                            had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and I thus convicted the
                            [appellant] and sentenced him to death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On appeal, the appellant did not dispute the
                    trial judge’s findings of fact and also did not dispute that he had
                    elected to remain silent when his defence was called. Although the trial judge
                    did not, in the GD, refer specifically to the evidence led by the Prosecution on
                    the scientific analysis carried out on the “36 packets of white
                    substance” (see [2] of the GD) found in the possession of the appellant
                    at the time of his arrest (“the White Substance”), the record of
                    proceedings showed that the Prosecution produced 22 certificates of analysis
                    issued under s 16 of the MDA as proof of the type and the quantity of
                    controlled drug contained in the White Substance. For convenience, we shall
                    hereafter refer to these 22 certificates collectively as
                    “P67–P88”, and to a certificate issued under s 16 of
                    the MDA as a “s 16 MDA certificate”. A prosecution witness,
                    Ms Lim Jong Lee Wendy (“PW5”), an analyst employed by the
                    Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”), testified that P67–P88
                    were signed by her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the trial, the appellant did not challenge
                    the validity of P67–P88. On appeal to this court, however, the appellant
                    mounted such a challenge on the ground that PW5 had not explained precisely the
                    steps taken to test the White Substance. It was argued that as a result of
                    PW5’s failure in this regard, the Prosecution had failed to comply with
                    the requirements of the law (as understood by the appellant (see further
                        <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> below)) and, consequently, the Prosecution had not proved
                    beyond reasonable doubt the type and the quantity of controlled drug contained
                    in the White Substance. In essence, the appellant’s case before this court
                    was that it was unsafe for the court to rely on P67–P88 as presumptive
                    proof of the type and the quantity of controlled drug contained in the White
                    Substance because:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]here is no evidence whatever as to who conducted the laboratory tests
                        on the [White Substance] or what method was used or in any event how the
                        tests were done. We [have] not [been] made aware whether [it was] the
                        Analyst herself, PW5, who did the tests or whether it was someone else. We
                        do not even have any evidence on record whether PW5 supervised the testing
                        of the [White Substance].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellant’s argument as outlined above
                    was based on certain observations made by the judge who heard the
                    magistrate’s appeal in <em>Lim Boon Keong v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2010] 4 SLR 451 (“<em>Lim
                        Boon Keong</em>”). We rejected the argument and dismissed the
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision in <em>Lim Boon Keong</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       To better understand the appellant’s case
                    before this court, which (as just mentioned) hinged upon certain <em>obiter dicta</em> of the judge in <em>Lim Boon
                        Keong</em> (“the MA judge”), we shall first discuss that
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The accused in <em>Lim Boon
                        Keong</em> (“Lim”) was convicted in the District Court
                    of the offence under s 8(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MDA of
                    unauthorised consumption of a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to
                    the MDA, namely, norketamine (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim
                        Boon Keong</em> [2009] SGDC 511). The district judge who heard the
                    trial (“the District Judge”) found that the procedure set out in
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA for testing
                    Lim’s urine sample for the presence of norketamine had been complied with,
                    and, thus, the presumption under s 22 of the MDA (“the s 22 MDA
                    presumption”) that Lim had consumed norketamine was applicable. In
                    convicting Lim, the District Judge admitted in evidence, <em>inter alia</em>, a s 16 MDA certificate signed by Ms Kuan
                    Soo Yan, an analyst employed by HSA at the material time
                    (“Ms Kuan’s s 16 MDA certificate”), as <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the matters stated therein
                        (<em>eg</em>, the type and the quantity of specified
                    drug found in Lim’s urine sample).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On appeal to the High Court, the Prosecution
                    withdrew its reliance on Ms Kuan’s s 16 MDA certificate and the
                    s 22 MDA presumption, with the result that the Prosecution had no evidence
                    against Lim on the offence charged, except for the confession given in his
                    cautioned statement recorded on 20 March 2008 under s 122(6) of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the
                    CPC”). That confession (“the s 122(6) confession”) was
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I admit to my guilt and hope for a lighter sentence. I am married with 3
                        kids and I hope that I can be given a chance. I also have aged parents whom
                        I visit often because my mother has difficulty walking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Prosecution argued that the s 122(6)
                    confession by Lim and his decision to remain silent when his defence was called
                    were, taken together, sufficient evidence to convict Lim of the offence charged.
                    The MA judge disagreed and held that those two factors were not sufficient to
                    prove beyond reasonable doubt that Lim <em>knew</em> that
                    the substance consumed by him was, in fact, norketamine, given the assertion in
                    his long statement recorded pursuant to s 121 of the CPC that he did not
                    know he had consumed norketamine as he had only “mistakenly [taken] a few
                    sips of water from a glass on the table in the Geylang premises where he was
                    arrested” (see <em>Lim Boon Keong</em> at
                    [63]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The MA judge held that there was no evidence
                    that Lim was capable of identifying norketamine as his previous convictions for
                    the offence of unauthorised drug consumption under s 8 of the MDA
                    (“the offence of drug consumption”) related to other drugs, such
                    as ketamine or nimetazepam, but not norketamine, and no evidence was led by the
                    Prosecution to show that ketamine and nimetazepam were similar to norketamine.
                    The MA judge also noted that Lim had made the s 122(6) confession to the
                    investigating officer only when he was informed by the latter that norketamine
                    had been found in his urine sample after tests done by HSA. The MA judge found
                    it “curious that [Lim had] confessed his guilt in the course of being
                    cautioned, the whole purpose of which [was] for him to state any defence he
                    might have” (see <em>Lim Boon Keong</em> at [63]).
                    Given those circumstances, the MA judge held that it would not be safe to draw,
                    based on Lim’s silence at the trial, any adverse inference as to
                    Lim’s knowledge of or familiarity with norketamine. He was also not
                    prepared to hold that Lim had sufficient knowledge of and familiarity with
                    norketamine such that the s 122(6) confession was proof beyond reasonable
                    doubt that Lim had in fact consumed norketamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     We do not propose to comment on the merits of
                    the actual decision in <em>Lim Boon Keong</em> as it is not
                    relevant to the issue in this appeal. What is relevant, instead, is the
                    appellant’s reliance on the MA judge’s observations on
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA. Before we go into
                    those observations, we set out below, for ease of reference,
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) as well as ss 16 and 22
                    of the MDA:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Both of the urine tests must be
                        conducted by the authorised persons who eventually certified the presence of
                        the drug in question in the accused’s urine sample. If the authorised
                        person did not conduct the urine tests which revealed the presence of that
                        drug, he or she could not certify its presence in the accused’s urine
                        sample.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was
                        both “necessary and sufficient for the [authorised person] to
                        supervise the testing process[, but,] … [i]t [was] strictly not
                        necessary for the [authorised person] to physically conduct the actual
                        tests” (see <em>Lim Boon Keong</em> at [39]). In
                        this regard, the authorised person could not be said to have conducted the
                        urine test in question if he or she had only reviewed the test results, as
                        opposed to actually supervising the testing process.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     Each of the urine tests prescribed by
                            s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) must be done independently
                        of the other, <em>ie</em>, the authorised person
                        testing one part of the accused’s urine sample could not be involved
                        in any way in the testing of the other part of the accused’s urine
                        sample. This requirement applied as well to the supervision and review of
                        the urine tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     If the urine tests were not conducted in compliance with
                            s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), the results of the tests
                        showing the presence of the drug in question in the accused’s urine
                        sample could not trigger the operation of the s 22 MDA presumption
                            (<em>ie</em>, the rebuttable presumption that the
                        accused had consumed that drug).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     For the purposes of the present discussion, we
                    shall assume that the MA judge’s observations on the effect of
                    non-compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) are correct.
                    (We are <em>not</em>, however, making any ruling or
                    comments on the correctness of the MA judge’s observations on
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) as that issue is currently the
                    subject of an on-going drug consumption trial in the High Court and, further,
                    was not argued in full before us.) Proceeding on the aforesaid assumption, what
                    is clear to us is that, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of
                    drug consumption specifically, <em>if
                        s 31(4)(</em>b<em>) has not been complied
                        with</em>, the Prosecution must prove <em>actual</em> consumption of the drug in question by the accused before
                    he can be convicted of the offence. How can the Prosecution prove this fact
                        (<em>ie</em>, the <em>actus
                        reus</em> of the offence of drug consumption) in such a situation? As
                    we see it, there are only two modes of proof (assuming, as just mentioned, that
                    the MA judge’s observations on the effect of non-compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) are correct) – one way
                    is by the accused admitting or confessing to the act of consumption, the other
                    is by the Prosecution calling a witness who actually saw the accused consume the
                    drug in question. In <em>Lim Boon Keong</em>, in the
                    proceedings before the MA judge, the Prosecution relied solely on the
                    s 122(6) confession made by Lim (reproduced at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above) as proof of consumption (<em>cf</em> the Prosecution’s case in the proceedings before the
                    District Judge, where Ms Kuan’s s 16 MDA certificate and the
                    s 22 MDA presumption were relied on as well (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above)), but the MA judge rejected that confession on the
                    ground of unreliability, having regard to the circumstances in which it was
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Apart from commenting on the effect of
                    non-compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) on the
                    operation of the s 22 MDA presumption (see sub-para (e) of <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above), the MA judge also considered the
                    consequences which such non-compliance would have on the operation of s 16
                    of the MDA <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of drug
                    consumption. In his view, if the tests on an accused’s urine sample were
                    not carried out in compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>), then the s 16 MDA certificate setting out the results of
                    those tests could not be relied on as presumptive proof that the drug in
                    question had been found in the accused’s urine sample. In other words, the
                    Judge was of the view that if the s 22 MDA presumption was inapplicable
                    because of non-compliance with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>),
                    then s 16 could not be invoked to circumvent such non-compliance and to, in
                    turn, trigger the operation of the s 22 MDA presumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the present case, the issue which the
                    appellant’s counsel (“Mr Masih”) raised before us was
                    not whether s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA had been
                    complied with so as to trigger the operation of the s 22 MDA presumption.
                    Rather, it was whether the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the
                    ingredients of the charge against the appellant with reference to the type and
                    the quantity of controlled drug specified in the charge. This issue was raised
                    in the light of the MA judge’s observations in <em>Lim Boon
                        Keong</em> on the implications which non-compliance with
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) would have on a s 16 MDA
                    certificate and the s 22 MDA presumption in relation to the offence of drug
                    consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant’s argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Masih rightly conceded at the outset
                    that unlike the offence of drug consumption, in respect of which the procedure
                    for testing an accused’s urine sample for the presence of a controlled or
                    specified drug was prescribed by s 31(4)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the MDA, where the offence of drug trafficking as set out in s 5 of the
                    MDA (“the offence of drug trafficking”) was concerned, there was
                    no statutorily prescribed procedure for analysing the substance found in the
                    accused’s possession which was alleged to contain a controlled drug.
                    Mr Masih framed his argument in this way: Given that the law had provided
                    such a strict regime for testing an accused’s urine sample for the
                    presence of a controlled or specified drug for the purposes of the offence of
                    drug consumption, the same regime should apply “equally if not even more
                        stringently”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> to the scientific analysis of the
                    type and the quantity of controlled drug found in an accused’s possession
                    for the purposes of the offence of drug trafficking, which was a much more
                    serious offence. Mr Masih pointed out that since a s 16 MDA
                    certificate was issued both in a drug consumption case (where the
                    accused’s urine sample would be tested for the presence of a controlled or
                    specified drug) and in a drug trafficking case (where the type and the quantity
                    of controlled drug found in the accused’s possession had to be
                    ascertained), at the very least, “the same high standard of procedures
                    laid down for … drug consumption cases should also apply for drug
                    trafficking cases”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For this reason, Mr Masih submitted, just
                    as the Prosecution had to prove due compliance with the requirements of
                        s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA for the purposes of
                    proving the presence of a controlled or specified drug in an accused’s
                    urine sample and, in turn, consumption of that drug by the accused in a drug
                    consumption case, in a drug trafficking case, the Prosecution must adduce
                    evidence that the tests conducted to determine the type and the quantity of
                    controlled drug found in the accused’s possession complied with a similar,
                    or even higher, standard of accuracy and rigour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Based on the above considerations,
                    Mr Masih argued that since, in the present case, the Prosecution had not
                    led any evidence to show that it was indeed PW5 who had conducted or at least
                    supervised the actual testing of the White Substance for the presence of the
                    controlled drug in question (<em>viz</em>, diamorphine),
                    the presumption under s 16 of the MDA could not be applied to P67–P88
                    and, consequently, the Defence had succeeded in casting reasonable doubt on the
                    Prosecution’s case with regard to the type and the quantity of controlled
                    drug found in the possession of the appellant at the time of his
                arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our analysis of the appellant’s argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There is much to be said for
                    Mr Masih’s argument from an intellectual, or even commonsensical,
                    point of view. It makes sense that if the procedure prescribed for testing an
                    accused’s urine sample for the presence of a controlled or specified drug
                    for the purposes of the offence of drug consumption is so rigorous, the same or
                    even a higher standard must apply to the procedure for analysing the type and
                    the quantity of controlled drug found in an accused’s possession for the
                    purposes of the offence of drug trafficking, which is much more serious than the
                    offence of drug consumption. The Prosecution did not deny the logical force of
                    this argument. That, in our view, would explain why, after Mr Masih raised
                    this ground of appeal, the Prosecution served on him the affidavit of PW5 dated
                    12 August 2010 (“the 12 August 2010 affidavit”) setting
                    out the scientific analysis carried out by HSA on the White Substance. It should
                    be noted that Mr Masih had no objections to the admission of this
                    affidavit, which we shall refer to in greater detail later (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>–<a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We were unable to accept Mr Masih’s
                    argument on the facts of the present case because, at the trial, the Prosecution
                        <em>did</em> lead evidence on the scientific analysis
                    of the White Substance. As mentioned at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>
                    above, in the court below, the Prosecution tendered P67–P88 as evidence of
                    the type and the quantity of controlled drug contained in the White Substance.
                    Further, PW5 testified that she had been an analyst with HSA since 1997, and had
                    been attached to the laboratories of the Drug Enforcement Agency in the United
                        States.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In her examination-in-chief,
                    PW5 said that “[her] analysis would have revealed that the purity level
                    of the diamorphine in each exhibit [referred to in P67–P88] …
                    ranged basically from 7.6 to 7.9 per cent of the gross

                        sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked
                        “A1A”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The exhibit was found to be thirty six (36) packets and one (1) paper
                        packet containing 267.0 grams of granular/powdery substance which was
                        pulverised and homogenised into a powdery substance. The powdery substance
                        was analysed and found to contain not less than 20.62 grams of
                        diamorphine, at a confidence level of 99.9999%.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Diamorphine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in The First Schedule

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As can be seen from P67 (as reproduced above),
                    the matters contained in that s 16 MDA certificate included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     the marking of the relevant exhibit
                            (<em>viz</em>,
                    “A1A”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     the constitution of the relevant exhibit (<em>viz</em>, 36 packets and one paper packet containing
                        “granular/powdery substance”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                            (<em>ie</em>, the White
                    Substance));</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        amount/weight of the substance analysed (<em>viz</em>,
                        267g); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        type and the quantity of controlled drug found in the substance analysed
                            (<em>viz</em>, 20.62g of
                    diamorphine).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It may also be noted that P67 did not state
                    that PW5 had personally conducted the various scientific tests carried out to
                    determine the type and the quantity of controlled drug contained in the
                    substance in Exhibit “A1A”, nor did it state that PW5 had
                    personally pulverised and homogenised that substance. In short, P67 was silent
                    as to <em>how</em> the substance in
                    Exhibit “A1A” was analysed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The reason for the lack of these details is
                    that s 16 of the MDA does not require such details to be set out in a
                    s 16 MDA certificate, nor does it prescribe who should carry out the
                    scientific analysis of the type and the quantity of controlled drug found in an
                    accused’s possession and how such analysis should be conducted. In other
                    words, s 16 of the MDA <em>assumes</em> that a
                    s 16 MDA certificate, when signed by an authorised person (as defined at
                    sub-para (a) of <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above), complies
                    with all the requirements of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidential value of P67–P88</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     We mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) that in the court below, the appellant
                    declined to lead any evidence to challenge the matters presumptively proved by
                    P67–P88, which were admitted in evidence against him. The appellant also
                    did not enter a defence, and his then counsel did not cross-examine PW5 on the
                    issues which were raised before this court on appeal. In the circumstances, the
                    trial judge held that the Prosecution had proved the charge against the
                    appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It bears emphasis that the appellant had the
                    opportunity, at the trial, to rebut the matters presumptively proved by
                    P67–P88 by cross-examining PW5 on the matters set out in those
                    certificates and also by ascertaining from her how the scientific analysis of
                    the White Substance had been conducted. PW5, if she had been questioned, would
                    have been able to give evidence on how the aforesaid scientific analysis was
                    conducted, the standard applied, the person(s) involved, the kind of equipment
                    used and all the other matters that defence counsel would have needed to know in
                    order to assess whether the scientific analysis of the White Substance had been
                    properly conducted. As this was not done, the trial judge was fully entitled to
                    assume, pursuant to s 16 of the MDA, that defence counsel was satisfied
                    that P67–P88 did indeed prove the matters set out therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In our view, the argument by Mr Masih
                    would have been relevant, in the context of the Prosecution having to discharge
                    the burden of proving an accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, if the
                    MDA had required the Prosecution to prove the matters contained in a s 16
                    MDA certificate. However, this is not the law as a s 16 MDA certificate,
                    when admitted in evidence, is presumptive proof of the matters which it sets out
                        <em>unless</em> the accused is able to prove the
                    contrary of those matters. To quote the words of s 16 of the MDA, a
                    s 16 MDA certificate signed by an authorised person “shall be
                    admitted in evidence” in any proceedings for an offence under the MDA,
                    and “on its production by the [P]rosecution without proof of signature
                    and, <em>until the contrary is proved</em>, shall be proof
                    of all matters contained therein” [emphasis added]. The effect of
                    s 16 is that where a s 16 MDA certificate is admitted in evidence, the
                    onus falls on the accused to prove that the matters contained in that
                    certificate (<em>eg</em>, the type and the quantity of
                    controlled drug in question) are, for whatever reasons, inaccurate and/or should
                    not be relied upon. Given that a s 16 MDA certificate is presumptive proof
                    (as opposed to conclusive proof) of all the matters stated therein, an accused
                    who takes issue with the accuracy and/or the validity of a s 16 MDA
                    certificate <em>must</em> cross-examine the authorised
                    person who signed it if he (<em>ie</em>, the accused)
                    wishes to take issue with the procedure or the circumstances surrounding the
                    preparing, signing and issuance of the certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Mr Masih also argued that this court
                    should order a retrial so that the Defence could cross-examine PW5 on her
                    testimony and P67–P88. We did not accept this argument as it was based
                    merely on an extrapolation from the observations of the MA judge in <em>Lim Boon Keong</em> on the consequences of non-compliance
                    with s 31(4)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA. Mr Masih was
                    in effect trying to indirectly challenge the validity of P67–P88 by
                    relying on the assumption that the scientific analysis of the White Substance
                    had not been properly carried out. There was no basis for this assumption. In
                    this regard, we found the 12 August 2010 affidavit
                significant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the 12 August 2010 affidavit, PW5
                    explained the equipment and the methodology used to analyse the type and the
                    quantity of controlled drug found in the White Substance. The details of the
                    tests done were set out in the 13 exhibits annexed to that affidavit. PW5
                    disclosed (among other things) that she had not conducted all the tests
                    personally, and that a laboratory officer, Ms Phua Chiu Guay Nancy
                    (“Ms Phua”), had assisted her in blending (<em>ie</em>, homogenising), using a laboratory blender, the contents of
                    each exhibit analysed as well as in carrying out certain other tasks as
                    described in the 12 August 2010 affidavit. From that affidavit, it can be
                    seen that whenever Ms Phua was instructed to assist PW5 in certain aspects
                    of the qualitative and/or quantitative tests done on the White Substance, PW5
                    inspected, supervised and cross-checked that Ms Phua carried out the
                    instructions given to her in accordance with the proper procedure and
                    protocol.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In view of our decision on the law (see
                        <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above), it is not necessary for us
                    to comment on the statements made by PW5 in the 12 August 2010 affidavit
                    concerning the accuracy of the various scientific tests carried out to determine
                    the type and the quantity of controlled drug contained in the White Substance
                        (<em>eg</em>, the preliminary colour tests, the thin
                    layer chromatography tests, the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry tests, and
                    so on). We have no basis and see no reason to disbelieve PW5’s statements.
                    However, in order to allay any concern that the scientific analysis of the White
                    Substance in the present case might not have been conducted in accordance with
                    generally accepted international standards, we should highlight the following
                    passages in the 12 August 2010 affidavit:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

                            Instruments and Minor Equipment] are based on internationally accepted
                            methodology and are validated in the laboratory before being adopted by
                            the laboratory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52.    All new officers are trained in-house and have to
                            pass competency tests before they are allowed to carry out casework. The
                            analysts and laboratory officers undergo annual proficiency testing
                            (including external international proficiency tests for the analysts) in
                            their respective job scopes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53.    The laboratory has been accredited by the American
                            Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board
                            (ASCLD/LAB) since 1996. Each accreditation is valid for five years and
                            the next accreditation is due in 2011. In between external accreditation
                            inspections, the laboratory is subject to annual internal audits, the
                            results of which are reported to the Senior Management of HSA as well as
                            ASCLD/LAB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54.    The laboratory participates in a number of
                            external international proficiency tests provided by the United Nations
                            Office on Drugs and Crime (International Collaborative Exercises),
                            National Measurement Institute of Australia (interlaboratory proficiency
                            tests) and the Collaborative Testing Services, USA. The laboratory has
                            passed all external international proficiency tests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55.    Following the Laboratory Manual, solvent checks

                            is to ensure that all solvents used in the laboratory are clean and do
                            not contain any illicit drugs, which would be detected by the instrument
                            when the solvent is run during the testing process.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Of course, the adoption by HSA of
                    “internationally accepted methodology”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> does not mean that, in every case,
                    each of the tests conducted by HSA will meet the aforesaid international
                    standards. Whether or not those international standards have been met is
                    essentially a question of fact (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Ang
                        Soon Huat</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 246 (“<em>Ang Soon Huat</em>”), where the High Court held, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of drug trafficking as set out in
                    s 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed), that the
                    tests devised and conducted in that case did not meet the requirements of the
                    criminal standard of proof).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the present case, no challenge was mounted
                    against P67–P88 at the trial (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                    and <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above). In our view, having regard to the 12 August
                    2010 affidavit, we did not think that ordering a retrial so as to allow the
                    Defence to cross-examine PW5 on the matters set out in that affidavit was likely
                    to rebut the matters presumptively proved by P67–P88. There was one other
                    material consideration in the present case which made a successful rebuttal
                    highly improbable, namely: the appellant had confessed that he had indeed
                    trafficked in <em>64.34g</em> of diamorphine as charged.
                    That quantity of diamorphine exceeded by more than four times the statutory
                    threshold set for the imposition of the death sentence <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of trafficking in diamorphine, namely,
                    trafficking in any quantity of diamorphine of more than 15g (see the Second
                    Schedule to the MDA; <em>cf Ang Soon Huat</em>, where the
                    difference between the statutory threshold and the amount of diamorphine
                    trafficked as alleged by the Prosecution (which amount was eventually held by
                    the court not to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt) was only in the
                    region of 3.61g to 3.77g).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the light of the foregoing, we dismissed
                    the appeal as there was nothing which suggested that the appellant’s
