<strong>Judgment</strong>

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<b xmlns=""><font face="Univers (W1),Arial">
<p align="justify"></p></font>Background</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. The plaintiffs in this originating summons, Bermuda Trust

(Singapore) Ltd (‘the Trustees’) were the trustees of a ‘Sinchew’

trust set up by cl 9 of the will of Wee Kay Siang, deceased. Anthony Wee Soon Kim, the

fifth defendant (‘Mr Wee’), is a grandson of Wee Kay Siang, deceased.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. By a judgment dated 26 November 1998, I held that the Sinchew trust

had failed as it had by then become impossible and/or impracticable to perform the objects

of the trust. Subsequently by an order of court dated 30 July 1999, I made the following

orders:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘1. The Sinchew House and the capital and income held by the

  Plaintiffs pursuant to Clauses 9 and 10 of the Will in relation to the Sinchew Trust are

  held on Trust for Anthony Wee Soon Kim, being the eldest male person who is alive on the

  date that the Court declared the Trust under Clause 9 had failed and who is on that day

  nearest in the direct line descent to Wee Kah Kiat;</p>
<p align="justify">….</p>
<p align="justify">4. The Plaintiffs’ remuneration for their services as trustees be

  revised to allow the Plaintiffs to charge their current fees as opposed to the

  Plaintiffs’ scale fees contained in the Plaintiffs’ booklet published in 1953

  with effect from the 25<sup>th </sup>day of August 1997.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The costs of these proceedings in respect of all parties except the

  3<sup>rd</sup> Defendant to be taxed on an indemnity basis and be paid out of the trust

  fund;</p>
<p align="justify">6. There be liberty to apply.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. On 25 October 2001, Mr Wee took out a summons in chambers asking for

various reliefs. I heard the parties and made certain orders in November 2001. Mr Wee is

dissatisfied with the whole of my decision.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The application and my decision</p></b><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) The Trustees’ costs</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The first order applied for by Mr Wee was a declaration that the

Trustees were only entitled to charge an administrative fee for work done for the period 1

January 1998 to 30 July 1999 (date of the order of court) amounting to $2,399.07 (ie

$1,515.21 for 1998 plus $883.85 pro-rated for the period from 1 January 1999 to 30 July

1999). The essence of this prayer was that Mr Wee did not accept the manner in which the

Trustees had calculated the fees due to themselves and asserted that if these were

correctly calculated the amount due would total only $2,399.07.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. On 30 July 1999, I had made an express order allowing the Trustees

to be remunerated for their work in accordance with their then current standard scale of

charges. This remuneration order was made retrospective to 25 August 1997. The

Trustees’ then standard scale of charges had come into operation on 1 January 1994

and it provided that the Trustees were entitled to be paid an administration fee of one

percent of the gross value of the assets under administration.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. The Trustees had furnished their Revised Tax Invoices to Mr

Wee’s solicitors in October 2001. By these invoices the Trustees charged

administrative and investment fees of $42,964.78 for the year 1998 and $28,391.10 for the

first six months of 1999 on the basis that these sums were equivalent to one percent (1%)

of the gross value of the trust fund. The bulk of the charges arose from the

Trustees’ valuation of the property no. 16 Mohamed Sultan Road (‘the

property’) as being worth $3 million.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. Mr Wee objected to the charges. His grounds were as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) the property was impressed with the Sinchew trust until 30 July

  1999. It was in a dilapidated state and had not been maintained by the Trustees;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the property had not generated income for a long time because it

  was impressed with the trust and therefore the Trustees’ assertion that the open

  market value of the property was $3 million based on a valuation done in May 1997 could

  not be correct as no prudent purchaser would be prepared to pay $3 million for a

  dilapidated rent controlled property impressed with a Sinchew trust;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) the trust accounts furnished by the Trustees for the period from

  July 1957 to 31 December 1999 showed that the capital value of the property was only

  $16,000. The Trustees had taken the value of the property to be $3 million so as to

  inflate the value of the trust and produce tax invoices on the inflated value;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) the Trustees’ Balance Sheet and Capital Account for the year

  ended 1998 showed the administrative, discretionary and investment fees to total only

  $1,515.21 yet by the year ended 1999 the fees had escalated to the astronomical figure of

  $51,945.99. At best, the Trustees were entitled $1,515.21 as their fees for 1998 and a sum

  of $883.85 (pro-rated for seven months) for the period 1 January 1999 to 30 July 1999.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. The Trustees’ stand was that they were entitled to calculate

their charges on the basis that the gross value of the property was $3 million in 1998 and

the first half of 1999. They relied on a valuation report dated 19 May 1997 issued by

Chesterton International Property Consultants Pte Ltd. In this report, the valuers had

opined that the open market value of the property, with vacant possession and free from

encumbrances, was $3 million and that the open market value of the property, subject to a

rent controlled tenancy at a rental of $49.40 per month, was $2.9 million. It should be

noted that at the material times, the property was vacant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The Trustees also clarified why their fees had been shown as

$1,515.21 in their Balance Sheet and Capital Account for the year 1998 and had apparently

escalated to an astronomical fee of $51,945.99 in mid June 1999. The reason that there was

an increase in the administrative fee in 1999 was due to an accounting entry. In December

1998, the administrative fee for the year 1998 had yet to accrue as the Trustees were

waiting for the decision of the High Court in respect of the fees payable for

administration of the Sinchew trust before charging these fees. It was only after that

decision was given and the Trustees were entitled to charge, with retrospective effect, a

fee of one percent of the gross assets, that the fees were correctly assessed and then

included in the June 1999 accounts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. I accepted the Trustees’ argument that they were entitled to

value the property at $3 million as this was the open market value given to it by a

reputable valuer. The fact that the property was dilapidated had already been taken into

account in the valuation which described the general state of repair of the property to be

poor as at the time of the inspection by the valuers in 1997. Further, the fact that the

property was subject to the Sinchew trust was irrelevant to the valuation as the valuers

were asked to value the property on an open market basis. The Trustees’ standard

scale of charges allowed them to charge on the basis of ‘gross value of assets under

administration’. Although the term ‘gross value’ was not defined in the

scale, I considered that it should be given its ordinary meaning and that in this context,

the Trustees were entitled to equate gross value with open market value on an unencumbered

basis. If encumbrances were to be taken into account, the value given would be a net value

rather than a gross value. On this basis, it was my opinion that Mr Wee had no ground to

assert that the proper fee for the period from 1 January 1998 to 30 July 1999 was

$2,399.07. Accordingly, I made no order on his first prayer.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><br/>

(ii) Payment of interest to Mr Wee</i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. Mr Wee’s second prayer was for the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘that the Plaintiffs as trustees of the Will of the Testator be

  ordered :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) to pay the balance of such capital and income standing to the

    credit of the estate (after deduction of their fees amounting to $2,399-07) to the

    solicitors for the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant forthwith which is only to be released to the

    5<sup>th</sup> Defendant after payment of the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ taxed

    costs.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) to pay interest on such capital sum and income to the solicitors

    for the 5<sup>th</sup> Defendant at 6% per annum</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) on the total sum standing to the credit of the 5<sup>th</sup>

      Defendant for the period 30<sup>th</sup> July 1999 to 21<sup>st</sup> September 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) on the balance (after deduction of $400,000 paid to the 5<sup>th</sup>

      Defendant on 21<sup>st</sup> September 2001) for the period 22<sup>nd</sup> September 2001

      to the date of payment.’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Mr Wee asserted that once it was clear from the order of court of

30 July 1999 that the capital and income held by the Trustees were held on trust for him,

the Trustees had two options. They could have:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) released the monies due to him to his solicitors immediately after

  the date of the court order subject to the retention of a reasonable sum to meet their

  invoices and their solicitors’ taxed costs in relation to the originating summons; or</p>
<p align="justify">(b) released the monies due to him to his solicitors immediately after

  the date of the court order subject to his solicitors’ undertaking to retain a

  reasonable sum to meet their invoices and their solicitors’ taxed costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. The Trustees did not pursue either option. Mr Wee stated that he

had been deprived of the use of the trust funds for more than two years. The Trustees only

released part of the trust funds ($400,000) to him on 21 September 2001. He asserted that

the Trustees as professional trustees were obliged to account to him for the interest lost

on the trust funds between the date of the court order and payment of part of the trust

funds to him as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) on the total sum standing to his credit for the period 30 July 1999

  to 21 September 2001; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) on the balance (after deduction of $400,000) for the period 22

  September 2001 to the date of payment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. In response the Trustees referred to the order of court made on 18

April 2000 whereby I had ordered them to pay the capital and income of the trust to Mr Wee

after deduction of their remuneration upon being furnished the necessary account details

by Mr Wee. They had then proceeded to tax the legal costs of the solicitors for the other

defendants in the main action (as these costs were payable by the fund) and when this was

complete had tried to release funds to Mr Wee. They had not been successful because Mr Wee

had not given them the necessary account details.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. The Trustees referred to a letter dated 24 August 2000 to Mr

Wee’s solicitors from their solicitors whereby they had enquired when Mr Wee expected

the Trustees to hand over to him the assets and files in respect of the trust. There was

no reply to this letter. By a subsequent letter dated 7 September 2000, the Trustees’

solicitors asked for Mr Wee’s instructions as to how he proposed the assets should be

transferred. There was no reply to this enquiry either. On 30 November 2000, the Trustees

were informed by their solicitors that Mr Wee’s solicitors had no instructions to

accept payment of funds on Mr Wee’s behalf.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. I considered that as far as those assets of the trust which were

held in cash were concerned, the Trustees did not need account details in order to make

payment to Mr Wee. They could easily have sent him a draft for the amount due via his

solicitors. The only uncertainty was the amount payable since the Trustees’

solicitors’ bill for the main action had not been finalised. The estimated amount of

this payable could, however, have been deducted and the balance paid out to Mr Wee as

indeed was done in September 2001. By the time of the hearing, however, the taxation of

this bill was imminent. It was, therefore, pointless to make another payment less

retention of the estimated amount of the bill. Accordingly, I made an order that the

Trustees should pay the balance of the capital and income to the solicitors for Mr Wee

forthwith upon conclusion of the taxation of that bill.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. I was informed by the Trustees’ solicitors that as at 30 July

1999, the Trustees had held cash in the amount of $775,516.40 on trust for Mr Wee. As of

the date of the hearing, the Trustees’ bill totalled $128,495.84 and the

solicitors’ bill for taxation came up to $113,000. Thus the expenses to be deducted

from the cash amounted to $241,495.84 and the balance payable to Mr Wee as at that date

was approximately $534,020.56. Out of this $400,000 had already been sent to Mr Wee.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. Since it was my view that the Trustees should have paid whatever

could reasonably be estimated to be due to Mr Wee on 18 April 2000 forthwith upon the

making of the court order and that they had no reasonable excuse for delaying this

payment, I agreed with Mr Wee’s counsel that interest would have to be paid in

relation to the delay. The question was what was the correct amount of interest. Mr Wee in

his application had asked for six percent per annum. That seemed to me to be unduly high

bearing in mind current low interest-rate levels for savings and fixed deposit accounts.

Further, the Trustees would have earned only a one percent fee on the value of the assets

(though of course they were not entitled to charge that fee in respect of assets that

should have been paid over since the assets were no longer theirs to be managed) and they

had acted in good faith, albeit in a rather lackadaisical fashion in that they had waited

to be told what to do rather than taken the initiative. In view of these circumstances, I

considered that it would be sufficient to order them to pay interest calculated at the

rate of one half of one percent on the amount that should have been paid earlier. I

therefore made the following orders:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) the plaintiffs [the Trustees] shall pay the fifth defendant [Mr

  Wee] interest of half percent per annum on the following sums:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the sum of $400,000 from 18 April 2000 to 21 September 2001; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the sum of $134,000 from 18 April 2000 up to the date of payment of

    the principal sum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2) the above interest payments have been calculated on the basis that

  the plaintiffs’ bills as presented are correct and in accordance with their scale

  fees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">19. The final issue was one of costs. Each party had succeeded on one issue and failed

on another. I therefore ordered that each party should bear its/his own costs and that for

the avoidance of doubt the plaintiffs/Trustees should not deduct their costs in relation

to the application from the estate.</p>
