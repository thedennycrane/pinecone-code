        The Plaintiff Swiss Singapore Overseas

Enterprises Pte Ltd (‘Swiss Singapore’) applied for a mandatory injunction to

compel the Defendant Navalmar U.K. Ltd (‘Navalmar’) whether by itself or its

agents in Singapore SSC Shipping Agencies Pte Ltd (‘SSC Shipping’) to issue

eight bills of lading, the drafts of which were attached to Schedule 1 of the application,

in exchange for nine existing bills of lading issued by SSC Shipping for and on behalf of

the Master of the vessel MV Zurbaran (‘the Vessel’). The primary difference was

that the words ‘Freight To Collect’ were marked on the existing bills whereas

the new bills were to have the words ‘Freight Prepaid’. There were also other

differences which I shall elaborate on later. After hearing arguments, I granted the

mandatory injunction, although not exactly on the terms sought by Swiss Singapore.

Navalmar has appealed to the Court of Appeal against my decision.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><b><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background</font></i></b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.        

Swiss Singapore claims that by a contract dated 9 May 2002, it had purchased a cargo of

10,000 metric tonne of Indonesian Merbau Timber from UD Menara Mas of Indonesia

(‘UDMM’) for a total value of US$1.35 million. On or about 13 August 2002, UDMM

entered into a fixture note with Navalmar for the hire of the Vessel to carry the cargo

from Sorong, Indonesia to Chennai, India. Swiss Singapore is not a party to the fixture

note but the material terms thereof state:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘100% freight to be remitted

    by telegraphic transfer by Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pte Ltd, Singapore for and

</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.        

1,252 pieces of the cargo was loaded at Sorong between 3 September 2002 and 4 October 2002

and the nine bills of lading with the words ‘Freight To Collect’ were issued by

SSC Shipping for and on behalf of the Master of the Vessel.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.        On

16 October 2002, Mary Vijay of Swiss Singapore sent an e-mail to Captain Priya of Navalmar

stating:</font>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.        An

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.        On

the very same day, Swiss Singapore arranged for payment of the freight of about US$258,000

and Mary Vijay sent an e-mail to Capt Priya to forward the telex confirmation of payment

and eight drafts of bills of lading with an urgent request that Navalmar instruct SSC

Shipping to sign and release the new bills.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.        

Eight days later, on 29 October 2002, Swiss Singapore’s solicitors, Haridass Ho &amp;

Partners (‘Haridass’) sent an urgent chaser by fax to Navalmar to point out that

Navalmar had confirmed in its e-mail dated 21 October 2002 that the bills of lading would

be switched upon receipt of remittance for the freight and notwithstanding such

remittance, Navalmar had refused to instruct SSC Shipping to issue the new bills. They

also pointed out that without the new bills, Swiss Singapore would not be able to

negotiate the letter of credit issued in their favour by their Indian buyers and their

Indian buyers could not arrange customs and other clearance. The penultimate paragraph of

the fax put Navalmar on notice that if it failed to instruct SSC Shipping to issue the new

bills by close of office the next day, they would proceed to the courts in Singapore to

compel Navalmar by injunction to instruct its Singapore agents (i.e SSC Shipping) to issue

the new bills.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.        In

response, English solicitors Michael Lloyd &amp; Co (‘Michael Lloyd’), acting

for Navalmar, sent a fax reply dated 29 October 2002 asserting that Navalmar was dismayed

at the apparent indifference to an enormous demurrage debt incurred at the load port and

asking what assurance Swiss Singapore could give concerning payment thereof. The demurrage

and related costs was US$187,930. They also sought particulars of the contract between

Navalmar and Swiss Singapore and the contract term regarding the issue of the new bills.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.        

Haridass responded in a fax dated 30 October 2002 pointing out the material terms of the

fixture note and Navalmar’s e-mail dated 21 October 2002 wherein it had confirmed

that the bills of lading would be switched ‘upon receipt of frt remittance

advice’ and stressing that Swiss Singapore had paid freight. Haridass warned that if

the new bills were not issued, Swiss Singapore would be left with no alternative but to

seek the remedy stated in their earlier fax and asked Michael Lloyd to revert by the

opening of Haridass’ office the next day.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.        

Michael Lloyd then sent a reply fax dated 30 October 2002, stating that Swiss Singapore

was not a party to the fixture note and could not seek reliance on it. They also said that

‘It would appear inequitable in any event for them to take advantage of part of the

document whilst ignoring other obligations of the shipper set out in it’. Mr Lloyd

also asked to speak to Mr Haridass but no evidence was given as to whether Mr Lloyd

managed to speak to Mr Haridass and what was said in the conversation.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The application for a mandatory

injunction</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.        On

Friday 1 November 2002, Swiss Singapore commenced an action in Singapore and filed an ex

parte application for the mandatory injunction which I have mentioned. As the application

was for a mandatory injunction, I directed its Counsel, Mr R Srivathsan, to forward a copy

of the Writ of Summons, the application and the supporting affidavit to Michael Lloyd and

to SSC Shipping with a cover fax or letter stating that the application had been adjourned

to 10.30 am of 5 November 2002 (as Monday 4 November 2002 was a public holiday in

Singapore). The Vessel was expected to reach Chennai on 5 November 2002.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Arguments</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.        On

Tuesday 5 November 2002, Mr Joseph Tan appeared for Navalmar before me. He sought an

adjournment to the following Monday i.e 11 November 2002 to file an affidavit in response

although he had received instructions the previous Saturday afternoon and he had spoken to

London solicitors on Sunday and Monday. He was instructed that Navalmar’s e-mail had

been sent under pressure otherwise Swiss Singapore would not pay the freight. He was also

instructed that the export of logs from Indonesia was illegal under Indonesian law.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.        Mr

Srivathsan objected to any adjournment and took me through the e-mail dated 18 October

2002, and the two e-mail dated 21 October 2002 which I have cited in paras 6 to 8 above.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.        Mr

Tan did not dispute that freight had been received by Navalmar or that the Vessel was

likely to reach Chennai on 5 November 2002. He said he had nothing to add in respect of

the application for an adjournment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.        I

then decided to grant an order in terms of the first prayer of the application whereupon

Mr Tan produced a draft affidavit of his which he said he would affirm in the afternoon

(which was subsequently extended to 12 pm of the next day). On that basis, I allowed Mr

Tan to address me on the merits of the application. Mr Tan raised a number of arguments

and I will deal only with the more substantive ones.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.        Mr

Tan’s first argument was that Swiss Singapore was not a party to the fixture note.

The fixture note was governed by English law although it provided for arbitration in

Singapore. In so far as Swiss Singapore appeared to rely on the English Contract (Rights

of Third Parties) Act 1999 (‘the Act’), which gives rights to third parties, he

pointed out that Swiss Singapore had not adduced evidence of English law, such law being a

question of fact. On the other hand, Navalmar had obtained a written opinion from an

English Counsel Mr Michael Nolan dated 4 November 2002 to the effect that the Act did not

give Swiss Singapore the right to enforce the term in the fixture note under which

Navalmar agreed to issue a second set of bills of lading against a letter of indemnity. I

would add that the letter of indemnity was never raised as an issue previously or by Mr

Tan and I need say no more on it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.        

Secondly, the intended new bills contained different information which Navalmar objected

to. The objections were stated in a fax dated 1 November 2002 from Michael Lloyd to

Haridass i.e (i) there were eight instead of nine bills, (ii) more importantly, the new

bills would acknowledge shipment of a total of 6,301 cbm logs whereas the original bills

referred to 6,171 cbm, (iii) the new bills would be dated 29 September 2002 whereas the

originals had various dates between 3 September 2002 and 4 October 2002.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.        

Thirdly, if the contract of sale was illegal then Swiss Singapore should not be granted

equitable relief against Navalmar as Swiss Singapore had come to court with unclean hands.

Mr Tan said that the cargo could be discharged in Chennai and kept in a godown while the

issue of demurrage is sorted out.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.        

Fourthly, Mr Tan submitted that the entire transaction was suspicious. In the past,

Navalmar had dealt only with Swiss Singapore. For the present cargo, Swiss Singapore had

asked Navalmar to charter the Vessel but prior to the conclusion of the charter, Swiss

Singapore said that they would prefer it if Navalmar dealt with UDMM for this particular

transaction. Navalmar had never dealt with UDMM before and had entered into the

charterparty with UDMM solely at Swiss Singapore’s request. Accordingly, Swiss

Singapore might be liable for demurrage as undisclosed principal.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.        Mr

Srivathsan did not dispute that Swiss Singapore was not a party to the fixture note. Swiss

Singapore was relying on the Act to give it rights against Navalmar. He took me through

section 1 of the Act. He also submitted that Swiss Singapore would also rely on the e-mail

as constituting a separate contract as between Navalmar and Swiss Singapore and/or

estoppel.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.        As

for the different information to be contained in the new bills, they were the requirements

of Swiss Singapore’s purchasers.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.        As

for illegality, he submitted that Swiss Singapore was the buyer FOB. It was not its

concern whether the seller has the requisite licence to sell or export the cargo.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.        As

for the allegation that Swiss Singapore was the undisclosed principal, he denied this on

the basis that it had bought the cargo from UDMM.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.        It

is true that Swiss Singapore did not tender any opinion from any English solicitor or

counsel on the Act but there was evidence from Mr Nolan as to what section 1 and 6 states,

in addition to his opinion thereon. However, Mr Nolan’s opinion was significantly

silent about the exchange of e-mail.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.        It

seemed to me that Swiss Singapore had a strong case that Navalmar was estopped from

denying that Swiss Singapore had an enforceable right against it under the fixture note in

respect of the issuance of new bills or that there was a separate contract between Swiss

Singapore and Navalmar arising from the exchange of the e-mail regarding the issuance of

the new bills when freight was paid by Swiss Singapore.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.        On

the latter point, Mr Tan submitted (in his request for further arguments which I declined

to accede to) that the consideration from Swiss Singapore was done for and on behalf of

UDMM and as agent for UDMM. Thus, there was no consideration from Swiss Singapore.

However, there was no evidence that Swiss Singapore had paid the freight on behalf of UDMM

or as its agent. He also submitted that the payment of freight was past consideration but,

as Swiss Singapore was not a party to the fixture note, it was, prima facie, not obliged

to pay the freight in the first place.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.        As

regards the second argument on the three discrepancies between the drafts of the new bills

and the originals, I was of the view that this could be overcome by an appropriate order

addressing the objections.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.        As

regards the third argument about illegality, there was no evidence from an Indonesian

lawyer about the illegality let alone Swiss Singapore’s complicity in it. Mr Tan had

relied solely on what Capt Priya had told him, and Capt Priya had in turn relied on what

Navalmar’s Indonesia agents had said. Even then, Mr Tan could only say that the whole

transaction ‘may be’ illegal. In any event, the cargo was already no longer in

the territory of Indonesia and the present dispute was not between buyer and seller. It

seemed to me that Navalmar was not at all concerned about the alleged illegality. It had

not offered to return the freight paid or to carry the cargo back to Indonesia. On the

contrary, it was quite prepared to deliver the cargo to Swiss Singapore or its buyers if

demurrage was paid. It was clear to me that the allegation about illegality was just an

excuse raised in an attempt to deny Swiss Singapore the relief it had sought.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.        As

regards the fourth argument about Swiss Singapore being the undisclosed principal behind

the fixture note, Navalmar could still pursue this position even if the mandatory

injunction was granted. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.        I

was mindful that a court should be slow in granting a mandatory injunction especially if

it is the substantive relief sought in the action. However, I was of the view that the

justice of the case was clearly in favour of Swiss Singapore, at least in respect of its

present application.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.        It

is not in dispute that Navalmar was aware that demurrage was outstanding when its two

e-mail dated 18 and 21 October 2002 were sent. It could have remained silent when Swiss

Singapore had sought its confirmation that the new bills would be issued upon payment of

the freight or it could have informed Swiss Singapore quite openly that the new bills

would not be issued unless both the freight and demurrage were paid. It did not elect

either of these options. Instead, it gave not one but two confirmations that it would

switch the bills when the freight was paid. The first confirmation was implied in its

e-mail dated 18 October 2002 and the second was specific in its e-mail dated 21 October

2002. Indeed in its second confirmation, it went so far as to say that the delay in the

switch was due to non payment of freight and that this could have been done ‘10 days

ago’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37.        

Navalmar knew that Swiss Singapore did not want any dispute about the new bills (see again

Swiss Singapore’s e-mail dated 21 October 2002 cited in para 7 above). Yet either it

deliberately deceived Swiss Singapore into believing that the bills would be switched upon

payment of the freight or it resiled from its position after receiving such payment. Even

after Navalmar had received evidence of the payment of freight, it did not promptly raise

the issue of outstanding demurrage with Swiss Singapore as a condition before releasing

the new bills for eight or more days until Haridass sent its chaser dated 29 October 2002,

as I have mentioned.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.        It

is all very well for Navalmar to take the position that the cargo can be discharged at

Chennai and kept at a godown while the issue of demurrage is sorted out. It must be aware

that this situation would give it the upper hand with a view to causing Swiss Singapore to

capitulate to its demurrage claim. Having received about US$258,000 as freight, Navalmar

has, unfortunately, resiled on its word just to obtain payment of approximately

US$188,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.        In

the circumstances, I had a ‘high degree of assurance’, to use the words of

Megarry J in <i>Shepherd Homes Ltd v Sandham</i> [1971] Ch 340, that I should grant a

mandatory injunction. Accordingly, I maintained the thrust of the injunction order I had

granted but varied it to take into account the three discrepancies raised by Navalmar.</font></p>
