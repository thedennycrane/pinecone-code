The liability phase of the arbitration ran from 10 November 2014 to 14 February 2018, and two awards were issued on this regard.  The first of these two awards, Partial Award 1, was dated 11 October 2017.  It set out the tribunal’s findings on liability.  In essence, the arbitrator found that the Contract had been validly terminated by Asplenium.

The tribunal issued Partial Award 3 on 9 April 2019.  Corrections to Partial Award 3 followed on 26 April 2019 and 15 May 2019.  In Partial Award 3, the tribunal found that CKR was liable to Asplenium for sums due and liquidated damages arising from Asplenium’s valid termination of the Contract.  However, in view of the amount already received by Asplenium pursuant to its call on the performance bond, the tribunal found that the net balance owing from Asplenium to CKR was S$6,405,536.34 (the “Award Sum”).  This net balance reflected that Asplenium had been “over-paid” pursuant to the call on the performance bond, and the over-payment was therefore had to be repaid to CKR.

The tribunal’s reasoning in the Quantum Costs Award was largely premised on the fact that Asplenium had issued a Calderbank letter on 6 August 2018 before the hearing of the quantum phase (the “Calderbank Offer”) which went unaccepted, and the fact that CKR had not achieved a more favourable outcome than what was offered in the Calderbank Offer.

The crux of the decision, for present purposes, is that where a party receives a written offer to settle proceedings for a particular sum but refuses the offer, contests proceedings, and obtains a judgment for <span class="font-italic">less than</span> that particular sum, an adverse costs order may be made against him.  The later English decision of <span class="font-italic">Cutts v Head</span> [1984] Ch 290 accepted from 302 to 312 that where a party had made a written offer to settle “without prejudice save as to costs”, that offer could be validly considered by the Court in determining the final costs order.  A useful summary of these developments is set out by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Ong Pte Ltd v Fairview Developments Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1285 from [32] to [35], but it suffices to note for present purposes that the Calderbank letter is an accepted part of Singapore law: <span class="font-italic">Shi Fang v Koh Pee Huat</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 906 at [54] to [55].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Under the terms of the Calderbank Offer, Asplenium had offered to pay CKR S$9.5 million in full and final settlement of “any and all claims, counterclaims, disputes, controversies and/or costs arising out of or in connection with the [Project], including, but not limited to the arbitration proceedings between [CKR and Asplenium]”.

Spanning a period of around five years, the bifurcated arbitration involved four Partial Awards, many days of hearing, and multiple rounds of submissions before the arbitrator.  Apart from this present application, there also have been three earlier applications to the Court for leave to appeal against questions of law arising from the tribunal’s awards.  The complexity of the matter undoubtedly engendered considerable costs on both sides.  CKR’s failure to even <span class="font-italic">respond</span> to the Calderbank Offer perhaps regrettably extinguished an opportunity to resolve the dispute before costs continued to escalate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law on granting leave under the Arbitration Act to appeal questions of law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Section 49 of the AA governs appeals against an arbitral award.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Neither of these arguments is persuasive.  The reading of the phrase referred to in [29(a)] above is strained and taken out of context.  CKR’s interpretation is wholly inconsistent with the quote in italics above at [28], which appears at the very next line.  Reading the entire paragraph as a whole, it appears far more likely to me that the tribunal was simply suggesting that the<span class="font-italic"> typical</span> outcome that would arise if a party rejected a Calderbank Offer but failed to achieve a better result is that the party would suffer costs consequences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Further, CKR’s attempt to reconcile the inconsistency referred to at [29(b)] is also, to my mind, rather implausible.  There is nothing to suggest that the tribunal believed that its discretion was limited solely to <span class="font-italic">either </span>awarding costs on an indemnity basis or awarding a higher proportion of costs.  Crucially, adopting the interpretation CKR advances would require me to insert the word “either” into the last sentence of the quote such that it read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“In such a situation a tribunal may, in an appropriate situation, <span class="font-italic">either</span> award to Party A costs on an indemnity basis or a higher proportion of costs.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Absent the term “either”, CKR’s binary reading that the tribunal believed that it could either order<span class="font-italic"> </span>indemnity costs or a higher proportion of costs is not one that is borne out by a plain reading of that sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I see no reason why the word “either” should be “read in” given the absence of any clear indication to suggest that this is what the tribunal intended to convey.  Even if that word were inserted to suggest a binary choice between imposing indemnity costs or a higher proportion of costs, that does not explain the reference to “an appropriate situation” given that the latter phrase suggests that there may be <span class="font-italic">inappropriate</span> situations where <span class="font-italic">neither</span> awarding costs on an indemnity basis nor at a higher proportion is warranted.  I am thus of the view that [36] of the Quantum Costs Award, read in its totality, makes clear that the tribunal was well aware of the discretion it had.  I am unconvinced by CKR’s attempts to suggest that the discretion the tribunal was referring to was constrained only to the appropriate <span class="font-italic">type </span>of sanction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The second reason I cannot accept CKR’s argument that the tribunal was misled is because the area of law on cost consequences following an unaccepted Calderbank offer is fairly trite and I would expect the arbitrator to have been aware of the relevant principles.  In fact, this explains the tribunal’s clear statement that the principles are “well settled” and “not in dispute” at [36] of the Quantum Costs Award.  This is also consistent with the arbitrator’s express recognition in that same paragraph of the discretion he possessed.

However, leaving all that aside, the crucial question is whether a “question of law” within the meaning of s 49(1) of the AA arises from the award.  In <span class="font-italic">Healthcare Supply Chain (Pte) Ltd v Roche Diagnostics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 3 SLR 476 (“<span class="font-italic">Healthcare Supply Chain</span>”), the High Court, despite finding that the majority arbitrators had erroneously applied the law on parol evidence, held at [8] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In so far as [the applicant’s] application was based on what it considered to be a misreading of the contract as a result of applying [the law on parol evidence erroneously], that was not an error of law but an error <span class="font-italic">in the application of the law</span>, which was <span class="font-italic">not</span> subject to appeal under s 49 [of the AA].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 On the present facts, it was accepted by both parties and the arbitrator that the law in relation to costs following an unaccepted Calderbank offer is fairly well established.  No novel points of law or particular nuances of argument in relation to the law arose in the submissions on this point.  The Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator </span><span class="font-italic">Manufacturing Sdn Bhd v United Engineers (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 494 (“<span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator</span>”) is instructive in this regard.  At [19] of <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator</span>, the Court of Appeal held that a question of law within the meaning of the AA referred to a finding of law which the parties have disputed and that requires the guidance of the court to resolve.  In this case, I do not find that the parties had disputed the relevant law in relation to the tribunal’s discretion to make adverse costs orders following a Calderbank offer.  What was in dispute was <span class="font-italic">whether</span> and <span class="font-italic">how</span> the tribunal should exercise the said discretion.  Accordingly, no question of law arises even taking CKR’s case at its highest on this Question 1, and it is only an error in the <span class="font-italic">application</span> of the law which is disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The distinction between an error in the application of the law (which does <span class="font-italic">not </span>confer a right of appeal under the AA) and a question of law (which does confer a right of appeal under the AA) reflects longstanding authority.  In <span class="font-italic">Ahong Construction (S) Pte Ltd v United Boulevard Pte Ltd</span> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 208 (“<span class="font-italic">Ahong Construction</span>”), GP Selvam JC, as he then was, defined a question of law at [7] as “a point of law in controversy which has to be resolved after opposing views and arguments have been considered”.

I accept that the law on the discretion of a tribunal to award adverse costs following an unaccepted Calderbank offer is well established and not controversial.  At the very highest, CKR can only show that there was an error in the application of the law and not a question of law.

At the risk of repetition, <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator</span> at [19] expressly states that a question of law “must necessarily be a finding of law which the parties dispute”.  If the law is settled and not disputed by the parties, then <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator</span> makes clear it is not an appealable question of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Second, CKR’s reliance on [43] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San </span>somewhat misses the point.  At that passage in the judgment, Judith Prakash J, as she then was, was dealing with the issue of whether <span class="font-italic">Northern Elevator</span> obliges the Court to limit the meaning of a “question of law” to the precise issues which were pleaded before an arbitrator.  The thrust of [43] of <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San</span> thus concerns whether an issue not having been expressly pleaded would <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> preclude it being a question of law within the meaning of s 49(1) of the AA, and <span class="font-italic">not</span> whether a question of law needs to be unsettled to fall within that statutory provision.

However, two further points can be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 First, I am not satisfied that the determination of Question 1 will substantially affect the rights of one or more of the parties.

</div>  This is a rather fanciful argument because it assumes that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the tribunal did not believe that it had any discretion in making an adverse award on costs against CKR in the first place; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the tribunal believed it had such a discretion, it would have declined to make any adverse award on costs against CKR.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Neither of these assumptions is well-founded.  As I have already explained, the tribunal does not appear to have believed that it lacked discretion to award costs against CKR: [27] to [34] above.  Further, while CKR drew the Court’s attention to a number of factors which might have militated against the awarding of costs adverse to it arising from the Calderbank Offer, I am not persuaded that those factors would have caused the tribunal to have come to a different view of the Calderbank Offer.  This is because of the substantial differential between the Calderbank Offer of S$9.5 million, and the Award Sum in favour of CKR of around S$6.4 million, coupled with the arbitrator’s finding that Suit 1274 and CA 179 would not overturn that differential even if they were both decided in CKR’s favour.  To my mind, therefore, I am not at all satisfied that determining Question 1 would substantially affect the rights of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Second, I am not satisfied that Question 1 is a question which the arbitral tribunal was asked to determine.  This, of course, is closely connected to my analysis above (see [35] to [46]) as to whether this is a question of law.  I disagree with CKR that the tribunal “did determine at some length, this issue”.

There is also little to suggest that “jurisdiction” is required before a tribunal can make comments or certain observations about other legal proceedings.  No authority is cited for that proposition.  If the argument is that a tribunal has exceeded its remit, then the appropriate remedy is the setting aside of the award.

</div>  The emphasis here is once again on whether there is evidence of what the outcomes of Suit 1274 and CA 179 might be.  Nothing is said by CKR in terms of “jurisdiction”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 It is only subsequently at [56] and [61] of CKR’s CRS that “jurisdiction” is referenced.  But, neither reference to “jurisdiction” in these paragraphs assists CKR:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At [56], CKR argues that “both Suit 1274 and CA 179 involve claims concerning parties other than [CKR] and [Asplenium], whom the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over”.  It is immediately clear that this reference to “jurisdiction” has <span class="font-italic">no connection</span> with the tribunal having the “jurisdiction to assess the monetary value of such other matters and/or proceedings”.  Rather, it merely makes the fairly obvious point that the tribunal’s determinations do not, in and of themselves, bind persons who are not parties to the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Similarly, at [61], CKR makes the once again fairly trite point that “the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear and decide the claims in Suit 1274”.  This is entirely unsurprising – it is the Court and not the tribunal which has <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> to “hear and decide” the claims in Suit 1274.  Nothing that the tribunal says or determines in relation to Suit 1274 will <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> be binding on the Court which hears the Suit.  Pertinently, for present purposes, however, there is nothing in the relevant portion of CKR’s CRS which deals with whether or not the tribunal has the “jurisdiction” to <span class="font-italic">assess the monetary value</span> of matters and proceedings not before it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 After these two references to “jurisdiction” in CKR’s CRS, neither of which assist CKR’s present case, CKR continued to focus on the evidentiary issues rather than the alleged difficulty as to “jurisdiction”.  At [64] of CKR’s CRS, it argued that “the Tribunal’s observations [concerning Suit 1274 in Partial Award 1] were made without the benefit of full evidence…”.

</div>  On CKR’s proposed resolution of Question 2(c), the arbitral tribunal ought to evaluate the merits of the parties’ cases in assessing the monetary value of the proceedings not before it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I am unable to agree with CKR that there is a valid basis to grant leave to appeal in relation to Question 2(c).  I do not see how determination of this question would have a substantial effect on the rights of the parties.  Even if Question 2(c) is resolved in the way CKR seeks and the tribunal has to examine the merits of the parties’ cases in Suit 1274 and CA 179, I am not satisfied that this would change the tribunal’s determination of whether the Calderbank Offer was more favourable than the Award Sum.  In my view, the tribunal’s exercise of its discretion to award costs would be unaffected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In determining whether or not the Calderbank Offer was more favourable than the Award Sum, the tribunal had already proceeded on the <span class="font-italic">best case scenario</span> for CKR and assumed that it would succeed in both Suit 1274 and CA 179.  Even with this assumption, the tribunal nonetheless found that the excess of S$3.1 million between the Calderbank Offer and the Award Sum suggested “irresistibly” that CKR “would have been better off in accepting the Offer Sum”.

</div>  The tribunal had thus taken CKR’s case at its highest in deciding whether the Calderbank Offer was more favourable than the Award Sum.  Given this, I am not persuaded that the determination of Question 2(c) in CKR’s favour could have altered that decision in any way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In reaching its decision, the tribunal had relied on certain key findings of fact.  In this regard, I accept that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the tribunal found that CA 179 was not a monetary claim;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the tribunal found that Suit 1274 was materially linked to the arbitration, and that the claim by CKR against Asplenium in Suit 1274 would be disposed of by reason of the outcome of the arbitration.  The tribunal thus appeared to be of the view that CKR would not have been awarded any damages against Asplenium even if it succeeded in Suit 1274; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the tribunal went on to make a further finding that, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> CKR was successful in both<span class="font-italic"> </span>CA 179 and Suit 1274, the S$3.1 million difference between the Calderbank Offer and the eventual Award Sum would <span class="font-italic">still</span> be greater than any recovery it might obtain in those legal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 That the abovementioned observations are findings of fact was made clear by CKR’s own stance in the course of its oral arguments before me.  When it was highlighted by the Court that Asplenium’s case was that the tribunal had made findings of fact which were not open to challenge, CKR’s response was not to deny that they were findings of fact, but only to challenge the “jurisdiction” of the tribunal to make the said findings of fact.  CKR also did not deny, in its written submissions before me, that the findings referred to above were findings of fact made by the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It is accepted by both parties that findings of fact by an arbitral tribunal are not open to challenge.  In <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Chua Aik Kia (trading as Uni Sanitary Electrical Construction) </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 419 (“<span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span>”), Belinda Ang J stated at [16] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the arbitrator’s findings of fact are <span class="font-italic">conclusive</span>: it is irrelevant whether the court considers those findings of fact to be right or wrong … the court must decide any question of law arising from an award on the basis of an <span class="font-italic">unqualified acceptance</span> of the findings of fact of the arbitrator…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The Court in <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span> went on to state at [29] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the court will not interfere in the arbitrator’s findings of fact arrived at after an assessment and evaluation of the evidence. Admissibility of evidence, weight of the evidence and the inferences from it are essentially matters for the arbitrator. … The alleged question of law was an attempt to circumvent the rule that the arbitrator’s findings of fact are conclusive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 On the present facts, CKR’s argument that the Calderbank Offer should be given no weight because of evidential inadequacies is an argument which goes to the weight of the evidence and the inferences which may be drawn from it.  <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span> at [29] makes clear that the “weight of the evidence and the inferences from it” are matters for the arbitrator, and it is not open to CKR to seek to circumvent the arbitrator’s findings of fact by framing the challenge as one raising a question of law.  CKR’s attempt to raise a question of law by putting forward the question of whether the tribunal had the “jurisdiction” to make certain findings of fact appears to me to be a backdoor challenge of the type identified at [29] of <span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Seeing as the findings of fact at [72(a)] to [72(c)] are to be taken as conclusive, there does not appear to be anything which might alter the favourable weight given to the Calderbank Offer, even if Question 2(c) were determined in the way CKR seeks.  In my judgment, given the tribunal’s findings that, even if CKR succeeded in the two legal proceedings then pending before the Court, it would not have made a difference because of the gulf between the Award Sum and the Calderbank Offer, there is little point in deciding the question of whether the tribunal should have analysed the strength of the respective parties’ cases in the legal proceedings.  Accordingly, I am unable to accept that the determination of the question will substantially affect the rights of one or more of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I pause here to address CKR’s arguments in relation to how Suit 1274 and CA 179 could have altered the favourability of the Calderbank Offer.  CKR’s arguments are twofold.  First, CKR argues that the relief sought in Suit 1274 for conspiracy is wide enough to encompass the legal costs in the arbitration, which would not have been necessary but for the conspiracy.  CKR further argues that these legal costs exceed S$11 million, which sum may be awarded to CKR if it succeeds in Suit 1274, and which would suffice to overcome the S$3.1 million difference between the Calderbank Offer and the Award Sum.  Second, in relation to CA 179, CKR contends that the documents disclosed on a successful appeal may have impacted Suit 37, which was not even considered by the tribunal in its assessment of the Calderbank Offer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 CKR’s arguments in relation to Suit 1274 may be fairly quickly dealt with:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, CKR made no mention in its submissions before the tribunal which mentioned that the sum of S$11 million in legal costs would be sought as damages in Suit 1274.  This head of loss appears to have been an altogether new development which was raised only <span class="font-italic">after</span> the arbitration.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, there is considerable doubt as to whether seeking the sum of S$11 million in damages is viable, especially since Asplenium seeking to recover the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> cost of the arbitration has the practical effect of undoing <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the tribunal’s awards as to costs made in the Arbitration.  This would reverse the approximately S$4 million of costs awarded against CKR in Partial Award 2.  Also, more fundamentally, I fail to comprehend how CKR can recover its legal costs in connection with the arbitration in Suit 1274 when that arbitration concerned the validity of Asplenium’s termination of the Contract, and tribunal had concluded that the termination was valid.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, and most decisively, the sum of S$11 million in legal costs which are alleged to have been recoverable in Suit 1274 goes towards a question of fact which is not open to challenge.  Specifically, the question of whether S$11 million would have been recoverable in legal costs goes towards the question of whether or not the Calderbank Offer exceeded the best-case-scenario valuation of CKR’s claims against Asplenium.  As outlined at [72(c)] above, this question of fact was determined by the tribunal, and I accept the tribunal’s finding as conclusive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 CKR’s arguments in relation to CA 179 are also unpersuasive and may be swiftly disposed of:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, CKR’s appeal in CA 179 has already been dismissed (see [97] to [101] below) and the appeal can therefore have <span class="font-italic">no effect whatsoever</span> on whether or not the Award Sum is more favourable than the Calderbank Offer.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, even if one ignores the fact that CKR’s appeal in CA 179 has been unsuccessful, the success or failure of that appeal goes once again to the question of whether the Calderbank Offer exceeded the best-case-scenario valuation of CKR’s claims against Asplenium.  As stated above, this is a question of fact which the Court will not interfere with.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, and in any event, CA 179 pertained to and arose out of Suit 37, which was CKR’s claim in negligence against the quantity surveyor and the quantity surveying firms that priced the replacement tender (see [12(c)] above).  Asplenium was not even party to Suit 37, and I therefore fail to see how the determination of CA 179 in the context of Suit 37 would have substantially affected the rights of the present parties <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I am also not satisfied that Question 2(c) is an issue the tribunal was asked to determine.  CKR refers me to [44] of the Quantum Costs Award, where the tribunal “held that it was not required to inquire into the merits or the evidence relating to Suit 1274 and CA 179, but was only required to assume that CKR succeeded in both actions”.

</div>
</div>  Thus, according to CKR, Question 2(c) was an issue the tribunal was asked to determine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Having reviewed the Quantum Costs Award and CKR’s submissions on costs before the tribunal, I am unable to agree.  All the tribunal did in relation to the value of Suit 1274 and CA 179 was to indicate that a detailed evaluation of the merits of the parties’ cases in those actions was not needed because, even if one was to assume that CKR would succeed completely in those legal proceedings, that would still not suffice to render the Calderbank Offer less favourable than the Award Sum.  The tribunal’s point was that a favourable outcome for CKR in both Suit 1274 and CA 179 would not overcome the S$3.1 million difference between the Calderbank Offer and the Award Sum.  There was no determination by the tribunal on whether and when a tribunal <span class="font-italic">ought to </span>evaluate the merits of parties’ cases in separate legal proceedings.  It was thought by the arbitrator to be simply unnecessary for the purposes of his analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Quite apart from that, CKR’s submission that it had argued before the tribunal that “the Tribunal could not assess the value of Suit 1274 and CA 179 at the material time” (see [81] above) is also not entirely accurate.  From my review, the thrust of CKR’s arguments at [50] to [74] of its CRS was that the tribunal did not have sufficient evidence or material before it to assess the value of Suit 1274 and CA 179.  This is a question of evidential sufficiency, not whether the tribunal had the <span class="font-italic">power</span> to conduct such an assessment.  Properly understood, therefore, CKR’s argument before the tribunal was that there was insufficient evidence to allow the tribunal to evaluate the merits of the parties’ cases in Suit 1274 and CA 179.  CKR did not argue before the tribunal that it ought not to evaluate the merits of the parties’ cases <span class="font-italic">as a question of law or as a matter of principle</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The tribunal, having assessed the evidence before it, disagreed with CKR’s arguments.  The tribunal found that the evidence was sufficient for it to at least consider CKR’s best case scenario.  I am therefore of the view that Question 2(c) seeks to contrive a question of law from what was in effect a disagreement between the parties on evidential sufficiency and the weight to be given to the evidence.  Those areas of disagreement clearly concerned questions of fact.  As already mentioned, the findings of fact by the tribunal have to be given unqualified acceptance in the proceedings before me (see [74] to [76] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In summary, I find that CKR’s arguments in relation to Question 2(c) before the tribunal centred on questions of fact, not law.  Question 2(c) is framed as a question of law, but does not reflect what was really in contention before the tribunal.  I therefore do not find that Question 2(c) is a question that the tribunal was asked to determine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Accordingly, I find that the requirements in s 49(5) of the AA are not met in relation to Question 2(c).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Question 2(d)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Question 2(d) is concerned about whether an arbitral tribunal has the “jurisdiction” to determine the impact of its findings on a court proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It will be quite apparent that there is considerable similarity between Question 2(d) and Question 2(a).  Both relate to the “jurisdiction” of an arbitral tribunal, with Question 2(a) focused on the “jurisdiction” of the tribunal to assess the monetary value of proceedings not before it, and Question 2(d) focused on the “jurisdiction” of the tribunal to assess the impact of its findings on proceedings not before it.  In fact, the two questions are regarded as so similar that CKR’s written submissions accept that “(t)he arguments for this question overlap largely with the arguments for the first part of Question 2(a)” and further that “(t)he requirements of the Act are satisfied in respect of this question for the same reasons as they are satisfied in Question 2(a)”.

The paucity of references to “jurisdiction” before the tribunal notwithstanding, the complete absence of references to “jurisdiction” to “determine the impact of its findings on a court proceeding” in CKR’s submission to the tribunal is telling (see above from [58] to [66]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Next, I am of the view that the determination of Question 2(d) would not have a substantial effect on the rights of parties.  The tribunal’s finding of fact is that the Calderbank Offer would far exceed the Award Sum, and he had proceeded on the assumption that CKR would succeed in both Suit 1274 and the appeal in CA 179.  As such, regardless of whether or not the tribunal has “jurisdiction” to determine the impact of its findings on court proceedings, that is, whether the tribunal <span class="font-italic">could</span> decide that CKR’s claim against Asplenium in Suit 1274 would be disposed of because of the outcome of the arbitration, CKR would <span class="font-italic">not</span> have succeeded in persuading the tribunal that it should not be visited with an adverse costs award.  Put another way, Question 2(d) is both a hypothetical and an academic question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 A further point I would emphasise is that I am once again perplexed by CKR’s reference to “jurisdiction”, and in particular “jurisdiction to determine the impact of (the tribunal’s) findings on a Court proceeding”.  No authority is cited for the proposition that a tribunal specifically requires “jurisdiction” to comment on how its findings might affect any pending court proceedings, nor was any explanation provided as to how a tribunal would be making a “determination” in any manner binding on legal proceedings in Court.  To my mind, this confusion is caused by CKR’s loose usage of the term “jurisdiction” in its attempt to contrive a question of law that may be appealed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Court will be vigilant in guarding against attempts to frame a challenge to the tribunal’s findings of fact as a question of law.  I am of the view that Question 2(d) is such an attempt.  It is not a question that the tribunal was asked to determine, nor would it have any impact on the rights of the parties.  I am not satisfied that the s 49 AA requirements are met, and do not grant leave to appeal in relation to Question 2(d).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Category III</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Question 2(b)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The final category of questions raised by CKR concerns whether the tribunal can consider the favourability of a Calderbank offer where the offer seeks to settle a non-monetary claim that remains pending before another court or tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Given the specific reference in Question 2(b) to a “non-monetary claim that remains pending before another Court or tribunal”, it appears that CKR is referring specifically to CA 179.  It is common ground that Suit 1274 is a monetary claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 CKR submits that Question 2(b) is a question of law that substantially affects the rights of parties and for which it is just and proper to grant leave to appeal for the same reasons as Question 2(a).  CKR further submits that the issue is one the tribunal was asked to determine because the issue of whether a non-monetary claim ought to impact a tribunal’s assessment of the favourability of a Calderbank offer was placed “squarely” before the tribunal by reason of Asplenium’s submission to the arbitrator that “[n]o monetary sum is involved in respect of CA 179”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I am unable to agree with CKR that leave should be granted to appeal Question 2(b).  First, I am not convinced that determination of Question 2(b) would have a substantial impact on the rights of the parties.  Second, I am not satisfied that the tribunal was asked to determine Question 2(b).  I elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In relation to the submission that the determination of Question 2(b) would substantially affect the rights of the parties, CKR relies on its arguments in relation to the other questions it has raised.  These have already been dealt with above (see [70] to [77] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 More pertinently in relation to Question 2(b), however, is the fact that CA 179, which is the “non-monetary claim” referred to in the question, has already been disposed of since the issuance of the Quantum Costs Award.  CA 179 was dismissed in its entirety by the Court of Appeal on 17 September 2019, with costs ordered <span class="font-italic">against</span> CKR.  This resolution of CA 179 does not in any way operate in CKR’s favour if one is to assess the overall favourability of the Calderbank Offer <span class="font-italic">now</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Given that CA 179 has been dismissed in its entirety, the determination of Question 2(b), which pertains only to CA 179 and not Suit 1274, will have no impact on the rights of parties on the issue of value to be attributed to the Calderbank Offer by the arbitrator.  Put another way, Question 2(b) can have no bearing on the tribunal’s finding that the Calderbank Offer was more favourable than the Award Sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 CKR attempts to rebut this conclusion by arguing that the dismissal of CA 179 is “irrelevant because at the time that the Tribunal issued the [Quantum Costs] Award, CA 179 had yet to be heard”.

</div>  I find this to be a surprising submission.  It does not appear to cohere with the statutory framework.  Section 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA makes clear that the determination of the question has to substantially affect the rights of one or more of the parties.  If it is the case that the Court answering Question 2(b) in the way that CKR seeks in an appeal cannot possibly alter the favourable calculus of the Calderbank Offer given what is known now, it is difficult to understand how the s 49(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) AA limb can be satisfied.  The Court cannot shut its eyes to the known outcome of CA 179 simply because it had not been decided when the tribunal issued the Quantum Costs Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 A second ground for refusing leave to appeal is that Question 2(b) is not a question that the tribunal was asked to determine.  The “non-monetary” nature of CA 179 was not emphasised or even expressly raised by CKR in the submissions to the tribunal.  Instead, before the tribunal, CKR chose to focus on the issue of “costs to be awarded” in that appeal, which “may well go against [Asplenium]”.

</div>  Nothing turned on the “non-monetary” nature of CA 179 since, even on CKR’s own position in the arbitration, the only issue which was significant enough to be drawn to the arbitrator’s attention was the fact that costs might be ordered against Asplenium if the appeal was successful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 It may be appropriate to reproduce CKR’s CRS on this point:
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-dbb8f32c-00ce-4ff5-a85f-c270d54159bb" data-toggle="modal" type="button">47</button></sup>

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 As to CA 179, while this is a non-monetary claim, <span class="font-italic">there remains the issue of costs to be awarded</span>. These costs may well go against [Asplenium].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Given that CKR itself pointed to costs of CA 179 as the only worthwhile issue to highlight, I do not see how the tribunal was asked to assess or determine whether any specific “non-monetary” aspect of CA 179 would affect the favourability or otherwise of the Calderbank Offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 CKR argues that CA 179 could have had monetary consequences in terms of its impact on Suit 1274 and Suit 37.  But, as I have already pointed out, this issue was simply not raised before the tribunal.  In any event, this argument about the monetary consequences of CA 179 is a different proposition altogether from what is being raised in Question 2(b), which is about the “non-monetary” aspects of CA 179.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I pause to note that CKR cites several English authorities in its submissions before me which are to the effect that a party should not be precluded from raising a new point of law in respect of an issue on appeal simply because the precise point was not argued before the arbitrator.  These cases include <span class="font-italic">Petraco (Bermuda) Ltd v Petromed International SA and another </span>[1988] 1 WLR 896, and <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> London Borough of Islington v PGM Building Company Ltd </span>(Unreported, 19 November 1992), amongst others.  I do not propose to deal with these authorities given that Question 2(b) is untenable as a ground of appeal (see [98] to [101] above), but it suffices for me to observe that several of the cases CKR relies on concern the English Arbitration Act 1979 (c 42) (UK) (“English Arbitration Act 1979”).  The English Arbitration Act 1979 had no express requirement that the question of law sought to be appealed had to be one which the arbitral tribunal was asked to determine, and it is thus not directly comparable with s 49 of the AA.  For completeness, I note that the English Arbitration Act 1979 has since been replaced by the English Arbitration Act 1996, and that s 69(3) of the English Arbitration Act 1996 is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 49(5) of the AA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 For the reasons I have set out above, I find the requirements in s 49(5) of the AA are not met in relation to Question 2(b).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The case law on granting leave to appeal questions of law arising from an arbitral award illustrates that the threshold for the grant of such leave is a high one.  As was observed by Judith Prakash J, as she then was, in <span class="font-italic">Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings Ltd v Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 270 at [8]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court’s ability to supervise the conduct of arbitration proceedings and interfere with the outcome of those proceedings is <span class="font-italic">limited</span>. It is well established that the principle of party autonomy is to be given priority and that, even if a judge would have come to a different conclusion from that of the arbitrator, <span class="font-italic">that is not, in itself, a reason to set aside the award or allow an appeal to be brought against it</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The high threshold which must be crossed before the Court will exercise its discretion to grant leave to appeal a question of law arising from an arbitral award is explicable by reference to the <span class="font-italic">raison d’etre</span> of arbitration.  As observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Chin Siau and others v How Kim Chuan </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 809 at [52]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[P]arties having <span class="font-italic">chosen </span>to arbitrate should usually be bound by the finding of the tribunal and not that of the court … the substitution of the court’s view for that of the tribunal might actually subvert the <span class="font-italic">agreement of the parties</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Beyond the threshold which must be met, s 49 of the AA is clear in setting out the requirements before leave to appeal shall be granted.  These requirements are cumulative, and all of them must be satisfied before leave to appeal may be granted.  On the instant facts, at least some of the requirements for the grant of leave to appeal the questions framed by CKR have not been met.  Accordingly, there is no basis for me to grant leave to appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As a final note, let me caution that parties should carefully consider and evaluate offers to settle disputes.  They represent an avenue to minimise the costs of litigation, and can save considerable time and resources.  It is for this reason that there may be consequences when they are unjustifiably ignored.  While my decision does not at all turn on this point, the Calderbank Offer appeared to be a generous one, particularly when one compares it to the eventual Award Sum in the arbitration.  If there were uncertainties about the precise ambit of the offer, CKR could have sought to clarify them.  No such clarification was sought.  This appeal appears to me an attempt to nullify the effects of the unaccepted Calderbank Offer given the eventual outcome of the arbitration, and might have been avoided had the Calderbank Offer been given proper consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I will deal with the issue of costs separately.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Sien Liang Joseph, Corinne Taylor, Qabir Singh Sandhu and Yap Pei Yin (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Chuah Chee Kian Christopher, Kua Lay Theng, Chain Xiao Wei Edmund and Rachael Chong Rae-Hua (WongPartnership LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
