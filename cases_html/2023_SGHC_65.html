The misconduct that is in issue before us arose out of comments which Mr Ravi made when he was interviewed by The Online Citizen Asia (“TOC Asia”) and other comments he subsequently posted on Facebook following the release of the Court of Appeal’s oral grounds in <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>”) on 19 October 2020. Mr Ravi’s remarks suggested improper conduct on the part of the Attorney-General, the then-Deputy Attorney-General Mr Hri Kumar Nair (the “DAG”), the prosecutors from the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”) who had been involved in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>, and the Law Society. At the time of the alleged misconduct, Mr Ravi was an advocate and solicitor of 20 years’ standing and was practising with Carson Law Chambers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Following a complaint made by the DAG in respect of Mr Ravi’s various comments, a disciplinary tribunal (the “DT”) was convened to investigate four primary and three alternative charges which were preferred against Mr Ravi under s 83(2) of the LPA. The DT found that three of the four primary charges against Mr Ravi were made out, but found that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action arose. It ordered Mr Ravi to pay a total penalty of $6,000 in respect of those charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Dissatisfied, the Law Society filed OS 2 on 20 January 2022 pursuant to s 94(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA, and contended that Mr Ravi’s misconduct amounted to due cause and warranted the imposition of more serious sanctions under s 83(1) of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 We begin by setting out the backdrop against which Mr Ravi’s misconduct arose, starting with the criminal proceedings and various related events that culminated in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>. This will help explain the kernel of Mr Ravi’s remarks which form the subject of the present disciplinary proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Criminal proceedings involving Gobi</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 11 December 2014, one Gobi a/l Avedian (“Gobi”) was arrested on suspicion of having in his possession two packets of granular substance containing a prohibited drug. In HC/CC 13/2017 (“CC 13”), which commenced on 31 January 2017, Gobi was charged under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), punishable by death under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA, for importing the two packets of granular substance found to contain not less than 40.22g of diamorphine, a controlled drug under Class A of the First Schedule to the MDA (the “Drugs”). Gobi’s defence counsel at the time was Mr Shashi Nathan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At trial, the sole issue before the High Court was whether Gobi had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA (the “s 18(2) MDA presumption”). Section 18(2) of the MDA states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>— …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his or her possession is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 At first instance, Gobi’s case was that he thought the Drugs were a form of mild controlled drug mixed with chocolate, and thus that he did <span class="font-italic">not know</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the Drugs were a Class A controlled drug. The Prosecution’s case was that Gobi “<span class="font-italic">knew</span> or was <span class="font-italic">wilfully blind</span> as to the nature of the drugs” [emphasis added]: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian </span>[2017] SGHC 145 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Trial)</span>”) at [2]. At the conclusion of the trial, the High Court found Gobi’s testimony credible, and that he had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA: see <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Trial) </span>at [53]. The High Court accordingly acquitted Gobi on the charge that was brought but convicted him on an amended lesser charge of attempting to import the Drugs believing it to be a controlled drug under Class C. Gobi was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane on the amended charge and acquitted of the capital charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Prosecution appealed against Gobi’s acquittal on the capital charge in CA/CCA 20/2017 (“CCA 20”). The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and held that Gobi had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. On 25 October 2018, it set aside Gobi’s conviction on the amended charge and convicted Gobi of the original capital charge: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian</span> [2019] 1 SLR 113 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Appeal)</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Mr Ravi began acting for Gobi in September 2019. On 3 January 2020, he filed on behalf of Gobi an application for leave to commence criminal review proceedings against the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Appeal)</span> pursuant to s 394H of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”). The Court of Appeal granted leave for Gobi to file a review application pursuant to s 394I of the CPC. On 25 February 2020, Gobi duly filed CA/CM 3/2020 (“CM 3”), seeking a review of <span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Appeal)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 This application was premised on a separate decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 2 SLR 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Adili</span>”) that had been released some months earlier on 27 May 2019, but some months <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Court of Appeal rendered its decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, the accused person had appealed against the High Court’s decision convicting him of trafficking in a capital amount of methamphetamine and sentencing him to the mandatory death penalty. Both at first instance and on appeal, the Prosecution relied on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, which provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>—(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Prosecution’s case, however, was that the accused had been wilfully blind to the existence of the drugs in question. The Court of Appeal held that the Prosecution could not invoke the s 18(1) MDA presumption in relation to wilful blindness because the s 18(1) presumption was a presumption of <span class="font-italic">fact </span>while the doctrine of wilful blindness was a construct of <span class="font-italic">law</span> which described a mental state falling short of actual knowledge but that was treated as its <span class="font-italic">legal </span>equivalent. The Court of Appeal, however, left open the question of whether the same was true of <span class="font-italic">s 18(2</span><span class="font-italic">)</span> of the MDA: see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [69].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Gobi’s applications for prohibitory and declaratory orders in relation to his execution  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Separately, Mr Ravi on 28 January 2020 filed HC/OS 111/2020 (“OS 111”) on behalf of Gobi and one Datchinamurthy a/l Kataiah (“Datchinamurthy”). Datchinamurthy too had been sentenced to the mandatory death sentence after being convicted of trafficking in a quantity of drugs exceeding the threshold for the imposition of capital punishment: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Christeen d/o Jayamany and another </span>[2015] SGHC 126. Gobi and Datchinamurthy sought (amongst other orders) a prohibitory order to stay their executions in the light of their allegations that executions were being carried out by prison officials kicking prisoners on the back of the neck.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 4 February 2020, a pre-trial conference was convened at the request of Mr Wong Woon Kwong of the AGC (“Mr Wong”). Mr Wong sought urgent hearing dates on account of the gravity of the allegations contained in OS 111. In particular, Mr Wong added that he was “... instructed to state that we are expressly reserving all our rights against Mr Ravi” (the “Reservation Statement”). Mr Ravi sought to clarify the meaning of the Reservation Statement during the hearing, but was directed by the Assistant Registrar to seek clarifications from the AGC thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 10 February 2020, Mr Ravi filed HC/OS 181/2020 (“OS 181”) on behalf of Gobi and Datchinamurthy, seeking a declaration that the Reservation Statement constituted a breach of their right to a fair hearing. OS 111 and OS 181 were heard together on 13 February 2020 and dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Returning to Gobi’s review application, CM 3 was heard by a five-Judge panel of the Court of Appeal on 19 October 2020. Brief grounds of the Court of Appeal’s judgment were delivered on the same day (the “Brief Grounds”), setting out its reasons for setting aside Gobi’s conviction on the capital charge and reinstating Gobi’s conviction on the amended charge imposed in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span><span class="font-italic"> (Trial)</span>. At [9] of its Brief Grounds, the Court of Appeal made the following observation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although we had, in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, expressly confined the aforesaid holdings to the s 18(1) presumption of possession, on the face of it, they seem likely to also apply to the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge. In this light, <span class="font-italic">we reviewed the record and observed what seemed to us to be an inconsistency between the Prosecution’s case at the trial and its case on appeal in respect of the state of the Applicant’s knowledge of the nature of the Drugs</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Court of Appeal then found that the Prosecution’s case had <span class="font-italic">changed</span> from one of wilful blindness <span class="font-italic">at trial </span>to one of actual knowledge <span class="font-italic">on appeal</span>. In this regard, the Court of Appeal observed that “[t]his change in the Prosecution’s case was ultimately prejudicial to [Gobi] because he was never squarely confronted with the case that he did not in fact believe what he had been told by [the relevant persons], and so he could not have responded to such a case” (see the Brief Grounds at [20]). As the Prosecution’s case at trial was premised on wilful blindness, the court held that the Prosecution was not entitled to rely on the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Court of Appeal’s full written judgment in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review</span><span class="font-italic">) </span>was released after the hearing of CM 3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Statements made by Mr Ravi in his interview with TOC Asia  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Shortly after the delivery of the Brief Grounds on 19 October 2020, Mr Ravi was interviewed by TOC Asia outside the Supreme Court building (the “Interview”). When requested to comment on Gobi’s criminal proceedings, Mr Ravi made the following remarks:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Yes, this morning, the Court of Appeal has set aside the death sentence of Gobi Avedian, who is a Malaysian, on account of miscarriage of justice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This has made judicial history in Singapore, because it is for the first time that a case, a death penalty case, which has run its course to the Court of Appeal, after the clemency petition has been rejected by the President on the advice of the Cabinet, after all has been gone and when Gobi or the death penalty inmate has been facing an execution, that this case had been reviewed by the Court after we filed an application, and the Court has reviewed its previous decision, the Court of Appeal. And the Court of Appeal concluded that the previous decision is demonstrably wrong. Demonstrably wrong on the basis that there was another decision by the Court of Appeal that established the principles of willful blindness, which the previous Court of Appeal did not have the benefit. So therefore, when I filed the application, I pointed to the Court that in view of the latest decision, in the case of <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, this Court of Appeal case on the definition of willful blindness. The Court of Appeal accepted that in view of the latest decision, in this case the previous decision in the current case of Gobi is demonstrably wrong, and therefore Gobi has suffered a miscarriage of justice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">And<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">one of the things which is troubling in this decision today, is that the Court noted that the</span><span class="font-italic"> Attorney-General, or the Public Prosecutor ran a different case in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Then that begs the question and calls into [sic] the fairness of the administration of justice in Gobi’s case by the Prosecution</span>, because the Prosecution has a duty as ministers of justice to be fair. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a defence counsel, I only have a role towards my client. But the Prosecution in prosecuting people, especially for death penalty, it is extremely important that you must be fair to both sides, the accused, and the State. So therefore, balancing this, the State has been overzealous in his prosecution,<span class="font-weight-bold"> the</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Public Prosecutor has been overzealous in his prosecution and that has led to the death sentence of Gobi</span>. In fact, Gobi was acquitted originally in the High Court, then his conviction/acquittal was overturned by the Court of Appeal when the Prosecution appealed. Now, after this review application, the Court of Appeal set aside its previous decision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">And what is crucial to bear in mind, is the numerous threats, the Government of Singapore gave me in defending Gobi. I suffered tremendous stress, to the extent that I even have to discontinue myself in acting in one of the appeal cases, he did in another application … I accept that you have to be careful about applications. But what if I had not taken up this? It is not that I am gloating over this, I could have given up anytime because of the threat.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Government of Singapore said in one of another application when I was defending Gobi, that it will reserve its rights against me personally, and in this application when we filed before the Court of Appeal in Gobi’s case, the Prosecution submitted that it is an abuse of process. Abuse of process means a threat of cost order can be coming, a complaint to the Law Society is coming, or may potentially come. All these things will affect my licence to practice. How can I be effective for other clients as well?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am saying this to the State and the Prosecution and the Minister of Law. <span class="font-underline">Please apologise to Gobi,</span><span class="font-underline"> and for the suffering, his family, and he has gone through during this process, because the Prosecution, as the Court observed, ran a different case in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. So therefore, the Prosecution, essentially the fairness of the Prosecution, is called into question by the Court itself.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics, bold and underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We refer to the statement in italics above as the “First Interview Statement”; to the statement in bold above as the “Second Interview Statement”; and to the underlined statement above as the “Third Interview Statement”.

In the Reply Letter, Mr Ravi acknowledged that he had made the Interview Statements but rejected the allegation in the DAG’s Letter that the statements had been made with the knowledge that they were false, or that any obligations under the LPA and the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015) (the “PCR”) had been breached when he made those statements. He maintained that there was sufficient basis, “both objective and subjective”, for the statements to be made. Accordingly, Mr Ravi took the position that the AGC’s requests for a public apology and retraction of the relevant statements were “not only plainly without basis, but also insulting given the fact that [the AGC had] treated Gobi’s life with such a blatant disregard, whom [Mr Ravi] was trying to save at the eleventh hour and which he eventually succeeded”. He concluded the Reply Letter by stating that “[r]egardless of the Prosecution’s apology…, we have firm instructions from Gobi and his family to commence legal action and enforce his rights against [the AG, the DAG], and members of the Prosecution who had carriage of this matter in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Ravi uploaded the Reply Letter in a Facebook post on the same day.

It was alleged that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>had committed the tort of misfeasance in public office and were in breach of their statutory duty under the PCR. The AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> successfully applied to strike out the Statement of Claim in Suit 1068 and the action was dismissed by the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proceedings before the DT</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 On 23 October 2020 (one day after the Second Facebook Post was published), the DAG referred a complaint against Mr Ravi to the Law Society pursuant to s 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA (the “Complaint”). The Complaint was made in relation to the Interview Statements, the First Facebook Post and the Second Facebook Post, and requested that the Law Society refer the matter to a disciplinary tribunal.

class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Following the hearing before the DT, which took place from 28 to 29 July 2021, the DT released its findings in its report dated 20 December 2021 (the “DT Report”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In relation to the First Charge, the DT considered that the key issue was whether the Interview Statements constituted fair criticism. This was Mr Ravi’s sole defence to the First Charge before the DT. In the DT’s determination, whether the Interview Statements constituted fair criticism depended in turn on whether Mr Ravi had “any rational basis” for making these statements. The DT found it relevant to consider the factors set out in <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">ttorney-General v Tan Liang Joo John</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1132 at [15]–[23] (and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan v Attorney-General</span> [2011] 3 SLR 778) in the context of the law of contempt of court. Applying these factors, the DT found that Mr Ravi had a rational basis for making all three Interview Statements and that the First Charge was not made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In relation to the Second Charge, the DT found that Mr Ravi had failed to treat the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> with courtesy and fairness in breach of s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA read with r 7(2) of the PCR, by publicly communicating his intention to commence an action against them in the First Facebook Post. In this regard, the DT accepted Mr Ravi’s explanation that the use of the word “wrongdoers” referred to those responsible for the commission of a civil rather than a criminal wrong, and that the Second Facebook Statement was not a threat made by Mr Ravi to commence legal proceedings. The DT found, however, that it was not proper of Mr Ravi to have made allegations of misconduct without referring the matter to the appropriate body.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For the Third Charge, the DT found that Mr Ravi, by making the Third Facebook Statement, had acted in a manner contrary to a legal practitioner’s position as a member of an honourable profession pursuant to s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA read with r 8(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PCR. In the DT’s view, the Third Facebook Statement constituted a threat against the Law Society and an accusation that it was complicit in alleged “harassment” by the AG. The fact that Mr Ravi had made the statement in a public forum also compounded the severity of his misconduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In relation to the Fourth Charge, the DT relied on its reasoning with respect to the Second Charge to find that Mr Ravi had similarly breached s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA read with r 7(2) of the PCR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In the round, however, the DT determined that there was no cause of sufficient gravity disclosed by Mr Ravi’s misconduct, as the misconduct in question did not “involve dishonesty ... trustworthiness or moral turpitude, or a conviction for a criminal offence”. It ordered that Mr Ravi pay a monetary penalty, pursuant to s 93(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA, comprising the following sums:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>For the Second and Fourth Charges, a collective penalty of $4,000.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>For the Third Charge, a penalty of $2,000.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Attorney-General’s application to review the DT’s findings on the First Charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Dissatisfied with this result, the Attorney-General proceeded to file HC/OS 41/2022 (“OS 41”) on 18 January 2022. OS 41 was an application to review the DT’s findings in relation to the First Charge pursuant to s 97(1) of the LPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 OS 41 was heard on 5 and 12 May 2022 before a judge of the General Division of the High Court (the “Judge”), who dismissed OS 41 and found that the Interview Statements did not necessarily imply that the Prosecution had acted with malice, in bad faith or improperly: see <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Ravi s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy and another </span>[2022] SGHC 180 (“<span class="font-italic">AG v Ravi</span>”). In particular, the Judge was of the view that (see <span class="font-italic">AG v Ravi </span>at [31]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The statements were supported by a rational basis – that the Prosecution’s advancement of a different case on appeal in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>], premised on actual knowledge of the drugs instead of wilful blindness as put forward at trial in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Trial</span>)], <span class="font-italic">did</span> cause prejudice to Gobi. This was specifically highlighted by the Court of Appeal in both its Oral Judgment and subsequent written grounds in the Review Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Two days after OS 41 was filed, the Law Society filed the present application on 20 January 2022 for Mr Ravi to be dealt with pursuant to s 83(1) of the LPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 With this background in mind, we turn to consider the parties’ cases in OS 2. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Law Society’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Law Society agrees with the DT’s determination that the Second to Fourth Charges are made out, and raises no issue in relation to the First Charge given the decision in <span class="font-italic">AG v Ravi</span>. However, it disagrees with the DT’s determination under s 93(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under s 83 of the LPA. It argues that Mr Ravi’s misconduct is sufficiently serious to warrant the imposition of sanctions under s 83(1) of the LPA, and makes three main submissions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>First, the Law Society contends that the DT erred in relation to the applicable test for whether a cause of sufficient gravity arose. It submits that the applicable test is whether the impugned conduct is sufficiently serious and this is not confined to conduct that fell within the categories of “dishonesty ... trustworthiness or moral turpitude, or a conviction for a criminal offence”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>Second, the DT failed to give adequate weight to the implications of Mr Ravi’s conduct. In particular, the DT overlooked the fact that the AG and the Law Society, being the subject of Mr Ravi’s various statements, were important legal institutions. It was also highlighted that despite being a senior member of the Bar, Mr Ravi had expressed these statements in a public manner (where he had a significant online following) and adopted a scornful tone in so doing.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>Third, the DT failed to consider the “blatant and wilful” manner in which Mr Ravi breached the PCR. In this regard, the Law Society contends that Mr Ravi had voiced his objections publicly in order to drum up public pressure against the AGC and the Law Society.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In relation to the appropriate sanction, the Law Society submits that the penalties ordered by the DT are inadequate. It highlights, amongst other things, Mr Ravi’s disciplinary antecedents and his lack of remorse, and seeks an order that Mr Ravi be suspended from practice pursuant to s 83(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA. As for the duration of the suspension, counsel for the Law Society, Ms Lin Weiqi Wendy (“Ms Lin”) initially took the position that a suspension of three months was appropriate. Her final position, when given the opportunity to address this court in reply (after Mr Ravi had made his oral submissions), however, was that a suspension that exceeded 15 months should be imposed instead.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Ravi’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Mr Ravi was initially represented in these proceedings by Eugene Thuraisingam LLP. Written and skeletal submissions were filed on his behalf on 15 September 2022 and 17 October 2022 respectively (collectively referred to as the “Written Submissions”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the Written Submissions, Mr Ravi indicated his agreement with the DT’s determination in its entirety. Mr Ravi’s Written Submissions in relation to the seriousness of the misconduct under the Second to Fourth Charges may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>He had referred to the “government lawyers” as “wrongdoers” in the sense of their having committed a “civil wrong”. This did not amount to serious misconduct.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>He felt threatened by the Reservation Statement and, in making the First and Third Facebook Statement, had reacted under pressure rather than out of “calculation or artifice”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 On the appropriate sanction, Mr Ravi argued in his Written Submissions that the monetary penalty issued by the DT is in line with precedents concerning allegations against important legal institutions made in a public forum. He further argued that his previous disciplinary antecedents should not be accorded great weight where those antecedents involved his suffering from bipolar disorder. Mr Ravi also highlighted his remorse and <span class="font-italic">pro bono</span> contributions in mitigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 On 20 October 2022, Mr Ravi filed a notice of intention to act in person in place of his solicitors, and subsequently represented himself at the hearing of this matter before us on 9 November 2022. In his oral submissions, Mr Ravi accepted that he had made the allegations contained in the Interview Statements and Facebook Statements, but raised the following arguments: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>First, his conduct had to be viewed in light of the “seriousness of the miscarriage of justice” that Gobi faced. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>Second, his conduct had to be seen in the context of “cause lawyering”. This also explained why Mr Ravi had made the impugned statements in public, as “it should not be a private matter when … a miscarriage of justice has taken place”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>Third, Mr Ravi viewed himself as a person under disability, and that the court should therefore consider his rights under the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (“CRPD”). He emphasised, in this regard, that he had been operating under tremendous stress at the time and had made the review application “despite the threats” by the AG in the Reservation Statement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(d) </span>Fourth, his misconduct had to be assessed against the unfairness with which the AG had allegedly conducted its case throughout the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings. He alleged that it was dishonest of the AG to have continued to resist the review proceedings despite the court having raised the issue of the Prosecution’s change of case in the course of those proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Further, we observe that Mr Ravi adopted a far more combative stance during his oral submissions, which belied the remorse he claimed to have in his Written Submissions. In fact, Mr Ravi went <span class="font-italic">further</span> by suggesting at various junctures impropriety on the part of the <span class="font-italic">court</span> in the conduct of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings, an allegation that hitherto had not been raised in the Interview, the Facebook Posts or in the course of the disciplinary proceedings: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Menon CJ: Well, the question really is whether you conduct yourself in the manner of an honourable profession.

It is also undisputed that Mr Ravi’s conduct in relation to the Second to Fourth Charges constitutes improper conduct within s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA for breaching rr 7(2) and 8(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PCR. A determination that the advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one of the limbs of s 83(2) is, however, a “<span class="font-italic">necessary </span><span class="font-italic">– but not sufficient – condition</span>” [emphasis in original] in determining whether due cause has arisen (<span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine </span><span class="font-italic">Gowriwamni d/o Daniel</span> [2010] 3 SLR 390 (“<span class="font-italic">Jasmine </span><span class="font-italic">Gowriwamni</span>”) at [35]); and it is here that the parties join issue. Therefore, the central inquiry here is whether, on the “totality of the facts and circumstances of the case”, Mr Ravi’s misconduct is “<span class="font-italic">sufficiently serious to warrant the imposition of sanctions under s 83(1) of the LPA</span>” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju and another matter </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1369 (“<span class="font-italic">Udeh</span><span class="font-italic"> Kumar</span>”) at [30]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 We first consider the Law Society’s argument that the DT had erred in the test it applied in determining whether a cause of sufficient gravity arose. In our judgment, there was no real divergence <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">between</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> the standard applied by the DT and that set out in the preceding paragraph. It is apparent from the DT Report that the DT was cognisant of its role as a “sieve” to ensure that only the most serious complaints are referred to the Court of Three Judges, having cited at para 169 of the DT Report the observations of this court to similar effect in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Jasmine </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Gowrimani</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [24] (see also </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Jasmine </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Gowrimani</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [28])</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.

In this connection, we consider it helpful to revisit the DT’s analysis in respect of the First Charge. While the First Charge is, strictly speaking, not in issue before this court, a detailed examination of the DT’s findings on that point not only sheds light on why the DT saw fit to dismiss the First Charge, but also provides a valuable perspective on how the DT viewed Mr Ravi’s misconduct </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">as a whole</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> in</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> arriving at its determination that no cause of sufficient gravity arose.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The First Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 To recapitulate, the First Charge concerned whether Mr Ravi had acted in a manner unbefitting an advocate and solicitor under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA by advancing false and/or misleading allegations in the First to Third Interview Statements which intended to convey that the Public Prosecutor and/or the AG had acted in bad faith, maliciously and/or improperly. These statements are set out in full at [18] above and we reproduce them below for reference:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span><span class="font-weight-bold">The First Interview Statement</span>: “<span class="font-italic">…</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>one of the things which is troubling in this decision today, is that the Court noted that the Attorney-General, or the Public Prosecutor ran a different case in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Then that begs the question and calls into the fairness of the administration of justice in Gobi’s case by the Prosecution, because the Prosecution has a duty as ministers of justice to be fair<span class="font-italic">.</span>”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span><span class="font-weight-bold">The Second Interview Statement</span>: “… the Public Prosecutor has been overzealous in his prosecution and that has led to the death sentence of Gobi …”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span><span class="font-weight-bold">The Third Interview Statement</span>: “Please apologise to Gobi, and for the suffering, his family, and he has gone through during this process, because the Prosecution, as the Court observed, ran a different case in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. So therefore, the Prosecution, essentially the fairness of the Prosecution, is called into question by the Court itself.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As explained at [31] above, the DT took the view that whether the First Charge was made out turned on whether Mr Ravi had “any rational basis” for making each of the three statements. In relation to the Second Interview Statement, the DT considered that the question was whether Mr Ravi had a rational basis for describing the Prosecution’s conduct of the Gobi proceedings as “overzealous”.  It therefore began its analysis on the Second Interview Statement by considering the conduct of the Prosecution in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Trial)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>. The DT then turned to <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>, where it noted that the Court of Appeal had found “a change in the Prosecution’s case in [CCA 20] because ... the Prosecution’s case in [CCA 20] before the Court of Appeal was one of actual knowledge, and that such change in the case it ran in [CCA 20] prejudiced Gobi”. Upon consideration of the Prosecution’s fundamental duty to assist in the administration of justice, the DT concluded that the Second Interview Statement was not devoid of rational basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Turning to the First Interview Statement, the DT found that there was a rational basis for Mr Ravi to have used the term “troubling” and that the Court of Appeal’s observation that the Prosecution had run different cases “call[ed] into question the fairness of the administration of justice in Gobi’s case by the Prosecution”. This was because, in the DT’s view, “even the Court of Appeal itself before the review hearing was troubled over this issue”, having directed further submissions on this point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Finally, with respect to the Third Interview Statement, the DT found that there was a rational basis for Mr Ravi to articulate the view that “the fairness of the Prosecution [was] called into question by the Court”. This was for the sole reason that the Court of Appeal had in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span> noted that “the Prosecution’s change in the case that it ran on appeal, as compared to the case that it ran at the trial, prejudiced [Gobi]”. It was for these reasons that the DT concluded that the First Charge was not made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 While the DT’s findings in respect of the First Charge are not directly in issue in these proceedings, we express our views in relation to these findings as they have a bearing on our analysis of Mr Ravi’s misconduct that forms the subject of the Second to Fourth Charges. To state our views at the outset, we do not agree with the DT’s interpretation or analysis of the First to Third Interview Statements<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span> We make three observations in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, and with respect, the DT did not appear to consider the full ambit of the Court of Appeal’s observations in the Brief Grounds in its analysis of whether Mr Ravi had a rational basis to make the Interview Statements. We highlight the Brief Grounds because, according to Mr Ravi, he had given the TOC Interview immediately <span class="font-italic">after</span> the delivery of the Brief Grounds, but <span class="font-italic">before</span> he had obtained the full written judgment in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review</span>). His Interview Statements, therefore, had to be seen in light of the entirety of the Court of Appeal’s observations in the Brief Grounds. As is apparent from our brief summary of the DT’s findings in the foregoing paragraphs, however, the DT focussed its assessment on the Court of Appeal’s finding that the Prosecution had run a different case at trial and on appeal, and that this had caused prejudice to Gobi. As such, the DT observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">111. The Court of Appeal in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>] noted that there was a change in the Prosecution’s case in the Appeal because it is undisputed that the Prosecution’s case in the earlier Appeal before the Court of Appeal was one of actual knowledge, and that such change in the case it ran in the earlier Appeal prejudiced Gobi …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">112. In [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>], the Court of Appeal also took the opportunity to further emphasise the importance of the Prosecution running a consistent case so as to give the accused a fair chance of knowing the case that is advanced against him and what evidence he has to adduce (and what standard of proof) in order to meet that case, and that the Prosecution is not permitted to seek a conviction on a factual premise which it has never advanced, and which it has in fact denied in its case against the accused person (see [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>] at [119])</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">115. It cannot be gainsaid that where the offence(s) for which the accused person is charged carries the death penalty and what may be expressed as the near-irretrievable finality of punishment, as in the case of the criminal proceedings against Gobi, it is even more imperative and essential that the Prosecution strictly and scrupulously observes it role, functions and duties …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116. Having regard to the above findings and observations made by the Court of Appeal in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span> and the Brief Grounds], as well as the Court’s exposition on the role and duty of the Prosecution in criminal proceedings, we are of the view that it cannot be said that the First Statement is devoid of any reasonable, rational or objective basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 What was absent from the DT’s analysis, however, was any reference to the Court of Appeal’s express qualification in the Brief Grounds that the Prosecution <span class="font-italic">could not have </span>anticipated or perceived that it had <span class="font-italic">impermissibly</span> changed its case at the time <span class="font-italic">due to the </span><span class="font-italic">extant understanding of the law</span>. This, in turn, requires a more granular examination of the procedural history of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings, the relevant episodes of which we summarise below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>On 28 June 2017, the High Court found that Gobi had rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA that he knew that the granular substance in his possession was diamorphine. Gobi was convicted on an amended lesser charge of attempting to import diamorphine, believing it to be a controlled drug under Class C of the First Schedule to the MDA. In the course of trial, the trial judge sought clarification from the Prosecution on whether its case was that Gobi “should not have believed” the representations of the persons passing him the drugs (“Vinod” and “Jega”) or that he “did not believe” these persons. The Prosecution confirmed that its case was the former. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>On 25 October 2018, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span><span class="font-italic">(Appeal)</span> held that Gobi had failed to rebut the s 18(2) MDA presumption and convicted Gobi of the capital charge. In the Prosecution’s written submissions, it had taken the position that Gobi <span class="font-italic">did not in fact believe</span> Vinod and Jega.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>On 27 May 2019, the Court of Appeal released its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>. It clarified an important point of law for the first time, which was that the doctrine of wilful blindness had no relevance in the analysis of whether the presumption under s 18(1) of the MDA had been rebutted (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [71]). Notably, it confined this finding strictly to the issue of knowing possession under s 18(1) of the MDA (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]), and left open the question of whether the same applied to s 18(2) of the MDA (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [69]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(d) </span>On 25 February 2020, Mr Ravi filed CM 3, seeking a review of <span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Appeal)</span> in light of <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>. In his written submissions filed on behalf of Gobi on the same day, Mr Ravi argued, amongst other things, that the Court of Appeal had erred in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Appeal)</span> to the extent that it had premised the conviction of Gobi on wilful blindness. This argument was erroneous and seems to have been based on Mr Ravi’s view that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> had held that the doctrine of wilful blindness had no application to <span class="font-italic">s 18(2) of the MDA</span>. In fact, as we had noted in the preceding sub-paragraph, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>had explicitly left open the question of whether and how <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>might affect the s 18(2) MDA presumption.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(e) </span>On 20 April 2020, the Supreme Court Registry sent a letter to the respective parties in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>, conveying the Court of Appeal’s direction to the parties to file further written submissions (the “Registry Letter”). The Court of Appeal highlighted that <span class="font-italic">contrary to Mr Ravi’s submissions</span>, it had <span class="font-italic">not</span> in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> settled the question of the interface between the doctrine of wilful blindness and s 18(2) of the MDA (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span> at [36] where the Court of Appeal clarified the same). As such, it directed parties to file further submissions on this issue. It also sought further submissions as to whether the Prosecution had run a different case in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Trial)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Appeal)</span> in relation to Gobi’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs, and if so whether such a change was permissible. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(f) </span>In its further submissions dated 1 June 2020, the Prosecution maintained that its cases at trial and on appeal were both premised on Gobi’s actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(g) </span>As for Mr Ravi, as we note below at [138], in his submissions filed on the same day, Mr Ravi maintained that <span class="font-italic">there was no prejudice to Gobi</span> occasioned by the change of case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(h) </span>On 19 October 2020, the Court of Appeal set aside Gobi’s conviction on the capital charge and reinstated Gobi’s conviction on the amended charge in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Trial)</span>. It held for the first time that its holdings in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>extended also to the s 18(2) MDA presumption. The Court of Appeal concluded that the Prosecution’s case in the High Court trial had in fact been run on the basis of wilful blindness but that it had run its case on appeal on the premise that Gobi <span class="font-italic">actually </span><span class="font-italic">knew</span> of the nature of the drugs. Notably, the Court of Appeal highlighted at [9] of the Brief Grounds that “[t]his issue <span class="font-italic">was not raised</span> by [Gobi] in [CCA 20] or in the initial submissions [in CM 3]” [emphasis added], but instead that it was raised for the first time <span class="font-italic">on the Court</span><span class="font-italic"> of Appeal’s own motion</span> in the Registry Letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It is pertinent to reiterate here that <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was released <span class="font-italic">after</span> the conclusion of the proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>. The clarification in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> regarding the distinction between the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> concept of wilful blindness and the <span class="font-italic">factual</span> nature of the evidential presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA, therefore, had not yet found expression in our case law at the time. In this regard, and critically for present purposes, the Court of Appeal observed at [19] of the Brief Grounds<span class="font-italic"> </span>that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">In fairness to the parties, at the time of the trial, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">they did not have the benefit of the guidance subsequently set out in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Adili</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> The DPP might thus have formulated the Prosecution’s case on the premise that <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge and wilful blindness were not distinct concepts</span>, and that <span class="font-italic">the doctrine of wilful blindness was relevant in considering whether the s 18(2) presumption had been rebutted</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">We have now held that this is incorrect in law</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Crucially, the Court of Appeal in its Brief Grounds went further to explain how the confluence of certain material circumstances had led to its determination to set aside its earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal</span><span class="font-italic">)</span> (see the Brief Grounds at [23] and [24]; <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span><span class="font-italic">(Review) </span>at [125] and [126]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 In the circumstances, we set aside [Gobi’s] conviction on the capital charge. We highlight the coming together of three circumstances that have led to this outcome:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the nature of the case that was run by the Prosecution at the trial;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the different case that the Prosecution ran on appeal, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a difference that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">has to be said was not pointed out by the Defence</span> in the course of the appeal and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that was likely not thought to be material by either the Prosecution or the Defence at the time, given the prevailing legal position at that time</span>; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  the change in the legal position in respect of the doctrine of wilful blindness <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that was </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">effected by this court in Adili after [Gobi (Appeal)] was decided, and that we have, in this criminal motion, decided should apply to the interplay between the s 18(2) presumption and the doctrine of wilful blindness</span> and, specifically, the question of the Applicant’s knowledge of the nature of the Drugs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 It is likely that if any of these three circumstances had been absent, the outcome in this criminal motion might well have been different.

This was not, as the DT deemed it, a case of the Prosecution failing to “strictly and scrupulously [observe] its role, functions and duties”.

Put in the context of the present inquiry, therefore, a proper appreciation of the <span class="font-italic">exceptional</span> circumstances that led to the Court of Appeal’s finding that the Prosecution’s change of case was prejudicial to Gobi was <span class="font-italic">just as </span><span class="font-italic">important</span> as the finding itself. It is also important to correctly understand the Court of Appeal’s finding that Gobi had been “prejudiced”. This inquiry was directed at whether the Prosecution’s change of case could be material to the outcome of the case: see <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review) </span>at [117]–[120]. This was a necessary part of the inquiry because the review power can only be exercised where it is shown not only that the relevant ground (such as new material or a change of the law) is made out, but that this could have a material bearing on the outcome of the case. It was upon these premises that the DT’s search for a rational basis should have begun. Placing a narrow focus on the Court of Appeal’s finding that the Prosecution’s change of case had caused prejudice to Gobi, without due regard for the full ambit of the Court of Appeal’s observations in their proper context, puts one in jeopardy of missing the forest for the trees. This would, at the same time, facilitate an unduly innocuous view of Mr Ravi’s Interview Statements (which the DT appears to us to have taken). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Second, when the First to Third Interview Statements are set against this understanding of the Prosecution’s conduct in the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings, it is our view that there was <span class="font-italic">no rational basis</span> for Mr Ravi to have made them. We consider each of the Interview Statements in turn, beginning with the Second Interview Statement.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Second Interview Statement contained the allegation that the Public Prosecutor was “overzealous in his prosecution and that has led to the death sentence of Gobi”. Preliminarily, we address the DT’s determination that the word “overzealous” “did not inherently carry or imply any negative or offensive connotation”. With respect, we cannot see how this could be. The prefix “over”, especially when applied to the word “zealous” which in itself connotes a sense of an energetic and enthusiastic pursuit of a cause or objective, plainly suggests an <span class="font-italic">excessive</span>, perhaps even unrestrained, sense of enthusiasm. When employed in relation to the Prosecution’s core function in the institution and conduct of criminal proceedings against accused persons, this plainly connotes an improper exercise of prosecutorial power and cannot reasonably be viewed as innocuous. And the crux of the allegation in the Second Interview Statement was something even more sinister; it was that this improper zeal had “<span class="font-italic">led to the death</span><span class="font-italic"> sentence</span>” imposed on Gobi [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Second Interview Statement also has to be understood in the context of the wider point that Mr Ravi was making. We note the comments made by Mr Ravi that prefaced the Second Interview Statement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a defence counsel, I only have a role towards my client. <span class="font-italic">But the Prosecution in prosecuting people, especially for death penalty, it is extremely important that you must be fair to both sides, the accused, and the State</span>. So therefore, balancing this, the State has been overzealous in his prosecution, the Public Prosecutor has been overzealous in his prosecution and that has led to the death sentence of Gobi. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 What is apparent from this is that Mr Ravi was not only alleging that the Prosecution had been excessively enthusiastic in the conduct of the criminal proceedings involving Gobi, but in doing so had been <span class="font-italic">unfair</span> to Gobi, potentially to his fatal detriment. It is difficult to see, then, how describing the Prosecution’s conduct of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings as “overzealous” could be anything <span class="font-italic">but</span> negative, let alone a description that was merely neutral. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 When this understanding of the Second Interview Statement is juxtaposed against the true nature of the conduct of the Prosecution’s case (as explained at [62] above), there can be no doubt that the Second Interview Statement was wholly without basis. Nothing in the Brief Grounds or the Prosecution’s conduct in the course of the Gobi proceedings lends credence to Mr Ravi’s allegation that the Prosecution had acted <span class="font-italic">unfair</span><span class="font-italic">ly</span> towards Gobi in light of the prevailing legal position at the relevant time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The same is true of the First and Third Interview Statements, which essentially consist of allegations that the change of the Prosecution’s case noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span> called into question the “fairness of the administration of justice … by the Prosecution”, and that “the fairness of the Prosecution [was] called into question by the Court itself”. Again, it is difficult to see how these statements could be premised on a rational basis in light of our observations at [62] above on the state of the law at the relevant time. It was not accurate for Mr Ravi to say that the Court of Appeal had called into question the fairness of the Prosecution; nor was any question raised as to the Prosecution’s administration of justice because the conduct of Gobi’s prosecution had been premised on the pre-<span class="font-italic">Adili</span> understanding of s 18(1) of the MDA, which at the time also extended to the s 18(2) MDA presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The third and final observation we make is that Mr Ravi, in making the First to Third Interview Statements, had conveyed that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> had acted improperly in the conduct of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings. In this connection, we respectfully disagree with the DT’s view that Mr Ravi had “never said anywhere or<span class="font-italic"> made the imputation</span> that the AGC had acted in bad faith, maliciously or improperly” [emphasis added]. Mr Ravi’s intention in this regard may be understood with reference to both an objective interpretation of these statements and his own subjective account of his motivations, viewed in the context of his surrounding conduct at the time these statements were made. The starting point here was to consider what Mr Ravi <span class="font-italic">meant </span>when he made the First to Third Interview Statements. On a plain reading of these statements, as we have canvassed at [64]–[68] above, the First to Third Interview Statements imputed that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>had <span class="font-italic">unfairly</span> conducted the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings in a manner that constituted a breach of the fairness of the administration of justice by the Prosecution. In our view, such an imputation clearly suggested that the Prosecution had acted improperly. To the extent that the DT did not take the same view, it may have well been due to the “neutral” interpretation it had placed on words such as “overzealous” in the First to Third Interview Statements. Mr Ravi, in fact, confirmed in cross-examination before the DT that he had sought to highlight this alleged “breach of … fairness” by the Prosecution:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Okay, so you were not trying to imply that the public prosecutor was acting in [bad] faith or maliciously, yes? </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Mr Ravi]: … I was saying that the public prosecutor was a wrongdoer to the extent that they have conduct the---the---they---the---there <span class="font-italic">was a breach of their fairness in terms of they are ministers of justice and administration of justice </span>in the context of running a different case<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Given that Mr Ravi had invoked the paramount duty of the Prosecution and its officers as “ministers of justice”, we cannot see how the alleged <span class="font-italic">breach</span> of that duty could be characterised as not improper. In our view, Mr Ravi’s subsequent conduct in making the Facebook Statements (which, amongst other things, alleged that the Prosecution were “wrongdoers”), and his further act of commencing legal proceedings in Suit 1068 which claimed that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> had committed the tort of <span class="font-italic">misfeasance </span><span class="font-italic">in public office,</span> and which we will return to later in this judgment, reinforces the inference that Mr Ravi intended to convey impropriety by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In light of the foregoing observations, we consider that the DT erred in its interpretation of the First to Third Interview Statements. Indeed, when the full extent of the Court of Appeal’s comments in its Brief Grounds is considered, the allegations contained in the First to Third Interview Statements are devoid of any reasonable basis. Mr Ravi essentially sought to cast the impression that the Prosecution had “<span class="font-italic">overzealous[</span><span class="font-italic">ly]</span>” and <span class="font-italic">unfairly</span> changed its case in order to secure Gobi’s conviction of a capital charge potentially leading to his <span class="font-italic">death</span>, and he then attempted to shore up this assertion by erroneously stating that the “Court itself” shared similar misgivings regarding the Prosecution’s conduct. That was untrue as is evident even from the extracts of <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span> and the Brief Grounds that we have referred to above. Plainly, Mr Ravi intended to convey impropriety on the part of the Public Prosecutor, and these allegations, which rested on false premises, were gravely irresponsible and wholly improper. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In that light, it is apt also to touch on the Judge’s decision in <span class="font-italic">AG v Ravi</span>. The Judge agreed with the DT’s decision on the First Charge and found that Mr Ravi had a rational basis for making the Facebook Statements: see <span class="font-italic">AG v Ravi </span>at [46]. Unlike the DT, and in fairness to the Judge, the Judge had at [44] of <span class="font-italic">AG </span><span class="font-italic">v Ravi </span>expressly considered the observations of the Court of Appeal in the Brief<span class="font-italic"> </span>Grounds and <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span> (see <span class="font-italic">AG v Ravi </span>at [110] and [113]) regarding the conduct of the Prosecution in light of the legal position at the time. He reasoned, however, that (<span class="font-italic">AG v Ravi </span>at [44]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n my view, the first defendant’s Interview Statements hinged on the Court of Appeal having specifically highlighted two matters in the [Brief Grounds]: first, the Prosecution’s change in its stance on appeal, and second the resulting prejudice to Gobi. The former was an objective fact. The latter was also factual in that the Court of Appeal had expressly articulated its concern that prejudice <span class="font-italic">was</span> caused to Gobi by the Prosecution’s change in stance, and this was so irrespective of whether the Prosecution had reasonable justification for how it ran its case on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 With respect, we are unable to agree with the Judge’s reasoning. It follows from our observations regarding the <span class="font-italic">true import</span> of the First to Third Interview Statements that Mr Ravi was not merely stating <span class="font-italic">objective facts</span> regarding the conduct of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>proceedings but had gone further to call the “fairness” of the Prosecution’s conduct into question. The First to Third Interview Statements carried an imputation of wrongdoing which implicated the <span class="font-italic">propriety</span> with which the Prosecution had conducted its case (namely, by suggesting a deliberate, “overzealous” and unfair pursuit of the death penalty against Gobi), rather than factual statements regarding the <span class="font-italic">result</span> that prejudice was caused. Contrary to the Judge’s observations (and as we have highlighted at [62] above), because of the imputation of wrongdoing on the part of the Prosecution, whether the Prosecution had a “reasonable justification for how it ran its case on appeal” was of direct relevance to whether these statements were made on a rational basis. As previously explained, in our judgment, they were not so made because the change of case was not something that anyone, including the Prosecution seemed to have thought was legally material at the relevant time, and which Mr Ravi <span class="font-italic">himself</span> thought was not material even after the Court of Appeal had raised the issue when hearing <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>. Further, the Court of Appeal’s observations as to prejudice were not directed at suggesting any such impropriety on the part of the Prosecution but solely at the potential materiality of this change of case given that the Prosecution had run its case at trial on a certain basis. If the Prosecution was held to that case, then in the light of the development of the law after <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, it would not be able to rely on the presumption under s 18(2) once the point was decided in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 To conclude this section of the judgment, we reiterate that the First Charge is not in issue, and that we therefore do not base our findings on due cause on this. But the point of the foregoing analysis on the First Charge is to demonstrate the fact that an assessment of the gravity of Mr Ravi’s misconduct <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be undertaken properly without a granular examination of the context in which they were made. This includes, in particular, the various turns in the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings. It would be artificial to ignore Mr Ravi’s conduct which forms the subject of the First Charge in considering the other charges against him, which involve statements of a similar nature made by Mr Ravi in the same series of events. We return to this theme later in our judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 With the foregoing in mind, we turn to consider what the gravamen of Mr Ravi’s misconduct in relation to the Second to Fourth Charges was. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Second Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Second Charge pertained to Mr Ravi’s First and Second Facebook Statements. These are set out in full at [21] above and are set out again below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span><span class="font-weight-bold">The First Facebook Statement</span>: “… these government lawyers who handled the Gobi’s case are the wrongdoers.”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span><span class="font-weight-bold">The Second Facebook Statement</span>: “I have already taken instructions from Gobi and his family to commence proceedings against [the AG], [the DAG], Mr Faizal SC in court. I will file the writ of summons in the next few days for both personally against all 3 of the above Government lawyers and also against their offices in which they hold public appointment. They have to be accountable to Gobi and his family in court and be subject to rigorous cross-examination and public scrutiny of their conduct of Gobi’s case …”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">By these statements, Mr Ravi is charged with having made “a baseless accusation of misconduct and/or a threat to commence legal proceedings” against his fellow legal practitioners, which amounted to improper conduct under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA read with r 7(2) of the PCR. Rule 7(2) of the PCR provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Responsibilities of legal practitioners to each other</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">7.</span>— … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) A legal practitioner must treat other legal practitioners with courtesy and fairness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Put simply, the key inquiry in the Second Charge is whether Mr Ravi’s failure to treat his fellow legal practitioners (in this case, the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>) with courtesy and fairness was of such a degree of seriousness as to amount to due cause. The DT found that no serious misconduct arose from the First Facebook Statement. This was ostensibly because the DT found that Mr Ravi had, in referring to the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>as wrongdoers, intended to imply a <span class="font-italic">civil</span> wrong as there was “no reference to any criminal proceedings or the prospect/possibility thereof”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In our view, and with respect, the DT missed the mark in focussing its analysis on the distinction between a civil and criminal wrong. As we have highlighted at [74] above, the real gravamen of the misconduct here had to be assessed in relation to all the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the statements and the target of the allegations made therein, rather than be confined to the binary question of whether the wrong alleged was civil or criminal in nature. Such a distinction is tangential to the issue of whether Mr Ravi had acted in fairness and courtesy toward the AG <span class="font-italic">et </span><span class="font-italic">al </span>as fellow legal practitioners. The essence of the inquiry centres on understanding what Mr Ravi meant when he labelled the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> as “wrongdoers”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 That, in turn, is informed by reference to several contextual sources. We begin with Mr Ravi’s Interview Statements, which were made one day prior to the Facebook Statements. These, due to their proximity in time, are relevant to any attempt to understand the essence of Mr Ravi’s allegation of wrongdoing on the part of the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>. It will be recalled that Mr Ravi’s Interview Statements contained the allegation that the AG, as Public Prosecutor, was “overzealous in his prosecution” having conducted it in a manner which “call[ed into question] the fairness of the administration of justice in Gobi’s case by the Prosecution”, “[leading] to the death sentence of [Gobi].” Put in Mr Ravi’s words, the “wrongdoing” referred to the alleged “breach of [the Prosecution’s duty of] fairness [as] ministers of justice and [the] administration of justice”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Beyond this, the full sting of the alleged “civil wrong” is best articulated in the statement of claim filed by Mr Ravi when he made good on his declaration to commence an action against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> in Suit 1068 (the “Statement of Claim”). Suit 1068 was commenced on 4 November 2020, less than two weeks after the release of the Brief Grounds. We note that on the same day, Mr Ravi posted the Statement of Claim on Facebook with a comment that the suit was based on an alleged abuse of power or other breach of duty. In his Statement of Claim, Mr Ravi (on behalf of Gobi) alleged that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> were liable for the tort of misfeasance in public office for “abus[ing] their powers and act[ing] in bad faith by improperly performing a legal act which resulted in harm to [Gobi]”. This alleged breach was particularised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34. By running a different case as between the Plaintiff’s trial and the Prosecution’s appeal in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>], the [AG <span class="font-italic">et</span> <span class="font-italic">al</span>] were <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">dishonest</span> and behaved in a manner unbefitting of a legal practitioner’s professional standing which is contrary to the public interest with substantial prejudice to the fairness of [Gobi’s] trial.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35. Through the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">deplorable</span> conduct, the [AG <span class="font-italic">et</span> <span class="font-italic">al</span>] had <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">taken unfair advantage</span> of [Gobi] by <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">misleading</span> the CA as to its case on appeal, leading the CA to overturn [Gobi’s] acquittal and sentence him to death in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>]…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36. By running a different case as between [Gobi’s] trial and the Prosecution’s appeal in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>], the [AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>] have <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">failed to act honourably</span><span class="font-italic"> in their duties to assist in the administration of justice</span>. Through such conduct, <span class="font-italic">the prosecutorial process did not maintain fairness, integrity and efficiency</span> which is contrary to [Gobi’s] right to due process …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 When these paragraphs of the Statement of Claim were brought to Mr Ravi’s attention during the hearing before us, he explained that he had described the conduct of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings as “dishonest” in light of the Prosecution’s alleged failure to apply to set aside Gobi’s conviction in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal) </span>despite the Court of Appeal having raised the issue of a change of case in the Registry Letter (see [59(e)]–[59(f)]). Mr Ravi also sought, in an e-mail sent to the Supreme Court Registry on 9 February 2023, to furnish another explanation for the use of the term “dishonest” (the “9 February e-mail”), even though no leave had been sought by Mr Ravi to make these further submissions. Mr Ravi averred that the allegation of dishonesty had to be seen in the light of the conduct of the state counsel in charge of OS 111. It transpired that during the course of the proceedings in OS 111, the AGC had requested and received from the Singapore Prison Service (“SPS”) the appellants’ correspondence with their lawyers and families (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal </span>[2020] 2 SLR 883). Mr Ravi stated in the 9 February e-mail that the “AGC was dishonest” in the course of those proceedings when the state counsel involved denied that the SPS had forwarded the correspondence in issue, when “in fact, there were multiple disclosures for multiple prisoners, the true scale of which is unknown”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Leaving aside the procedural impropriety of the 9 February e-mail, these arguments are without merit. It is apparent from the language of paragraph 34 of the Statement of Claim that the term “dishonest” was not directed at any alleged failure of the Prosecution to discontinue the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings. Further, the issue in OS 111 of the appellants’ correspondence was not even faintly alluded to in paragraph 34, or for that matter, anywhere else in the Statement of Claim. Instead, it is clear that the allegation of dishonesty was made in relation to the “<span class="font-italic">running of a different case as between </span><span class="font-italic">[Gobi’s] trial and the Prosecution’s appeal in </span>[CCA 20]” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Returning to the inquiry at hand, which is what Mr Ravi was referring to when he labelled the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> as “wrongdoers”, in our judgment, it is apparent from paragraphs 34 to 36 of the Statement of Claim that Mr Ravi was not merely stating the fact that the Prosecution had run a different case at trial and on appeal and that this had been prejudicial to Gobi. Rather, Mr Ravi had gone much further to allege that the Prosecution had chosen to conduct the Gobi proceedings in a “dishonest”, “deplorable” and dishonourable manner that “[took] unfair advantage” of Mr Ravi’s client and misled the court, leading to the imposition of the sentence of death on Gobi. The First Facebook Statement must be read in this light, because in Mr Ravi’s view, it was this grave and intentional abuse of prosecutorial powers that warranted his public call in his Second Facebook Statement for the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> to be “accountable to Gobi and his family in court and … subject to rigorous cross-examination and public scrutiny of their conduct of Gobi’s case”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In our judgment, quite apart from whether this referred to a transgression of a civil or criminal nature, the allegation of “wrongdoing” in the First Facebook Statement, in substance, constituted a <span class="font-italic">serious accusation</span> against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>. The AG holds an essential role in our legal system, having been accorded the power “to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence” by Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (2020 Rev Ed). This is mirrored in s 10 of the CPC, which states that the AG, as the Public Prosecutor, “has the control and direction of criminal prosecutions”. The central place that the AG, as the Public Prosecutor, has in the administration of justice is underscored by the <span class="font-italic">status</span> accorded to the prosecutorial function, which is subject only to the constitutional power of the court to prevent the prosecutorial power from being exercised unconstitutionally: see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Guat Neo Phyllis </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 239 at [144]. To similar effect, this court observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Gopalan Nair</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 969 (“<span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span>”) at [48], that “[t]he office of the AG, like that of a judge, is an essential pillar of our legal system and no advocate and solicitor should be allowed to undermine the integrity of that office”<span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 When these weighty considerations are set against the nature of the allegation made in the First Facebook Statement, which is that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>had set out to do wrong in the “fairness of the administration of justice in Gobi’s case” in a manner that “led to the death<span class="font-italic"> </span>sentence of Gobi”, it is difficult to conceive of a more serious attack against the office of the AG. The allegation of wrongdoing cuts <span class="font-italic">right </span><span class="font-italic">to the heart of the AG’s role </span>and suggested serious impropriety and the dereliction of his duty in the fair administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The gravity of Mr Ravi’s misconduct in the Second Charge also had to be assessed against the procedural history of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>proceedings. We return here to the point we made at [71] of this judgment, that an in-depth understanding of the relevant events is necessary in order to grasp the <span class="font-italic">full</span> <span class="font-italic">pith</span> of Mr Ravi’s misconduct. While we do not propose to rehearse the matters set out at [59(a)]–[59(h)], we do reiterate two pertinent observations that were made in the Brief Grounds. First, the Court of Appeal, referring to those representing Gobi, highlighted at [9] of the Brief Grounds that “[t]his issue [of a change of case] <span class="font-italic">was not raised</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (</span><span class="font-italic">Appeal)</span>] or in the initial submissions [in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>]” [emphasis added], but instead was raised for the first time <span class="font-italic">on the Court</span><span class="font-italic"> of Appeal’s own motion</span> in the Registry Letter. Second, and relatedly, the Court of Appeal explicitly considered at [19] of the Brief Grounds that the parties <span class="font-italic">did not </span>have the benefit of the guidance in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at the time of trial and contemplated that the Prosecution’s case might have been formulated on the premise that the doctrine of wilful blindness <span class="font-italic">was</span> relevant in considering whether the s 18(2) presumption had been rebutted. The Court of Appeal at [23] of the Brief Grounds also emphasised that its decision came in the light of particular circumstances in the course of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>proceedings, one of which was “the different case that the Prosecution ran on appeal, <span class="font-italic">a difference that</span><span class="font-italic"> … was likely not thought to be material by either the Prosecution or the Defence at the time, given the prevailing legal position at that time</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Linking these points to the allegations that form the subject of the Second Charge, two further points arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 First, <span class="font-italic">nothing</span> in the Brief Grounds provided Mr Ravi with a reasonable basis to allege serious “wrongdo[ing]” on the part of the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as he had done in the First Facebook Statement. We reiterate here that while the Court of Appeal did observe in its Brief Grounds at [20] that the Prosecution’s change of case had caused prejudice to Gobi, it <span class="font-italic">did not</span> conclude that the Prosecution had done this deliberately. Conversely, it expressly clarified that no party to the proceedings could have appreciated the distinction in the Prosecution’s cases at trial and on appeal because of the prevailing legal position at the time. This indeed was why the point was not picked up by any of those involved in <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span><span class="font-italic">(Appeal) </span>– neither the Prosecution, the Defence, nor even the court. The consequent prejudice – in the sense that this gave rise to a course that could have a material bearing on the accused person – was, as noted by the Court of Appeal, a result of a confluence of unique circumstances, as well as the evolution and clarification of the legal position following <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>. Therefore, when the allegation of “wrongdo[ing]” in the First Facebook Statement (made the very day following the delivery of the Brief Grounds) is set against this backdrop, it becomes clear that the First Facebook Statement was made <span class="font-italic">wholly without </span><span class="font-italic">basis</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Second, Mr Ravi, <span class="font-italic">at the least, ought to have known</span> of the seriousness of the allegations made in the First and Second Facebook Statements, and that any suggestion of impropriety on the Prosecution’s part lacked basis in light of the Court of Appeal’s Brief Grounds. While Mr Ravi denied any knowledge of the falsehood of these statements in his Reply Letter, we take the view that he ought to have known this not merely because he is an experienced lawyer of around 20 years’ standing, but also because he had represented Gobi <span class="font-italic">throughout</span> the review proceedings and was present when the Court of Appeal delivered its Brief Grounds. To have proceeded to make the accusations that he did in the First and Second Facebook Statements despite this, in our view, indicates that Mr Ravi did so at least recklessly (if not deliberately), without due regard for the importance of communicating the true state of affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 To summarise our findings on the Second Charge thus far, the gravamen of the misconduct here is that by making the First Facebook Statement, Mr Ravi recklessly levied a <span class="font-italic">gr</span><span class="font-italic">ave yet baseless</span> accusation that the Prosecution had chosen to conduct the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings in a “dishonest” and “deplorable” manner that “[took] unfair advantage” of Gobi and misled the court, causing the sentence of death to be wrongly imposed on Gobi. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In our judgment, the misconduct disclosed in the Second Charge constituted a serious breach of r 7(2) of the PCR. The First Facebook Statement could not be described as courteous or fair in any conceivable sense of these terms.<span style="color: rgba(54,95,145,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">particular severity of Mr Ravi’s misconduct in this case, given the targets of his statements, may be highlighted with reference to the principles in r 7(1) of the PCR, which guide the interpretation of r 7(2). In particular, r 7(1) states that “[a] legal practitioner must not deal with another legal practitioner in any manner that may adversely affect </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the reputation and good standing of the legal profession or the practice of law in Singapore</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">” [emphasis added]. In the “paradigm” case where one legal practitioner treats another discourteously or unfairly, that </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">in itself may affect the reputation and standing of the legal profession as an honourable profession. Where, however, the legal practitioner in question is a </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">constitutional office-holder </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">as is the case with the AG), and the precise </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">form </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">taken by the discourtesy or unfairness involves a fundamental attack on the discharge of that constitutional role, the damage to the reputation and standing of the legal profession is particularly severe</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">: see at [83] above. The manner in which the First Facebook Statement attacked the AG </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">et al</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">seriously undermined not only the good standing of the legal profession, but more broadly, the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">integrity</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> of the </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">legal system as a whole.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 We add here that the extent of unfairness and discourtesy shown by Mr Ravi in advancing a baseless allegation against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> is <span class="font-italic">further amplified</span> when one considers the potential public reach of Mr Ravi’s First and Second Facebook Statements. As the Law Society highlights in its submissions, the various Facebook posts that are material to these proceedings were posted on Mr Ravi’s Facebook account, which was accessible to the public and had a sizeable following of <span class="font-italic">over 32,400 followers</span>. Undoubtedly, the widespread circulation of an allegation of the nature set out above enhanced the risk that the integrity of the AG would be undermined in the eyes of the public. Thus, the unfairness and discourtesy here was of such a degree as to threaten to erode the public’s trust in a key legal institution of Singapore not merely by virtue of its <span class="font-italic">content</span>, but also its <span class="font-italic">potentially</span> <span class="font-italic">far-reaching circulation</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In this light, we address Mr Ravi’s submission that “cause lawyering” justified his decision to make the various Facebook posts that are material to the present proceedings. Mr Ravi’s argument here, as we understand it, is that the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the case (being one that involved the potential imposition of capital punishment) was such that it necessitated public discussion. Indeed, Mr Ravi, making reference to Jothie Rajah and Arun K Thiruvengadam, “Of Absences, Masks, and Exceptions: Cause Lawyering in Singapore”<span class="font-italic"> </span>(2013) 31 (3) Wisconsin International Law Journal 646 (“<span class="font-italic">Cause Lawyering in Singapore</span>”), explained his submission as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Ravi: Yes. The cause lawyering article, I thought, would be useful because, Your Honour, judicial execution, and---and---and executions are important matters. They’re not property matters. They’re not arbitration matters. They’re not company matters. This is a human life. And the state, when it executes, it executes on behalf of its citizens. Judicial executions also will---will---will apply the same way because of the powers that has been given to the Judges. <span class="font-italic">What I’m saying is that---that it should not be a private matter when there’s a miscarriage of justice has taken place when the AG, after all that has transpired, have issued all those letters.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In our judgment, this submission is wrong and in no way mitigates the seriousness of Mr Ravi’s misconduct. We cannot see how the “cause” at hand, no matter its public sensitivity or significance, necessitated (let alone justified) the publication of <span class="font-italic">unfair</span><span class="font-italic">, baseless, discourteous and damaging </span>statements. While the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings were undoubtedly a matter of public interest given the nature of the legal issues at hand and, more importantly, the fact that a life was at stake, this <span class="font-italic">did not</span> give Mr Ravi a license to publicly levy accusations of wrongdoing against the AG <span class="font-italic">et</span><span class="font-italic"> al</span> without basis. For completeness, nothing in <span class="font-italic">Cause Lawyering in Singapore </span>suggests otherwise (nor was the professional conduct of legal practitioners in Singapore discussed there).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Before we conclude our findings on the Second Charge, we turn to consider Mr Ravi’s submission that the case authorities involving breaches of r 7(2) of the PCR generally have not been found to disclose due cause. However, only one authority cited by Mr Ravi – namely, <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Terence Tan Bian Chye</span> [2007] SGDC 10 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Tan</span>”) – involved discourtesy between legal practitioners. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">Terence Tan</span>, the respondent was a practitioner of about 15 years’ standing who represented his client in a High Court suit. In the course of those proceedings, the respondent wrote several offensive and threatening letters to his opposing counsel and various related parties to the suit. In particular, his letter to his opposing counsel contained the allegation that the opposing counsel was misleading the court. While this was found to have breached the equivalent of r 7(2) of the PCR, the disciplinary committee found that due cause was not shown and recommended a monetary penalty of $3,000 for this particular act (amongst other monetary penalties for the letters he had sent to the related parties to the suit). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Mr Ravi also relied on an excerpt in Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Ethics and Professional Responsibility: A Code for the Advocate and Solicitor </span>(Academy Publishing, 2007) (“<span class="font-italic">Ethics and Professional Responsibility</span>”) at paragraph 25-066 to illustrate that such cases often only attracted fines. This excerpt listed cases involving “offensive behaviour” between legal practitioners, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In December 1993, an advocate and solicitor was fined $250 for using threatening language against a legal officer of the HDB. In September 1993, an advocate and solicitor was fined $1,000 for threatening a court interpreter. In November 1994, December 1996 and February 2001, certain advocates and solicitors were fined $100, $1,500 and $5000 respectively for being offensive to public prosecutors. In February 1995, an advocate and solicitor was fined $2000 for writing a letter in threatening terms. In February 2000, an advocate and solicitor was fined $1000 for making offensive remarks about the President of the Shariah Court in a written submission. In July 2000, an advocate and solicitor was fined $1000 for disrespectful conduct towards the Commissioner of Labour (which included the allegation that the Commissioner was biased) …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In our view, these authorities do not assist Mr Ravi. The misconduct in the case before us, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Terence Tan</span>, was not a mere instance of emotions spilling over between counsel on opposing sides, resulting in the exchange of harsh words. Nor was this simply one example in the litany of cases on rude behaviour cited in the excerpt from <span class="font-italic">Ethics and Professional Responsibility </span>set out<span class="font-italic"> </span>above. Instead, as we have noted at [83], the nature and sting of the discourtesy and unfairness that were encapsulated in the First and Second Facebook Statements, when these are correctly understood,<span class="font-italic"> </span>was an affront to an <span class="font-italic">essential </span><span class="font-italic">pillar of our legal system</span> with reckless disregard for the truth. The failure here went far beyond the realm of impoliteness and was an attack on the administration of criminal justice. This cannot be lightly countenanced, nor waved away with a slap on the wrist.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Therefore, in our judgment, due cause is amply established when the proper gravamen of the Second Charge is appreciated. We turn next to consider the gravamen of the Third Charge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Third Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Third Charge concerned Mr Ravi’s declaration in the Third Facebook Statement that he would “commence proceedings against law society [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] if it does not do its part to protect lawyers and their independence of the profession if it entertains any further complaints or partcipates [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in any harassment by AG to harass [him] in doing [his] job.” In so doing, Mr Ravi was charged with issuing “a threat to commence legal proceedings against the Law Society and/or a baseless insinuation that the Law Society misus[ed] its statutory powers” and was thereby guilty of improper conduct pursuant to s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA read with r 8(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PCR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The DT found that the Third Facebook Statement constituted a baseless accusation against the Law Society, because, contrary to what the Third Facebook Statement suggested, the Law Society did not have the discretion <span class="font-italic">not </span>to act on the DAG’s Complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 We agree with the DT. The substance of the allegation in the Third Facebook Statement was that, in “entertain[ing]” or, in other words, acting on the DAG’s Complaint, the Law Society was “participat[ing] ... in ... harassment by [the] AG” against Mr Ravi in “doing [his] job” and thereby was failing to “protect lawyers and the independence of the profession”. This implicitly suggested that the Law Society <span class="font-italic">chose</span> to act on the DAG’s Complaint, which was simply <span class="font-italic">not the case</span>. Section 85 of the LPA sets out the statutory scheme for the consideration of complaints against regulated legal practitioners. In the ordinary case, where the formal requirements of s 85(1) are fulfilled, the Council of the Law Society must refer every complaint to the Chairperson of the Inquiry Panel: see s 85(1A) of the LPA. In turn, the Chairperson of the Inquiry Panel must constitute a Review Committee (see s 85(6) of the LPA), which in turn will either refer the matter back to the Chairperson or direct the Council to dismiss the matter (see s 85(8) of the LPA). Should the Review Committee refer the matter to the Chairperson, the Chairperson is to constitute an Inquiry Committee (see s 85(10) of the LPA). The Inquiry Committee is to consider, amongst other matters, whether a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal is required (see s 86(7) of the LPA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As we recently observed in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon, Zero Geraldo Mario </span>[2022] 3 SLR 1386 (“<span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>”) at [29], however, unlike the position under s 85(1) of the LPA, “[s] 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA … confers on a very select group of office holders a power of a relatively exceptional nature by granting their complaints special weight, according them a statutory ‘shortcut’ that bypasses the usual procedure of an inquiry by an Inquiry Committee before a complaint can come before a Disciplinary Tribunal”. As the AG fell within this “select group”, the DAG’s Complaint could be and was referred to the Law Society under the statutory “shortcut” under s 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). This, as a matter of statutory design, <span class="font-italic">mandated</span> the Law Society to apply for a disciplinary tribunal to be appointed. In so far as the Third Facebook Statement contained any insinuation suggesting that the Law Society could choose not to act in this way and would be acting improperly if it did apply for the appointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal, it was wholly without basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 We do agree with the Law Society that Mr Ravi <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that the Law Society was statutorily required to act on the complaints referred to by the AG. In this regard, Mr Ravi’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief contained his acknowledgment that the Law Society was “statutory [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] obliged to take the steps under s 85(3) of the LPA upon receipt of complaints from the AGC”. Mr Ravi also acknowledged his awareness of the same during the hearing before us. His main arguments on the Third Charge were, instead, centred on how the statutory framework under s 85 of the LPA was “imbalanced” in favour of the AG, therefore constituting a breach of natural justice. In this regard, Mr Ravi explained that this was why he had made the Third Facebook Statement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Mr Ravi]: [Section 85(3) of the LPA] undermines the administration of justice to the extent that lawyers have to be---<span class="font-italic">always have this sword of Damocles hang---dangling with---on their---over their head with these pre-emptive powers given to the Attorney-General to refer a complaint to the DT directly</span>, bypassing even the Inquiry Committee, Your Honour.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Menon, CJ: And <span class="font-italic">that is why you issued that statement against the Law Society</span>?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Mr Ravi]: <span class="font-italic">Yes, Your Honour</span>. And also generally, this is also the view of many members of the criminal bar.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 These arguments, in our view, do little to justify the baseless attack by Mr Ravi directed at the Law Society’s execution of its core functions. Conversely, they reinforce the view that Mr Ravi, in making the Third Facebook Statement, had <span class="font-italic">known of </span>the true state of affairs and the Law Society’s statutory obligations, but, <span class="font-italic">in spite of this,</span> <span class="font-italic">chose</span> to impute impropriety to the Law Society for doing nothing more than carrying out those statutory obligations, in order to ventilate the unfairness he perceived in the legislative scheme. This suggested to us that Mr Ravi made the Third Facebook Statement with, at the very least, a <span class="font-italic">reckless disregard </span>for the truth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 We turn our focus to the latter portion of the Third Facebook Statement, which is<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the Law Society would be “<span class="font-italic">participat</span><span class="font-italic">[ing]…</span>in <span class="font-italic">harassment</span>” by the AG [emphasis added]. In this regard, the Third Facebook Statement appears to insinuate that if the Law Society was to act on the DAG’s Complaint, it would be part of a <span class="font-italic">wilful </span>effort to harass Mr Ravi’s attempts to “[do his] job”. This premise was tied to one of the core purposes of the Law Society (which is to “protect lawyers and the independence of the profession”: see s 38(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the LPA). The Third Facebook Statement, therefore, not only gave the erroneous impression that the Law Society could in its discretion have decided not to refer the DAG's Complaint to the DT, but also intimated that the Law Society would <span class="font-italic">deliberately </span><span class="font-italic">be acting improperly and contrary to its own purposes,</span> even to the extent of abdicating its own duties to the legal profession if it acted upon the said complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 This, in our judgment, constituted a serious breach of r 8(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PCR, which provides that “[a] legal practitioner must not act towards any person in a way which is fraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to the legal practitioner’s position as a member of an honourable profession”. Attacking the very statutory body charged with the regulation of the profession is wholly inconsistent with such notions of honour. The misconduct in the Third Charge, therefore, is of sufficient seriousness and gives rise to due cause.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Fourth Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Fourth Charge is that Mr Ravi acted improperly within the meaning of s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the LPA read with r 7(2) of the PCR in sending the Reply Letter and threatening to commence legal proceedings against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>therein. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Neither party seriously contended that the Fourth Charge disclosed due cause in and of itself. That said, the <span class="font-italic">facts</span> that ground the Fourth Charge cannot be viewed in isolation. They form part of the “totality of the facts and circumstances” in the light of which the court ought to assess whether Mr Ravi’s misconduct is sufficiently serious. On this score, Mr Ravi’s Reply Letter, accompanied by his subsequent act of publicly announcing his “strict instructions to commence proceedings” against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> in his Second Facebook Post, had the effect of <span class="font-italic">strengthen</span><span class="font-italic">ing</span> our interpretation regarding the entire course of Mr Ravi’s conduct as one that persistently insinuated or alleged impropriety on the part of the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>. This therefore buttresses our finding that due cause is made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on due cause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In the round, we find that due cause has been shown in respect of Mr Ravi’s misconduct giving rise to the Second to Fourth Charges, taken as a whole. Mr Ravi accused the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> of having improperly and unfairly pursued the prosecution of Gobi at the potential cost of his life. He then went on to suggest falsely that, should the Law Society act on the DAG’s Complaint, it would be committing a deliberate act of impropriety (even to the extent of abdicating its statutorily accorded duties to the legal profession). The character and import of these allegations were such as to pose a real threat of serious injury to public confidence in the cornerstones of our legal system. This was not simply because of the manner in which these allegations struck at the core functions of the AG and the Law Society respectively, but also because they were untruthful and published to a potentially wide audience. There can be no understating the seriousness of such infractions, nor any doubt that it warrants that Mr Ravi be dealt with under s 83(1) of the LPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sanction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Having found that due cause is established, we turn to consider the appropriate sanction to be imposed on Mr Ravi. In this regard, s 83(1) of the LPA provides for a range of penalties:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power to strike off roll, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">83.</span> —(1) All advocates and solicitors are subject to the control of the Supreme Court and shall be liable on due cause shown —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to be struck off the roll;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to be suspended from practice for a period not exceeding 5 years;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to pay a penalty of not more than $100,000;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) to be censured; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) to suffer the punishment referred to in paragraph (c) in addition to the punishment referred to in paragraph (b) or (d).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Counsel for the Law Society, Ms Lin, initially took the position that a suspension of three months would be appropriate. When our recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span> was brought to Ms Lin’s attention during the hearing, she revised her position on the appropriate sentence. In <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>, due cause was found against the respondent on two charges: first, of having committed <span class="font-italic">sub</span><span class="font-italic"> judice</span> contempt of court by publicly commenting on ongoing court proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55]); and second, of non-compliance with a costs order, accompanied by acts taken with the aim of garnering public support for that non-compliance (which included the publication on Facebook of communications with the AGC on the said costs order) (see <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [63]). Taking into account the respondent’s seniority, his disciplinary antecedents and his lack of remorse (amongst other factors), we imposed a 15-month suspension on the respondent: <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [65] and [69]. Having considered the sanction imposed in <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>, Ms Lin aligned her position on sentence with that imposed in <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>. When she was given the opportunity to address this court in reply (after Mr Ravi had made his oral submissions), however, her final position was that a suspension that <span class="font-italic">exceeds</span> that in <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span> should be imposed in light of the inflammatory and unapologetic nature of Mr Ravi’s arguments at the hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 On the other hand, Mr Ravi stands by the DT’s recommendation of a collective penalty of $6,000, for the reasons we have set out at [43]–[45] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span style="color: rgba(54,95,145,1) "></span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 As we explained in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravi s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1141 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravi (2016)</span>”) at [31], a determination of the appropriate sanction in the context of disciplinary proceedings involves a consideration of the following principles: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>the protection of members of the public who are dependent on solicitors in the administration of justice;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>the upholding of public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>deterrence of similar defaults by the same solicitor and other solicitors in the future; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(d) </span>the punishment of the solicitor who is guilty of misconduct.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Of these, the paramount considerations are the protection of the public and the upholding of public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession. The ultimate question remains, in the words of this court in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 266 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravindra Samuel</span>”) at [13], “whether the solicitor in question is a fit and proper person to be an advocate<span class="font-italic"> </span>and solicitor of the court.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 As readily demonstrated in our analysis on due cause, Mr Ravi’s misconduct was seriously injurious to public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession and thus warrants a sanction that appropriately reflects this. Specific deterrence is also engaged given Mr Ravi’s history of disciplinary defaults of a similar nature (which we consider at [131] below). Even at this preliminary stage of the analysis, therefore, we are satisfied that imposing censure or a monetary penalty would be wholly insufficient. In this regard, reference may be made to the case of <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span>, which was the primary authority relied on by the Law Society. In<span class="font-italic"> Gopalan Nair</span>, the respondent wrote what were found to be offensive and abusive letters to the AG, in which he had called into question the integrity of the AG and threatened to “expose” the AG. He also threatened to publish the letter should the AG fail to respond and proceeded to fax the correspondence he had with the AG to various law firms in Singapore. The Court of Three Judges found that the nature of the respondent’s allegations cast serious aspersions against the integrity of the AG, and in finding that due cause arose, suspended the respondent for two years. In the present case, Mr Ravi’s misconduct not only engaged similar issues of casting aspersions on and threatening public confidence in the AG, but <span class="font-italic">went</span><span class="font-italic"> further</span> in many respects (which we elaborate upon at [140]–[143] below). The point is that, taking reference from the sentence in <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span> (and that in <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span> which we have considered at [112] above), it is clear to us that the relevant question is whether Mr Ravi’s misconduct warrants a period of suspension that is <span class="font-italic">at least </span>at a level comparable to what was imposed in <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span>, or whether it goes further and warrants the ultimate sanction of striking Mr Ravi off the roll of advocates and solicitors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 We emphasise that, as a matter of principle, the Court of Three Judges may consider and impose <span class="font-italic">any </span>sanction provided under s 83(1) of the LPA even if not expressly sought by the parties (see, for instance, <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Ooi Oon Tat</span> [2022] SGHC 185 and <span class="font-italic">Udeh</span><span class="font-italic"> Kumar</span>). In the context of disciplinary proceedings, every advocate and solicitor, as an officer of the Supreme Court, is ultimately subject to the control of the court: see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ang Boon Kong Lawrence</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 825 at [13]. In the exercise of this supervisory control over its officers, the court determines the propriety of the solicitor’s conduct and metes out the appropriate sanction when due cause is shown: see <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v CNH</span> [2022] 3 SLR 777 at [17]. The Law Society’s position, or Mr Ravi’s for that matter, therefore, does not and cannot constrain the court’s discretion in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Returning to the question posed at [116], we note that both parties agree that Mr Ravi’s misconduct in the present case does not involve dishonesty. Nevertheless, even proceeding on this assumption, a solicitor remains liable to be struck off (as opposed to merely being suspended) where he conducts himself in a way that either falls below the required standards of “integrity, probity and trustworthiness”, or “<span class="font-italic">brings grave dishonour to the profession</span>” [emphasis in original]: see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ismail bin </span><span class="font-italic">Atan</span> [2017] 5 SLR 746 (“<span class="font-italic">Ismail bin </span><span class="font-italic">Atan</span>”) at [21] and <span class="font-italic">Ravindra Samuel </span>at [15]. In <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Theng Beng Samuel </span>[2022] 4 SLR 467 (“<span class="font-italic">Samuel </span><span class="font-italic">Seow</span>”), we clarified that “fall[ing] below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness” and “bring[ing] grave dishonour to the profession” were two distinct elements (at [37] and [40]). The core concern of the inquiry in respect of the <span class="font-italic">first</span> element (of “fall[ing] below the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness”) is whether the solicitor in question has a <span class="font-italic">defect of character </span>that renders him unfit to remain an advocate and solicitor, with all the duties and responsibilities that this entails. In contrast, the <span class="font-italic">second</span> element (of “bring[ing] grave dishonour to the profession”) speaks to a different concern, which we framed as follows in <span class="font-italic">Samuel </span><span class="font-italic">Seow </span>at [39]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The second element of “bring[ing] grave dishonour to the profession” [emphasis in original omitted] speaks to a somewhat different concern. </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">To be a member of the legal profession is to be accredited as worthy of confidence from other solicitors, from the courts, and from the public</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> ….

This, in our view, revealed an ingrained attitude that may amount to a defect of character because Mr Ravi’s views are not only not rooted in fact but also seem to be <span class="font-italic">stubbornly held and acted upon</span>. There is also no doubt as to the utter disregard he has for the AG and the Law Society, both of which are key institutions of our legal system, and has to this extent brought dishonour to the standing of the legal profession. This is therefore a case where consideration should be given to striking him off the roll. However, having considered the relevant precedents, and in the light of all the circumstances, including the fact that we disregard entirely the First to Third Interview Statements when deciding on sentence, and in particular, the matters set out at [136] below, we hold that the appropriate sanction is the maximum term of suspension. The position would likely have been a striking off order if we were also sanctioning Mr Ravi for the First Charge.

It cannot be gainsaid that every legal practitioner has a core duty to uphold the integrity of the legal system and legal profession. Mr Ravi, instead, has attacked each of these in, respectively, advancing allegations of serious misconduct against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, and in making unwarranted threats and casting unwarranted aspersions against the Law Society. In making these baseless and grave allegations, Mr Ravi has demonstrated not only his failure to uphold public confidence in the integrity of the legal system and legal profession, but also his readiness to actively <span class="font-italic">undermine</span> them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Mr Ravi’s blatant disregard for these key legal institutions is demonstrated by the <span class="font-italic">seriousness</span> of the allegations made against the AG and the Law Society coupled with his persistent tendency to make these allegations with no regard for the truth. As highlighted above, Mr Ravi made the First Facebook Statement without any regard for the Court of Appeal’s <span class="font-italic">actual</span> observations in its Brief Grounds, nor the entirety of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings (despite his close personal involvement in the post-<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>proceedings). Continuing in this theme, the Third Facebook Statement cast the Law Society as a willing and complicit participant in the AG’s alleged harassment of Mr Ravi, when the Law Society, <span class="font-italic">in fact</span>, had no discretion but to apply for the DT to be convened under s 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 We consider Mr Ravi’s submission that his misconduct was a result of having reacted under pressure from the State through the Reservation Statement because it is relevant to consider whether the misconduct stemmed from “a lapse of judgment rather than a character defect” (<span class="font-italic">Samuel </span><span class="font-italic">Seow</span> at [41(a)(ii)]). In our judgment, the available evidence does <span class="font-italic">not</span> indicate that the disrespect shown to key legal institutions in relation to the Second and Third Charges was just a lapse of judgment. First, it was unlikely that the Reservation Statement was operating on Mr Ravi’s mind in any significant manner when he chose to make the impugned statements. The Reservation Statement was made on 4 February 2020 in the pre-trial conference for OS 111, which the High Court dismissed on 13 February 2020. Those proceedings, including the appeal against the High Court’s dismissal of OS 111, <span class="font-italic">concluded</span> when the Court of Appeal dismissed that appeal on 13 August 2020 in <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal </span>[2020] 2 SLR 883. The impugned Facebook posts were then made <span class="font-italic">two months</span> later, on 20 October 2020. In these circumstances, it is difficult to perceive how any pressure from the Reservation Statement operating on Mr Ravi would have survived this passage of time, let alone provide a sufficient explanation for either the making of the offending remarks some eight months later, or Mr Ravi’s persistence in maintaining the stance he has taken even up to the time of the hearing some <span class="font-italic">years </span>later, as we elaborate below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 After making these statements on 20 October 2020, Mr Ravi persisted in his attack against the AG by filing Suit 1068 on 4 November 2020 and contesting the AG’s application to strike out Suit 1068 in his written submissions dated 12 April 2021. Some months later, in the hearing before the DT, Mr Ravi held steadfast to his view that the Prosecution’s conduct in the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings raised questions as to the proper administration of justice. Finally, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr Ravi openly stated at the hearing before us on 9 November 2022 that he maintained his assertions and stance against the Prosecution. The fact that Mr Ravi has made no attempt to remove or retract his Interview Statements or his Facebook Statements despite the passage of more than two years is equally telling. The foregoing amply shows that Mr Ravi’s misconduct cannot be attributed to mere rashness or impulsivity on the spur of the moment, but instead was a <span class="font-italic">considered</span><span class="font-italic"> response</span> expressing his continuing views regarding these institutions. This reinforces our view that Mr Ravi’s misconduct discloses an ingrained belief which points to a defect in character rather than a mere lapse in judgment. Indeed, Mr Ravi’s misconduct is aggravated by his persistence in seeking to undermine the integrity of the legal profession with indifference to the truth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Then there is Mr Ravi’s history of related disciplinary antecedents and his unsavoury conduct at the hearing before us, points we return to at [131]–[135] below in the course of considering the relevant aggravating factors in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Grave dishonour to the Bar</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The justification for striking off a legal practitioner that brings grave dishonour to the profession lies in the perpetuation of that dishonour while he remains on the roll thus undermining the value of the accreditation reposed in other solicitors who share that accreditation: see <span class="font-italic">Samuel </span><span class="font-italic">Seow</span> at [39]. In the present case, Mr Ravi made grievous allegations against essential pillars of our legal system which threatened to undermine public confidence in the integrity of these key institutions, accusing them of abusing their position and powers to take unfair advantage of an accused person facing the death penalty and to deliberately mislead the court  (in the case of the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>), or of being complicit in an attempt to harass Mr Ravi (in the case of the Law Society). These allegations went beyond attacks on the integrity of these <span class="font-italic">institutions </span>themselves and, more fundamentally, cast doubt on the fairness and integrity of <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">criminal justice system as a whole</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Taking together the analysis at [121]–[127] above, it seems to us that there is basis for holding that Mr Ravi has shown himself not to be “worthy of confidence from other solicitors, from the courts, and from the public” (<span class="font-italic">Samuel </span><span class="font-italic">Seow</span> at [39]) as a representative of the legal profession entrusted with upholding its honour and dignity. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there are circumstances pointing away from the sanction of striking off</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 We turn to consider the third limb of the approach in <span class="font-italic">Samuel</span> <span class="font-italic">Seow</span>. We also consider at this stage the aggravating and mitigating factors of this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 We begin with the following aggravating factors in this case, which are relevant<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">:</span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>First, Mr Ravi’s status as a senior practitioner of close to 20 years’ standing at the material time. In this regard, it is well established that the more senior an advocate and solicitor, the more damage he does to the integrity of the legal profession: see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Nathan Edmund </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 905 at [33]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>Second, Mr Ravi has disciplinary antecedents.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>Third, Mr Ravi remains wholly unremorseful even up to and at the hearing of this matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The latter two factors warrant further elaboration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Section 83(5) of the LPA states that “the court may in addition to the facts of the case take into account the past conduct of the person concerned in order to determine what order should be made”. In this regard, the fact that an advocate and solicitor had previously committed a similar disciplinary offence is a “significant aggravating factor”: <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ng Bock Hoh Dixon </span>[2012] 1 SLR 348 at [35]. We note that Mr Ravi has a number of antecedents of a similar nature over the past 15 years. These are summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(a) </span>In <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravi </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 300, Mr Ravi admitted to being disrespectful to and behaving rudely before a district judge in open court. The Court of Three Judges found him guilty of misconduct under the statutory equivalent of s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA in force at the time, and sentenced him to a one-year suspension.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(b) </span>In <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravi </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy </span>[2012] SGDT 12 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravi (2012)</span>”), Mr Ravi made various allegations against a High Court Judge, including that of racial bias. The disciplinary tribunal found him guilty of misconduct under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA. Taking Mr Ravi’s mental condition and remorse into account, the disciplinary tribunal recommended a monetary penalty of $3,000.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(c) </span>In <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravi s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy </span>[2015] SGDT 5 and <span class="font-italic">Ravi (2016)</span>, Mr Ravi pleaded guilty to four charges involving the making of baseless allegations against the President of the Law Society and a fellow advocate and solicitor on social media (amongst others). The Court of Three Judges, noting the exceptional circumstances regarding Mr Ravi’s mental condition and the consequent need to protect public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession (<span class="font-italic">Ravi (2016) </span>at [73]), prohibited Mr Ravi from applying for a practising certificate for a period of two years.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">(d) </span>In <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v Ravi s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy </span>[2020] SGDT 8 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravi (2020)</span>”), Mr Ravi was found guilty of misconduct under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the LPA for making various allegations against a Deputy Public Prosecutor and a District Judge. The disciplinary tribunal, noting his remorse, recommended that he pay a monetary penalty of not less than $10,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 While we acknowledge that <span class="font-italic">Ravi (2012)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ravi (2016)</span> engaged somewhat different considerations due to Mr Ravi’s mental condition at the time, this was no longer a live consideration in <span class="font-italic">Ravi (2020)</span> or in the present case. While Mr Ravi cited the CRPD as a basis to mitigate his liability, this was misconceived. First, there was no evidence to suggest that his condition had contributed to his misconduct in this case. In fact, at the material time, Mr Ravi was practising under a conditional practising certificate which mandated, amongst other conditions, that Mr Ravi had to attend regular medical appointments to monitor his fitness to practise. Accordingly, there was no suggestion that Mr Ravi was labouring under his previous medical condition when he made the impugned remarks in October 2020, nor even at the point when he took on the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings in September 2019. Second, and in any case, Mr Ravi failed to elaborate on how the CRPD was relevant at all to this case. In this light, these antecedents demonstrate a degree of recalcitrance on Mr Ravi’s part, and also lays bare the obvious insincerity behind Mr Ravi’s claimed remorse in each successive instance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Turning to Mr Ravi’s conduct at the hearing, this was aggravating and again indicative of an utter lack of remorse (despite having claimed to be remorseful in his Written Submissions). At the hearing, Mr Ravi did not apologise for his misconduct, or, for that matter, make any reference to his claimed remorse; instead, he appeared to <span class="font-italic">double</span><span class="font-italic"> down</span> on his allegations against the Law Society and the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>. With regard to the former, Mr Ravi added to his insinuation that the Law Society was complicit in the AG’s harassment of him, stating that “the Law Society should not be a complaint mechanism for the Attorney-General”, and further alluded to broader systemic oppression arising from what he deemed the “pre-emptive powers” of the AG pursuant to s 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA. With regard to the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, Mr Ravi alleged that the AG’s “dishonesty” was not merely confined to the change of case in the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings, but lay also in the fact that they had persisted in opposing the review application in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span> despite the Registry Letter having indicated the possibility that there was a change of the Prosecution’s case at trial and on appeal in the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings. Mr Ravi contended that upon receipt of that letter, the AG had the duty to take the position that the mandatory death penalty be set aside, and further to withdraw from the review proceedings. The fact that they did not do so was, according to Mr Ravi, “dishonest”. This, despite the fact that, as the court subsequently noted, it was likely the case that the change of case and its legal significance was not appreciated at the material time. Remarkably, Mr Ravi also seemed to have overlooked the fact that at the very same time, <span class="font-italic">he himself thought the change of case had not prejudiced Gobi</span>: see [138] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Mr Ravi, in fact, went even further to allege that the <span class="font-italic">court</span> had “abdicate[d] its duties” <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">by failing to exercise its powers under s 394J(1)(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">b</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">) of the CPC to review the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Gobi</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> proceedings on its own motion.</span> <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">This point is</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> entirely irrelevant to the issues in the present proceedings, which are concerned with the impropriety of the allegations he had levied against the AG </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">et al</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> and the Law Society. </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In our view, these further accusations were </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">not only</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> indications of his impenitence, but yet another marker of his inclination to make baseless assertions of impropriety against key legal institutions.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>Mr Ravi even went so far as to impugn <span class="font-italic">the profession </span><span class="font-italic">as a whole</span> during his oral submissions, stating that he “[did] not feel any more part of an <span class="font-italic">honourable</span> profession” [emphasis added]. This was an attack on the standing and integrity of the legal profession insinuating, without any basis, that the profession was <span class="font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> honourable</span> or at least did not meet Mr Ravi’s standards of honourable conduct.

Within this allegedly unjust and oppressive system, Mr Ravi cast himself as someone who was simply “zealously pursuing … [his] cause [and] the oath [he had] taken to the rule of law”. This is reinforced in the contents of the 9 February e-mail, which was sent about three months after the hearing. In the 9 February e-mail, Mr Ravi complained that “[n]either of the state counsels [in OS 111] have been referred for disciplinary action but instead AG’s complaint had been <span class="font-italic">entertained</span> <span class="font-italic">against </span><span class="font-italic">[him] </span>which <span class="font-italic">reinforces the unfairness </span><span class="font-italic">[he] had highlighted at the hearing</span>” [emphasis added]. This wholly ignored the fact that Court of Appeal had stated at the outset that there was nothing to suggest that any of the parties even appreciated the significance of the change of position by the Prosecution in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review) </span>because it preceded <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>; as well as the fact that the Law Society had no discretion to “entertain” complaints referred to by the AG. These points had been highlighted to Mr Ravi at various junctures, but he nonetheless remained impervious to this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Before leaving this part of our analysis, we mention one factor that might redress the balance a little in favour of Mr Ravi in this assessment. That is the fact that when he made the allegations in the First to Third Facebook Statements, he did not <span class="font-italic">at the same time</span> publish the matters that were subsequently set out in the Statement of Claim that he filed in the ill-conceived proceedings he brought against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>. The Statement of Claim was filed and was posted by Mr Ravi on Facebook some two weeks or so later. We have referred to parts of that Statement of Claim because it leaves no doubt at all as to what Mr Ravi meant and intended to convey. But the fact that those parts of the Statement of Claim were not included in Mr Ravi’s Facebook Statements means that perhaps some of those who read the Facebook Statements at the time these were published may not have appreciated the full extent of his attack on the legal system. This is especially so since we also assume in Mr Ravi’s favour that such readers may have taken the First to Third Interview Statements in the way the DT mistakenly saw them, rather than with a full understanding of what Mr Ravi was saying as we have explained above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 We turn to consider the mitigating factors in this case. Preliminarily, we note that mitigating factors are a less persuasive consideration in disciplinary proceedings than in criminal cases, because of the public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the profession and in protecting the public (see <span class="font-italic">Ravi (2016) </span>at [33]; <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Kurubalan s/o Manickam Rengaraju </span>[2013] 4 SLR 91 at [48]–[49]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Mr Ravi highlights two factors in mitigation. The first is his claimed remorse. This is utterly without basis as evident in Mr Ravi’s conduct and we need say no more. The second mitigating factor relied on by Mr Ravi is his involvement in the <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> proceedings, which contributed to the correction of a grave miscarriage of justice. While this might in theory be considered mitigating if it has in fact advanced the public interest, the fact is that the review application ultimately turned on the change of the Prosecution’s case, a matter that was <span class="font-italic">first</span> <span class="font-italic">raised by the Court of Appeal </span>and not by Mr Ravi. Mr Ravi, in fact, maintained in his further submissions following the Registry Letter that “there <span class="font-italic">does not appear to have been an obvious prejudice</span> to [Gobi] caused by the change in case because the Court in [<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>] quite properly regarded the case against him as the case presented at trial and the case upon which evidence was taken.” [emphasis added]. This necessarily limits the extent of Mr Ravi’s personal contribution to the outcome in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>. Moreover, as the Court of Three Judges stated in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Wee Wei Fen </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 559 at [39], the court will only give consideration to the applicable mitigating circumstances insofar as they are consistent with the paramount principles of the protection of the public and the preservation of public confidence in the profession. In our judgment, the nature of Mr Ravi’s accusations against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> and the Law Society, coupled with his disciplinary history and lack of remorse, make it untenable to accord any significant mitigating weight at all to such considerations in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 We turn finally to consider the precedents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Here, we return to our earlier reference to the cases of <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair </span>and <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>, and address how Mr Ravi’s misconduct here was <span class="font-italic">more serious</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>than<span class="font-italic"> </span>that in issue in those cases. In relation to <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>, it is crucial to appreciate that the offending posts in that case <span class="font-italic">did not impugn the core functions of the AG to the same grave extent </span><span class="font-italic">that Mr Ravi’s Facebook Statements did</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>, the gravamen of wrong involved the respondent’s “wilful non-compliance with the [costs order which was] accompanied by acts taken with the aim of garnering public support for that non-compliance” (see <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [59]). In other words, even though the respondent’s misconduct involved the making of certain statements against the AG in a public forum, those statements <span class="font-italic">did not call into question or impugn </span>the AG’s performance of his central role in the administration of justice in Singapore. This placed Mr Ravi’s misconduct on an entirely different plane from that of the respondent in <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>, on whom we imposed a suspension of 15 months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Turning to <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair </span>(where a two-year suspension was imposed), the respondent there was a relatively more junior practitioner of around nine years’ standing at the time. Further, we take into account Mr Ravi’s disciplinary record. We also note that Mr Ravi published his offending statements to his significant following on Facebook, which held greater potential to undermine <span class="font-italic">public</span> confidence in the AG, whereas the respondent in <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span> had circulated his offensive letters only amongst certain <span class="font-italic">law firms</span> in Singapore. Most importantly, the gravity of the misconduct in <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span> is markedly less than that found in the present case. To appreciate this point, a closer examination of the facts and the nature of the misconduct in <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>must be undertaken.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The backdrop to <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair </span>was the decision of the High Court to strike Mr J B Jeyaretnam (“Mr Jeyaretnam”) off the roll of advocate and solicitors due to his criminal convictions. The Privy Council allowed the appeal against this decision: see <span class="font-italic">J</span><span class="font-italic"> B Jeyaratnam v Law Society of Singapore </span>[1988] 3 MLJ 425. In the course of those proceedings, the AG had advised the government that the Privy Council’s determination had no bearing on the criminal convictions of Mr Jeyaretnam, and further stated that he had been denied an opportunity to be heard before the Privy Council. The respondent, taking reference from a report of the proceedings before the Privy Council in a certain publication, then decided to send a letter to the AG, demanding to know why he had stated that he (the AG) had been denied an opportunity to be heard. In a subsequent letter, the respondent threatened to publish their correspondence should he not receive a satisfactory reply; a threat he eventually carried out. The High Court found that the respondent sought, by his first letter, “to show that the complainant was less than honest when [the AG] asserted that he was denied an opportunity of being heard by the Privy Council when the Council went into an examination of the merits of the convictions” (see <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair </span>at [25]). It was further found that he had no basis to insinuate this, and that those letters were written “deliberately with a view to discrediting the AG” (see <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair </span>at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Turning to the present case, Mr Ravi, by making the First and Second Facebook Statements, sought to accuse the AG, without basis, of <span class="font-italic">conducting the </span>Gobi<span class="font-italic"> prosecution</span> in a dishonest and unfair manner to such an extent that it could have <span class="font-italic">led to Gobi’s death</span>. As we had also observed above, it is hard to conceive of a more serious accusation against the AG. While the manner in which the integrity of the AG was questioned in <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair </span>was wholly unacceptable and the misconduct undoubtedly serious, the accusation there, in our view, did not rise to the same degree of seriousness as the present allegation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Viewed together with Mr Ravi’s further (and similarly baseless) allegations against the Law Society, what, in essence, sets this case apart from <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span> (and <span class="font-italic">Nalpon</span>, for that matter) is that Mr Ravi’s misconduct went further, both in terms of its <span class="font-italic">gravity</span> and <span class="font-italic">scope</span>. As we observed at [127] above, the nature and substance of Mr Ravi’s allegations toward both the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>and the Law Society are such that Mr Ravi was attacking the <span class="font-italic">legal</span><span class="font-italic"> system as a whole</span>. No solicitor can be permitted to recklessly and baselessly undermine the very pillars of the legal system in which he (as well as his fellow practitioners) operates; to do so would plainly cause grave injury to public confidence in the legal profession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In <span class="font-italic">Gopalan Nair</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the solicitor was not struck off but was suspended for two years. This was the maximum suspension available at the time. Although this is a close case, having regard to all the circumstances, we consider that (a) it is not necessary to strike Mr Ravi off the roll of advocates and solicitors, but (b) that imposing anything short of the maximum term of suspension that is now permitted would not be adequate to address the continuing danger that Mr Ravi, by his baseless and ill-conceived attacks, poses to public confidence in the administration of justice in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 For these reasons, we find that there is due cause for disciplinary action and impose a five years’ suspension under s 83(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA commencing on the date of this judgment.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 We order Mr Ravi to bear the Law Society’s costs.

Those proceedings began when Gobi was charged under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) for importing controlled drugs under Class A of the First Schedule to the MDA (the “Drugs”) of an amount punishable by death. At trial, the High Court found that Gobi did not know that the Drugs were of the nature of a Class A controlled drug and held that he had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. Gobi was thus convicted of an amended lesser charge of attempting to import the Drugs believing it to be a controlled drug under Class C. Gobi was acquitted of the capital charge: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian </span>[2017] SGHC 145 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Trial)</span>”). The Prosecution then appealed against this decision in CA/CCA 20/2017 (“CCA 20”). On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that Gobi had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. The CA set aside Gobi’s conviction on the amended lesser charge and convicted Gobi of the original capital charge. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 CM 3 was premised on a separate decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 2 SLR 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Adili</span>”) that had been released after <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, the Prosecution relying on the presumption under s 18(1) of the MDA, ran the case that the accused had been wilfully blind to the existence of certain drugs found in his possession. The CA held that the Prosecution could not invoke the s 18(1) MDA presumption to prove that the accused person was wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs because the s 18(1) presumption was a presumption of <span class="font-italic">fact </span>while the doctrine of wilful blindness was a construct of <span class="font-italic">law</span>. The CA, however, left open the question of whether the same was true of s 18(2) of the MDA.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 On 19 October 2020, the Court of Appeal heard CM 3 and allowed Gobi’s application. The Court of Appeal, in the context of considering the state of an accused person’s knowledge of the nature of a controlled drug in his possession, held in brief grounds of its judgment released the same day (the “Brief Grounds”) that a finding that the accused person had been wilfully blind to the fact in question, namely the nature of the controlled drug, was distinct from a finding that he had actual knowledge of that fact; and further, that when relying on the doctrine of wilful blindness to make out its case, the Prosecution could not invoke the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA. Wilful blindness was a legal construct where the law imputed knowledge to the accused person in certain circumstances, whereas the presumption was a legal device by which a state of fact was presumed. The Court of Appeal also held that the Prosecution’s case at trial had been that Gobi was <span class="font-italic">wilfully blind to the nature of the Drugs</span>, whereas its case on appeal was that Gobi had <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of the same. The CA further held that this change of case was prejudicial to Gobi. Applying the principles it had laid down in the <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>case distinguishing between wilful blindness and actual knowledge because at trial, the CA found that the Prosecution had relied on the presumption of knowledge even though its case was one of wilful blindness; whereas on appeal, it ran its case on the footing that the accused person had actual knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug in his possession. Given the CA’s holding that the presumption of knowledge could not be relied on where the case was one of wilful blindness, and given that the Prosecution had not otherwise proved that Gobi was wilfully blind to the nature of the Drugs, it set aside his conviction. The Court further held that the Prosecution could not run a case based on actual knowledge in the appeal because the accused person had not been confronted with a case of actual knowledge at trial. Accordingly, the Court reinstated his conviction on the lesser charge that the trial court had substituted in place of the original charge in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Trial</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>. The Court released the full grounds of its decision later that day: see <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 Shortly after the delivery of the Brief Grounds, Mr Ravi was interviewed by The Online Citizen Asia, where he made the following statements (“the Interview Statements”): </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">… [O]ne of the things which is troubling in this decision today, is that the Court noted that the Attorney-General, or the Public Prosecutor ran a different case in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Then that begs the question and calls into the fairness of the administration of justice in Gobi’s case by the Prosecution, because the Prosecution has a duty as ministers of justice to be fair.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">…</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">[T]he Public Prosecutor has been overzealous in his prosecution and that has led to the death sentence of Gobi …</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">…</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Please apologise to Gobi, and for the suffering, his family, and he has gone through during this process, because the Prosecution, as the Court observed, ran a different case in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. So therefore, the Prosecution, essentially the fairness of the Prosecution, is called into question by the Court itself.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 On 20 October 2020, the then-Deputy Attorney General Mr Hri Kumar Nair (“the DAG”) wrote to Mr Ravi to inform him that the Interview Statements contained serious allegations that the Public Prosecutor had acted in bad faith or maliciously in the prosecution of Gobi, and alleged that Mr Ravi was aware that such allegations were false and inflammatory (“the DAG’s Letter”). Shortly after, Mr Ravi uploaded the DAG’s Letter on his Facebook page (the “First Facebook Post”). The First Facebook Post contained the following statements:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. The “First Facebook Statement”:</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">… [T]hese government lawyers who handled Gobi’s case are the wrongdoers. The public should demand the AG to retract this letter and apologise.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The “Second Facebook Statement”:</div><div class="txt-body text-left">I have already taken instructions from Gobi and his family to commence proceedings against [the Attorney-General], [the DAG] and Mr Faizal SC in court. I will file the writ of summons in the next few days for both personally against all 3 of the above Government lawyers and also against their offices in which they hold public appointment. They have to be accountable to Gobi and his family in court and be subject to rigorous cross examination and public scrutiny of their conduct of Gobi’s case …</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. The “Third Facebook Statement”:</div><div class="txt-body text-left">I will respond to [the DAG’s] threatening and humiliating letter accordingly. I will also commence proceedings against law society [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] if it does not do its part to protect lawyers and the independence of the profession if it entertains any further complaints or participates in any harassment by the [Attorney-General] to harass me in doing my job.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 On 22 October 2020, Mr Ravi replied to the DAG’s Letter, acknowledging that he had made the Interview Statements (the “Reply Letter”). He reiterated that he was instructed by Gobi to commence legal action against the Attorney-General (the “AG”), the DAG and “members of the Prosecution who had carriage” of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>proceedings (collectively, the “AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>”). He uploaded the contents of the Reply Letter on Facebook the same day (the “Second Facebook Post”). Mr Ravi, on behalf of Gobi, then commenced HC/S 1068/2020 (“Suit 1068”) against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> on 4 November 2020, alleging that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>had committed the tort of misfeasance in public office.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 Following a complaint by the DAG (the “DAG’s Complaint”), the Law Society brought four charges against Mr Ravi before a disciplinary tribunal (the “DT”). These are as follows: </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. The first charge was that Mr Ravi conduct himself in a manner unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor by giving the Interview Statements, which were false and/or misleading and intended to convey that the AG had acted in bad faith, maliciously and/or improperly (the “First Charge”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The second charge was that Mr Ravi had failed to treat the AG <span class="font-italic">et </span><span class="font-italic">al</span> with fairness and courtesy in making the First and Second Facebook Statements (the “Second Charge”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. The third charge was that Mr Ravi had acted in a manner contrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession by making the Third Facebook Statement against the Law Society (the “Third Charge”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">d. The fourth charge was that Mr Ravi acted improperly in sending the Reply Letter and threatening to commence legal proceedings against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>(the “Fourth Charge”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The DT convicted Mr Ravi of the Second to Fourth Charges, but determined that the First Charge was not made out as it found that Mr Ravi had a reasonable basis to make the Interview Statements since the CA, in its Brief Grounds, noted that the change of the Prosecution’s case had prejudiced Gobi. The DT held that there was no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action and imposed a collective monetary penalty of $6,000 for Mr Ravi’s misconduct.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The Law Society then applied for Mr Ravi to be sanctioned under s 83(1) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “LPA”). It argued that due cause for disciplinary action had been made out on the basis of the Second to Fourth Charges, and that the appropriate sanction was for Mr Ravi to be suspended. Mr Ravi accepted the DT’s decision in relation to his conviction on the Second to Fourth Charges but argued that his misconduct did not give rise to due cause.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There was due cause for disciplinary action</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The key issue was whether Mr Ravi’s misconduct was sufficiently serious to warrant the imposition of sanctions under s 83(1) of the LPA. A proper assessment of the seriousness of Mr Ravi’s misconduct required a granular examination of the context in which Mr Ravi’s various statements were made. In this regard, while the First Charge was not in issue, the Court considered it helpful to revisit the DT’s analysis because it not only shed light on why the DT saw fit to dismiss the First Charge, but also because a correct understanding of the Interview Statements was key to understanding the true gravity of Mr Ravi’s misconduct: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[5</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0], [52]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[7</span><span class="font-weight-bold">4]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The Court disagreed with the DT’s analysis on the First Charge. While the DT took into account the CA’s observation in the Brief Grounds that Gobi had been “prejudiced” by the Prosecution’s change of case, it had not considered the CA’s qualification in the Brief Grounds that the Prosecution <span class="font-italic">could not have anticipated</span> that it had changed its case due to the existing law at the time. This qualification was made in light of the fact that <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> was only released <span class="font-italic">after</span> the conclusion of the proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>. Therefore, the clarification in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> regarding the distinction between the legal concept of wilful blindness to a fact and actual knowledge of that fact and consequently the availability of the presumption of fact in s 18(1) of the MDA in the former context was not available to the Prosecution during the proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal)</span>: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[5</span><span class="font-weight-bold">7]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">59] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[6</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The CA’s finding in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span> that Gobi had been “prejudiced” also had to be understood in light of the requirements for the exercise of the CA’s power to review earlier decisions of an appellate court. The review power, which Gobi sought to invoke in CM 3, could only be exercised where it was shown not only that there was, for instance, a change of the law, but also that this change could have <span class="font-italic">a material bearing on the outcome of the case</span>. Therefore, the CA’s finding in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review) </span>that Gobi had been “prejudiced” was directed at whether the Prosecution’s change of case could be material to the outcome of the case, and <span class="font-italic">did not</span> suggest the Prosecution had conducted the proceedings against Gobi unfairly or improperly: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[6</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Mr Ravi’s Interview Statements contained the allegation that the Prosecution had been excessively enthusiastic in the conduct of the criminal proceedings against Gobi in an unfair manner that caused the sentence of death to be wrongly imposed on him. The Interview Statements also alleged that the Prosecution’s conduct of the proceedings against Gobi called into question the fairness of the administration of justice, and that the CA itself had called into question the fairness of the Prosecution. It was clear from the Interview Statements themselves, Mr Ravi’s subsequent conduct in making the Facebook Statements, and his claim in Suit 1068 that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>had committed the tort of misfeasance of public office that Mr Ravi intended to convey impropriety on the part of the Prosecution. When Mr Ravi’s Interview Statements were juxtaposed against the actual nature of the Prosecution’s conduct of the <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>proceedings and a correct understanding of the CA’s findings in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>, there was no doubt that Mr Ravi had no reasonable basis to make the Interview Statements: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">63] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">71]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 The Court held that there was due cause for disciplinary action against Mr Ravi. To begin with the Second Charge, Mr Ravi’s First Facebook Statement referred to the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>as “wrongdoers”. The term “wrongdoers”, had to be seen in light of the Interview Statements (made one day prior) and the statement of claim filed in Suit 1068. In particular, the statement of claim (which Mr Ravi had also posted on Facebook around two weeks after making the First Facebook Post) alleged that the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> was “dishonest”, had engaged in “deplorable conduct”, and “had taken unfair advantage” of Gobi leading to the death sentence wrongfully imposed on him. Further, it was relevant to consider that the AG, who has the power to commence and conduct of criminal prosecutions, is an essential pillar of the Singapore legal system. The First Facebook Statement was a direct attack toward the AG’s execution of this core function, and therefore amounted to a serious accusation against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span>.: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[7</span><span class="font-weight-bold">8]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[8</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 Further, this allegation of “wrongdo[ing]” was made without a reasonable basis. In its Brief Grounds, the CA clarified that the parties <span class="font-italic">did not </span>have the benefit of the clarification in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at the time of trial, and that the Prosecution’s case might have been formulated on the premise that the doctrine of wilful blindness was essentially the same as actual knowledge and therefore that the s 18(2) presumption could not be invoked. This was why the issue of the Prosecution’s change of case was not raised in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Appeal</span>) or in the initial submissions in <span class="font-italic">Gobi (Review)</span>, but instead raised by the Court of Appeal of its own motion. As such, while the CA held that the change of case had caused prejudice to Gobi, it <span class="font-italic">did not</span> <span class="font-italic">conclude that the Prosecution had done this deliberately</span> (unlike what Mr Ravi’s statements suggested). The prejudice was a result of a confluence of unique circumstances, as well as the evolution and clarification of the legal position following <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>. Given his involvement in the review proceedings, Mr Ravi ought to have known that his allegations against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>lacked basis: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[88]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[89]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 The sense of unfairness and discourtesy shown by Mr Ravi toward the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> in his First and Second Facebook Statements was enhanced due to the potential public reach of those statements. The misconduct under the Second Charge was a serious breach of the solicitor’s duty to treat other legal practitioners with fairness and courtesy: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">91]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[9</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 In relation to the Third Charge, Mr Ravi’s Third Facebook Statement contained a baseless accusation that the Law Society, in “entertain[ing]” the DAG’s Complaint, was participating in “harassment by [the] AG” against Mr Ravi in “doing [his] job” and thereby was failing to “protect lawyers and the independence of the profession”. This lacked basis as, upon the AG’s request, the Law Society <span class="font-italic">must</span> apply for a disciplinary tribunal to be appointed (see s 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA). The fact that Mr Ravi knew of this when he made the Third Facebook Statement, yet persisted in making the allegations he did suggested that he had made the allegations with reckless disregard for the truth. The Third Facebook Statement amounted to an insinuation that the Law Society, by acting on the AG’s request, would be abdicating its core purpose in the protection of lawyers and the independence of the profession. This was a serious breach of the solicitor’s duty not to act in a manner contrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[10</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[10</span><span class="font-weight-bold">7]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 In relation to the Fourth Charge, the contents of Mr Ravi’s Reply Letter strengthened the Court’s interpretation of Mr Ravi’s conduct as one that persistently insinuated or alleged impropriety on the part of the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> and buttressed the finding that due cause was made out: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[1</span><span class="font-weight-bold">09]</span>.   </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sanction</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 Mr Ravi’s misconduct was seriously harmful to public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession. The imposition of censure or a monetary penalty would be insufficient; instead, the relevant question was whether Mr Ravi’s misconduct warrants a period of suspension or striking Mr Ravi off the roll of advocates and solicitors: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[11</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 Mr Ravi’s misconduct exhibited a fundamental lack of respect and a blatant disregard for the integrity of Singapore’s key legal institutions. Mr Ravi’s views were not only not rooted in fact but also seem to be stubbornly held and acted upon, revealing a defect of character. Mr Ravi’s history of related past disciplinary cases and his unsatisfactory conduct at the hearing before the Court of Three Judges pointed to this ingrained attitude: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[12</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">126]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 Mr Ravi utter disregard for the AG and the Law Society, both of which are key institutions of the Singapore legal system, had brought dishonour to the standing of the legal profession: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">127</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 The relevant aggravating factors include: Mr Ravi’s status as a senior lawyer of close to 20 years’ standing at the material time; his disciplinary cases of a similar nature over the past 15 years; and his lack of remorse. While Mr Ravi claimed to be remorseful about his misconduct, he had not only failed to apologise for his misconduct but had doubled down on his allegations against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al </span>and the Law Society during the hearing, going as far to suggest that the court had abdicated its duties: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[13</span><span class="font-weight-bold">0]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[13</span><span class="font-weight-bold">5]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">24 Mr Ravi’s involvement in the <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>proceedings might in theory be considered mitigating. However, the mitigating effect of Mr Ravi’s involvement was limited by the fact that it was the CA that first raised the matter of the Prosecution’s change of case. Indeed, after the CA raised the issue and invited submissions from the parties on this point, Mr Ravi’s own position was that it was not thought to be prejudicial to his client. Further, the nature of Mr Ravi’s accusations against the AG <span class="font-italic">et al</span> and the Law Society, coupled with his disciplinary history and lack of remorse, made it untenable to accord any significant mitigating weight to his conduct: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">138]</span>.   </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">25 The Court imposed a five years’ suspension against Mr Ravi. In particular, the Court noted in Mr Ravi’s favour that he had not posted the statement of claim in Suit 1068 at the same time that he made the Facebook Statements, and thus that some of those who read the Facebook Statements at the time they were published may not have appreciated the full extent of his attack on the legal system. Further, the Interview Statements were not considered in determining the appropriate sentence: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">74], [120]</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold">[13</span><span class="font-weight-bold">6]</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">26 The Court emphasised that no solicitor can be permitted to recklessly and baselessly undermine the very pillars of the legal system in which he operates and noted that to do would cause grave injury to public confidence in the legal profession: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[14</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
