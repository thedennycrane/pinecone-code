</div>  On a closer reading, it appears that the “incorporation defence” is in effect an argument that the plaintiff remains bound by clause 4 of the SSP Agreement, and therefore has the same effect as the “variation defence” outlined at [25] above.  The chief distinction between the “incorporation defence” and the “variation defence” is on <span class="font-italic">how</span> clause 4 of the SSP Agreement continues to bind the plaintiffs, and it is therefore unsurprising that, in the defendants’ <span class="font-italic">own</span> closing submissions, what eventually morphed into the separate “incorporation defence” was initially merely a subset of the “variation defence”.

This is because, had the shares been transferred to him, then, as the majority shareholder of OOB Sichuan, he would have been in a position to negotiate a trade sale of OOB Sichuan and made a profit from the sale.

Specifically, the Court of Appeal accepted at [131] a number of “canons and techniques of contractual interpretation”.

At [32], the Court of Appeal observed that the text of the contract should be the “first port of call” in interpreting contractual terms.

The first defendant is a private equity fund with a limited duration and it must have impressed upon the first defendant the need for it to realise its investment within a specified period of time.  Indeed, the first defendant admitted that he knew that the first plaintiff had a “limited lifespan” as a fund, and that he was aware that the first plaintiff was seeking an “exit strategy” to achieve returns on its investments.

</div>  The payment was to be in instalments.  The key provision in this agreement is clause 4, which requires the second plaintiff to transfer all the OOB Sichuan shares to the first defendant upon the latter giving notice for such transfer.  Parties are in agreement as to the reason for this clause.  Specifically, the first defendant had informed the plaintiffs that he needed them to transfer all their OOB Sichuan shares to him so that he could use them as collateral to raise funding to pay the amounts due to the plaintiffs.

If the shares were priced too low, that might cause the OOB Sichuan share prices to fall drastically, and the first defendant did not want this to happen because, on his own evidence, he was looking for either an opportunity to sell OOB Sichuan, or to raise financing on the back of OOB Sichuan shares that he had.  Further, parties were in agreement that the NEEQ regulations were changed in March 2017 to prohibit any share transfers at “zero consideration”.

</div>  There was never any discussion about a transfer of the shares at no consideration.  There is also no letter, email, or any correspondence by the first defendant to the plaintiffs accusing them of being in breach of clause 4 of the SSP Agreement during this time.  After the NEEQ regulations were amended in March 2017, the shares could no longer be transferred at “zero consideration”.  This meant, in my view, that clause 4 was effectively inoperable.  The first defendant himself admitted in his oral evidence that the amendment to the NEEQ regulations caught the parties out, and that the circumstances had changed because of this.

But, according to the first defendant, the plaintiffs refused to carry out the informal arrangement after initially agreeing to it.  Specifically, the plaintiffs declined to route the moneys back to the first defendant because of concerns about the capital gains tax they would pay.

</div>  If there had been an agreement to “recycle” moneys for multiple small batch share transfers, the first defendant would not have to work out how much funds were required for each transfer of shares, and simply could have paid the plaintiffs any amount, and then asked for the return of the moneys back to him for a further transfer of the same number of shares.  Any such discussion or planning about this alleged agreement to “recycle” moneys paid to the plaintiffs was conspicuously absent from the documentary evidence.  Also, there was in evidence a WeChat exchange between the first defendant’s assistant and one of the plaintiffs’ staff that showed that it was in fact the first defendant who was dictating the number of shares to be transferred and the price per share.

</div>  This was significantly higher than the agreed price for these shares, which was RMB 10 million for all the shares, or approximately RMB 48 per share.

This might have been because he acknowledged, at least tacitly, that the inability to transfer the whole of the OOB Sichuan shares to him was not through any fault of the plaintiffs.  But, the more likely explanation is that he was fully aware that his obligation to make payments in accordance with the payment schedule was not subject to the second plaintiff first transferring the OOB Sichuan shares to him.  It is the first defendant’s own conduct that demonstrates this most clearly, as explained below.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 On 3 July 2017, the first defendant made a payment of RMB 500,000 to the second plaintiff.

</div>  This was a payment directly to the second plaintiff’s bank account and not to its securities account, which strongly suggests that the moneys were <span class="font-italic">not</span> paid in expectation of any transfer of shares from the plaintiffs.  The first defendant seeks to explain this away by claiming, in his AEIC, that the plaintiffs had asked him to make payments into the second plaintiff’s bank account instead of using secondary market trades.

</div>  This would, on the first defendant’s evidence, allow for the circumvention of NEEQ trading rules, which did not allow trades at more than 50% below the market price.  This explanation struck me as implausible for three reasons.  First, the first defendant could not produce any evidence beyond his bare allegation in his AEIC that the plaintiffs had requested for payments to be made into the second plaintiff’s bank account instead of its securities account.  No emails, message records, or written correspondence evidence this assertion.  Second, I do not see how transfers to the second plaintiff’s bank account would have obviated the need under the NEEQ trading rules for there to have been <span class="font-italic">also</span> a payment of moneys to the second plaintiff’s securities account that corresponded to the share transfer.  The first defendant would <span class="font-italic">still</span> have had to effect a transfer to the plaintiffs’ securities account in order for the share transfer to have a price reflected for it.

The first defendant then made a series of payments to the second plaintiff’s bank account, not its securities account.  These payments were made in the course of a month: RMB 300,000 on 28 July, RMB 100,000 on 1 August, RMB 100,000 on 2 August, RMB 200,000 on 3 August, RMB 100,000 on 7 August and RMB 200,000 on 24 August 2017.

First, as already described, the OOB Sichuan shares could not be transferred outright without any corresponding payment over the NEEQ.  Second, clause 5 of the SSP Agreement required the OOB Sichuan shares transferred to the first defendant to be charged in favour of the plaintiffs in order to secure payment of the outstanding amounts.  That being the case, it was completely unclear to me how the first defendant proposed to raise financing on the transferred shares when they were supposed to be charged to the plaintiffs.  On this point, the first defendant gave a rather preposterous answer when he claimed, during the course of his oral evidence and for the first time, that clause 5 of the SSP Agreement was never intended by the parties to be performed.

</div>  It does not detract from the plaintiffs’ obligation under clause 4 of the SSP Agreement to transfer the OOB Sichuan shares <span class="font-italic">before</span> the first defendant is obliged to make payment.  Put another way, according to the defendants, the obligation to transfer the OOB Sichuan shares to the first defendant is a <span class="font-italic">condition precedent</span> to his payment obligations under the Term Sheet.  Since the shares were not transferred, the first defendant’s payment obligations never kicked in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The circumstances leading to the execution of the Term Sheet make it clear that the defendants’ position is an untenable one.  This is for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 First, and most fundamentally, as I have already explained (at [64]), the proper interpretation of the SSP Agreement does not support the defendants’ argument that the clause 4 was a condition precedent to the first defendant’s payment obligations in that agreement.  Hence, the defendants’ entire case on the <span class="font-italic">incorporation</span> of clause 4 into the Term Sheet or that the Term Sheet is simply a <span class="font-italic">variation</span> of the SSP Agreement fails at the very first hurdle because clause 4 was never a condition precedent to the payment obligations of the first defendant in the first place.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, as has been explained above (at [53]), it is clear that parties had come to the shared understanding that clause 4 of the SSP Agreement was practically inoperable after March 2017.  I accept Mr Ding’s evidence that, even prior to March 2017, the plaintiffs were willing and ready to transfer the OOB Sichuan shares, but had been asked not to by the first defendants.  The plaintiffs were requested not to transfer their OOB Sichuan shares to the first defendant over the NEEQ before March 2017 because, amongst other reasons, the first defendant wanted to determine the price at which the shares were to be transferred so that the trading price of the OOB Sichuan shares would not be affected (see [53] above).  Then, the change in the NEEQ regulations in March 2017 made it no longer possible for parties to even entertain the idea of transferring the shares at no consideration.  As I have found, the first defendant subsequently tried to think of solutions to the problem of how the shares could be transferred, and it is clear that he was in control of the process of when and how the shares would be transferred.  From the plaintiffs’ perspective, they were not concerned about the mechanics of the process, save that they did not wish to pay unnecessary capital gains tax that might be incurred if the price set by the first defendant for each transfer was too high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Third, it is not disputed that the first defendant had decided, on its own, to suspend the OOB Sichuan shares from trading while the negotiations on the Term Sheet were in progress with the plaintiffs.  The counter was suspended on 11 September 2017 and it remained so until 29 December 2017.

</div>
</div>  The Term Sheet was executed by the parties on 20 September 2017, whilst the counter was still suspended from trading.  Given these facts, I find that the parties could not possibly have intended to subject the first defendant’s payment obligations to the transfer of the OOB Sichuan shares to the first defendant.  It is noteworthy in this regard that the first defendant was due to make his first three instalment payments on 30 September, 30 October and 30 November 2017 respectively.  It would be inconsistent with the timing in the schedule of payments to insist that the plaintiffs had to effect the transfer of the shares <span class="font-italic">before</span> the payments were due and while the share counter was suspended from trading.  One cannot simply ignore the trading status of the OOB Sichuan shares at the time of the agreement.  It was impossible to transfer the shares at that time.  I therefore do not accept that the parties had intended for share transfer obligations to apply at a time where the transfer of shares was <span class="font-italic">not even possible</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Fourth, it must be borne in mind that the Term Sheet was precipitated by the threat of legal action by the plaintiff, through their Chinese lawyers.  The first defendant did not reply to the Chinese lawyers’ letter to state that it was the plaintiffs who were in breach of their obligations in failing to transfer the OOB Sichuan shares.  Instead, as already mentioned above (see [15]), the first defendant made further payments to the second plaintiff, without any corresponding written demand for the transfer of more shares.  Not only that, in the Term Sheet, the first defendant agreed to provide security for his indebtedness in the form of the Metro shares.  I find that it would have been incongruous for the first defendant to have agreed to provide security if he was not at that time obligated to make any payments to the plaintiffs until the OOB Sichuan shares were transferred to him.  If that transfer had to take place before any payment, those transferred OOB Sichuan shares could have been charged as security to the plaintiffs, as was what was envisaged under clause 5 of the SSP Agreement.  The provision of security in the form of the Metro shares sheds light on the intent of the parties in executing the Term Sheet, which must have been that the first defendant was obliged to make payment in accordance with the payment schedule regardless of whether any shares in OOB Sichuan were transferred by the plaintiffs.  This reflects the reality of the situation at that time, which was that the parties could not work out a way to carry out the transfer for the OOB Sichuan shares to the first defendant over the NEEQ without any corresponding payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Finally, it is also relevant that it was the first defendant who came up with the payment schedule to be included in the Term Sheet.

</div>  This makes it quite clear that the Term Sheet was in essence an extension of time granted to the first defendant to make payment of what he had agreed to pay the plaintiffs.  There is nothing in the correspondence leading to the Term Sheet’s execution where the parties even discussed or mentioned the transfer of the OOB Sichuan shares as a pre-condition to the payment obligations.  I find that, if it was indeed the case that the share transfer was a condition precedent, the first defendant would have at least mentioned this in the negotiations in written communication of some sort.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Given all the circumstances, I find that the contextual background to the Term Sheet shows that the plaintiffs are right that the agreement for the first defendant to make the instalment payments in accordance with the schedule was <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">not</span> conditional on the transfer of the OOB Sichuan shares to the first defendant.  It cannot be said that the Term Sheet was merely a variation of the SSP Agreement given the intentions of the parties when the Term Sheet was entered into, nor can it be contended that clause 4 of the SSP Agreement was <span class="font-italic">somehow</span> incorporated into the Term Sheet.  As I have found, the parties were of the view that clause 4 of the SSP Agreement was practically inoperable, and they wanted to enter into the Term Sheet to extend the time granted to the first defendant to make payment.  In other words, the Term Sheet superseded the SSP Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The conduct of the parties subsequent to the Term Sheet</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 My conclusions in relation to the proper interpretation of the Term Sheet are buttressed by the conduct of the parties <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> to the Term Sheet being entered into.  The case law in relation to the value of subsequent conduct in contractual interpretation makes clear that, subject to certain caveats, post-contractual conduct can be an aid in the interpretation of contractual terms.  In fact, I have already extensively referred to the parties’ post-contractual conduct as an aid in interpreting the SSP Agreement (see for example, [66] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In <span class="font-italic">Hewlett-Packard Singapore (Sales) Pte Ltd v Chin Shu Hwa Corinna </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1083 (“<span class="font-italic">Hewlett-Packard</span>”) at [56], the Court of Appeal stated that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… we are not endorsing a blanket prohibition on the use of subsequent conduct.  Like the question of the admissibility of prior negotiations, the question of the admissibility of subsequent conduct remains an open one that should be decided on a more appropriate occasion … We do, however, reiterate that any such evidence must satisfy the tripartite requirements of relevancy, reasonable availability and clear and obvious context mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In the subsequent case of <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann Development Pte Ltd v Takashimaya Singapore Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 627 (“<span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann Development</span>”), the Court of Appeal referred to subsequent conduct to determine the parties’ agreement on the meaning of a term of the contract at [86], observing that these events “reflect[ed] the parties’ understanding” of how a particular term was to be put into effect.  The position in <span class="font-italic">Ngee Ann Development</span> utilising subsequent conduct as an aid to contractual interpretation was highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Centre for Laser and Aesthetic Medicine Pte Ltd v GPK Clinic (Orchard) Pte Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 1 SLR 180 at [51], where the Court of Appeal observed that subsequent conduct in contractual interpretation was permissible but is “in general only of relevance if the subsequent conduct provides <span class="font-italic">cogent evidence</span> of the parties’ agreement at the time when the contract was concluded.” [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Subsequent conduct was also found to be an aid to interpretation in this court’s decision of <span class="font-italic">Solomon Alliance Management Pte Ltd v Pang Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Kuan</span> [2019] 4 SLR 577 at [73] as it satisfied the tripartite requirements of relevancy, reasonable availability, and clear or obvious context.  I am satisfied that the tripartite requirements are met on the instant facts in relation to the Term Sheet as well.  The parties’ behaviour subsequent to the agreement of the Term Sheet is relevant in that it sheds light on what the parties had regarded their obligations <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> each other under the Term Sheet to entail.  This provides a further basis for determining what the parties’ objective intentions were when the Term Sheet was entered into.  The requirement that information as to the post-contractual conduct be reasonably available is also satisfied, given that both parties engaged in correspondence with each other regarding payment, and with the first defendant having made payments in accordance with the terms the Term Sheet.  Finally, given that the Term Sheet expressly prescribed payment obligations between the parties, I accept that the subsequent conduct of the parties in this case related to that clear and obvious context.  Accordingly, the subsequent conduct of the parties is an appropriate aid to contractual interpretation of the Term Sheet on the instant facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 For completeness, I note that I saw no reason why the interpretation of the SSP Agreement could not also be assisted by reference to the parties’ subsequent conduct.  The tripartite requirements outlined in <span class="font-italic">Zurich</span> ([37] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and referred to in <span class="font-italic">Hewlett-Packard</span> are also met.  In particular, the parties’ subsequent conduct is relevant insofar as it illustrates not only what the parties believed their obligations in the SSP Agreement to be, but also how the parties subsequently recognised that certain obligations, such as those in clause 4, were rendered inoperable.  This necessarily involves consideration of what clause 4 had <span class="font-italic">initially</span> been envisaged as requiring.  Second, the requirement that information as to the post-contractual actions be reasonably available is also satisfied, given that the parties’ conduct after the signing of the SSP Agreement were mostly documented in their correspondence.  Further, given that the SSP Agreement expressly prescribed obligations on both the signatories, I am satisfied that the subsequent conduct of the parties related to that clear and obvious context.  The subsequent conduct of the parties could therefore be of assistance in contractual interpretation of the SSP Agreement, as has been done above at, for example, [66] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I pause at this point to note that subsequent conduct cannot be used to support an interpretation that is in direct contradiction to the express terms: <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [88].

It is quite likely that he would have obtained per share financing at the same rate for all the 1,043,200 OOB Sichuan Shares, as they were only 25.2% of the total shares in OOB Sichuan. Financiers would normally be willing to take any percentage of shares in a company below 50% … Therefore, financiers would likely have been prepared to take all OOB Sichuan Shares, while the per share rate of financing usually remains unchanged. Therefore, we can assume that if [the first defendant] obtained and pledged Tembusu’s 1,043,200 OOB Sichuan Shares, he would have obtained <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">RMB 46,023,500</span> in financing at that time. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The obvious difficulty with Jiang Kai’s reasoning in this regard is clear – like is not being compared with like.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Given the Term Sheet’s express reference to the purchase of shares in OOB Sichuan, it must be the case that the parties to the Term Sheet had contemplated the issue of the transfer of shares, but chose nonetheless not to deal with that in the Term Sheet by including a term to provide for the transfer.  In other words, the parties consciously left the issue of the transfer of the shares unaddressed in their agreement.  This in turn raises the question of whether or not there might be an implied term in the Term Sheet that deals with this issue of the transfer of the shares.  In this regard, it must be remembered that there is no basis for the incorporation of clause 4 of the SSP Agreement given my finding (above at [74] to [80]) that the clause had been rendered practically inoperable by the change to the NEEQ regulations and as such, the parties could not have intended to incorporate such a clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”), the Court of Appeal held at [93] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the light of these observations, we summarise our views on the implication of terms into a contract. First, this process is best understood as an exercise in giving effect to the parties’ <span class="font-italic">presumed</span> intentions. It is presumed because the parties have not expressed any words, which are capable of bearing the meaning sought to be achieved by the implied term.  Were there to be any express words, that would be a matter of interpretation, not implication ... It is thus an exercise in filling the gaps in the contract. But in doing so, it is of paramount importance that the courts do so with due regard to what the <span class="font-italic">parties</span> would be presumed to have intended.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Court of Appeal went on to summarise the three-step process by which the implication of terms is to be considered at [101] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It follows from these points that the implication of terms is to be considered using a three-step process:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Applying this approach, there is no room for the implication of any term into the Term Sheet regarding the transfer of the OOB Sichuan shares held by the second plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 First, since the SSP Agreement, the parties had been dealing with the question of how the transfer of the shares should be effected.  As already mentioned, express reference is made to the purchase of OOB Sichuan shares in the Term Sheet.  As such, it is quite clear to me that the parties clearly contemplated the gap in the Term Sheet, in that it did not expressly deal with the transfer of the OOB Sichuan shares, but elected to leave the gap present in the agreement.  This is obvious from the fact that the Term Sheet, in its own words, described itself only as “summariz[ing] the terms for the restructuring of the amounts owing by the [first defendant] to Tembusu” without reference to the transfer of the shares.  The obligation to pay the moneys was intended to be separate and not contingent on the obligation to transfer the shares.  <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> at [95] is particularly instructive in this regard:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, scenario (a) [where the parties did not contemplate the issue at all and so left a gap] is the only instance where it is appropriate for the court to even <span class="font-italic">consider</span> if it will imply a term into the parties’ contract …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is therefore not open to this Court to imply a term into the Term Sheet, given the clear evidence that parties did contemplate the issue of the transfer of shares when they executed the Term Sheet, but chose to leave it silent on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Second, it is not at all clear what specific term can be implied given that there is no evidence that the parties were in consensus, at the time of the execution of the Term Sheet, as to the terms of such transfer.  Many issues appear to be unresolved.  For example, would the OOB Sichuan shares be transferred without any condition that the transferred shares should be charged to the plaintiffs?  Would the transfer of all the shares take place straight away once a method of transfer which complied with the NEEQ regulations was identified, or would the plaintiffs be required to procure a transfer only after full payment of the Outstanding Amount?  Would the shares be transferred in small batches, and if so, when?  Other issues left unaddressed went towards questions of whether the amount which had to be transferred from the first defendant to the plaintiffs before the transfer was effected was the full Outstanding Amount, or only the portion of the Outstanding Amount, which stemmed from consideration for purchase of the OOB Sichuan shares under the Share Transfer Agreement.  These are just some of the many unanswered questions.  This underscores the Court of Appeal’s observation at [101(c)] of <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied.  This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. <span class="font-italic">If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap </span><span class="font-italic">persists and the consequences of the gap ensue</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added in italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The instant facts appear to be such a situation where “the gap [in the Term Sheet] persists and the consequences of the gap ensue”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 These uncertainties probably explain why the parties did not plead or submit on the viability of an implied term in the Term Sheet relating to the transfer of the OOB Sichuan shares.  At the time of the trial, the parties appeared to still be in a state of limbo where the OOB Sichuan shares were “stuck” with the plaintiffs and could not be transferred for no consideration under the NEEQ regulations.  That being the case, it is really up to the plaintiffs and the first defendant to work with their Chinese lawyers and other advisers to come up with an agreed method for the transfer of the OOB Sichuan shares that complies with the NEEQ regulations, and is reasonably acceptable to the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Are the plaintiffs estopped from enforcing the Term Sheet?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on promissory estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The law on promissory estoppel is fairly well-established, and all parties are in agreement that in order to successfully raise promissory estoppel as a defence, the defendants had to prove the following elements (see for example <span class="font-italic">Nanyang Medical Investments Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Kuek Bak Kim Leslie and others </span>[2018] SGHC 263 at [140]; <span class="font-italic">Oriental Investments (SH) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Catalla Investments Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 1 SLR 1182 at [83]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, there must be a clear and unequivocal representation by the promisor, whether by words or conduct, that it will not enforce its strict legal rights;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, the promisee must act in reliance on the promise and suffer detriment as a result; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, it must be “inequitable” for the promisor to resile from his promise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Further, the party asserting the estoppel must properly plead the representation that it is relying on.  In particular, details such as when and where the representation took place, who it was spoken by, and the content of the representation should be made clear in order to give the party defending the estoppel allegation fair notice as to the case he has to meet: <span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon </span><span class="font-italic">Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased)</span> [2018] 2 SLR 799 at [49].  Further, in <span class="font-italic">Fundamental Investors Pte Ltd v Palm Tree Investment Group Pte Ltd</span> [2020] SGHC 73 at [79], the High Court found that the defendant shifted from its pleaded defence that the representation it relied on took the form of the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">words</span> to a fresh defence at trial of the representation having been by the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">conduct</span>.  Vincent Hoong J held this to be sufficient grounds in and of itself to reject the fresh defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The importance of properly pleading the details of the estoppel relied on was also explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 in the context of proprietary estoppel.  At [38], the Court of Appeal outlined the general rule that parties are bound by their pleadings and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties have decided not to put in issue.  This reflects the basic concern that a party seeking to resist the assertion of an estoppel should know the case that he has to meet, and that key details of the estoppel should be fully pleaded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis of the evidence on the question of estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The defendants’ pleaded case is that, on the day of the signing of the Term Sheet, 20 September 2017, the plaintiffs’ Messrs Ding and Wong and Ms Cecia Sheng had made oral representations by way of verbal assurances <span class="font-italic">in person</span> to both defendants that the Term Sheet was simply to give Tembusu’s investment committee “additional comfort”.

</div>  This plainly contradicted any alleged representation that had been made to him.  He then spoke to the first defendant, who then assured him that Mr Ding had promised the first defendant again that the Term Sheet would not be enforced.  Given the hearsay nature of this evidence, I find it to be of little value in deciding whether the plaintiffs had assured the second defendant at the time when the Term Sheet was signed that the document would never be enforced.  The second defendant did not himself speak to any of the plaintiffs’ representatives after he received the first draft of the Term Sheet from the first defendant up to the time he executed it on 20 September 2017.  He therefore could not provide any direct evidence of any purported representations from the plaintiffs in relation to the Term Sheet drafts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In contrast to the defendants’ rather malleable evidence, the plaintiffs’ evidence on the issue of the alleged representation was clear and consistent.

It would make no sense whatsoever for the plaintiffs to insist on the execution of the Term Sheet, which provided a new payment schedule and added security in the form of the Metro shares, and at the same time assure the defendants that such an agreement (and in particular the added security) was not worth the paper it was written on.  It is also illogical to say that the Term Sheet was just to appease Tembusu’s investment committee if it was truly intended to be a dead letter.

</div>  Mr Ding thought that the shares would be acceptable as security, but understood that the final decision lay with Tembusu’s investment committee.  He does not know whether his colleagues with the first plaintiff in Singapore carried out any due diligence on Metro.  As for Mr Lim, his evidence is that he did not think that the Metro shares were adequate security at all, but those shares were what the first defendant was prepared to offer, and having some security was better than having none at all.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 On balance, I do not think that the argument concerning due diligence on Metro makes much headway for the defendants on the issue of estoppel.  There may be many reasons the plaintiffs did not do any due diligence on Metro, such as the fact that they knew that a minority stake in Metro, a private limited company, could not be worth very much.  The point really is that this stake in Metro was what was offered by the first defendant when the plaintiffs demanded some security.  The plaintiffs were prepared to accept the offer, since it was obviously better than having no security at all, other than the OOB Sichuan shares they still held.  It is a stretch to say that the failure to do due diligence on Metro can <span class="font-italic">somehow </span>evidence a shared intention not to enforce the Term Sheet.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Finally, I note that the defendants’ conduct subsequent to the Term Sheet being executed is also completely inconsistent with them having received representations that the agreement would not be enforced.  The first defendant continued to make payments to the second plaintiff even after receipt of a letter from the plaintiffs’ lawyers on 28 February 2018 threatening to enforce the Term Sheet.  He did not reply to the plaintiffs to remind them of the alleged representation.  The first time that the first defendant even <span class="font-italic">raised</span> the issue of a representation and an estoppel was not even in the first version of the defence filed by the defendants in these proceedings.  It was raised <span class="font-italic">only</span> in the first defendant’s show cause affidavit dated 26 July 2018 when the plaintiffs applied for summary judgment against the defendants.  No explanation has been provided by the defendants for this delay in raising what would have been an obvious answer to the claim by the plaintiffs.  I can only conclude that the estoppel argument was an afterthought raised by the defendants to delay judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 For the above reasons, I find that the defendants have not discharged their burden of showing that the plaintiffs had made a representation that the Term Sheet would not be enforced.  As such, the defence of promissory estoppel fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first defendant’s counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The pleaded counterclaim by the first defendant is for damages arising from the plaintiffs’ breach of the SSP Agreement by failing to transfer the OOB Sichuan shares to him.  This claim is fundamentally flawed for several reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 First, as I have already found (at [80] above), the plaintiffs did not breach the SSP Agreement by failing to transfer the OOB Sichuan shares to the first defendant.  From the time of the execution of that agreement, the first defendant had dictated the mechanics of how the shares would be transferred to him.  He did not want them to be transferred to him at no consideration because doing so would affect the market price of OOB Sichuan shares.  The subsequent amendment to the NEEQ regulations in March 2017 effectively rendered clause 4 inoperable.  From the evidence, it is clear that the parties had agreed that the first defendant would come up with an acceptable way for all the OOB Sichuan shares to be transferred from the plaintiffs to him.

</div>
</div>  This was not done by the time the Term Sheet was entered into, and that agreement superseded the SSP Agreement.  In my view, it is entirely up to the parties now to come to a mutually acceptable way for the OOB Sichuan shares to be transferred to the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Second, in any event, when one analyses the first defendant’s evidence in more detail, it will be apparent that the first defendant’s real complaint is that he <span class="font-italic">lost a chance</span> to do a trade sale of OOB Sichuan, and <span class="font-italic">not</span> that there were an offer that was made to him at that time which he could not accept because he did not have the plaintiffs’ OOB Sichuan shares.  There are several problems with this.  For starters, the pleaded case is <span class="font-italic">not</span> that the first defendant had lost an opportunity to sell OOB Sichuan in a trade sale, but that there was a loss of profits <span class="font-italic">caused</span> by the failure to transfer the shares.

There is no evidence of any approaches by any interested party, or any suggested price or proposed terms.  There is also no documentary evidence adduced of any such matters.  Instead, all we have is the first defendant’s evidence that he was talking to some potential counterparties, but the talks could not progress because he did not have the majority shareholding in OOB Sichuan without the shares from the plaintiffs.

</div>
</div>  Given the limited state of the evidence raised by the first defendant in his AEIC (see [128] above), I am not satisfied that any purported breach by the plaintiffs can even be said to have caused the first defendant to have lost a chance to make a profit.  Even if I am mistaken on this, I am not satisfied that any chance lost was real or substantial, particularly given the absence of documentary evidence on these matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Finally, I am unable to see how the opportunity to sell OOB Sichuan in a trade sale can be said to be a loss that is a natural and probable consequence of the failure to transfer the plaintiffs’ OOB Sichuan shares pursuant to clause 4 of the SSP Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In <span class="font-italic">Out of the Box Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Wanin Industries Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 363 at [47], the Court of Appeal indicated that the assessment of whether a particular loss claimed was too remote involved ascertaining, in light of the defendant’s knowledge and the circumstances in which that knowledge arose, whether that loss would “have been considered by a reasonable person in the situation of the defendant at the time of the contract to be foreseeable as a not unlikely consequence that he should be liable for”.  On the facts, the first defendant has simply not established on the evidence that the plaintiffs knew or ought to have known that he was in negotiations with any specific interested party to sell away OOB Sichuan.  All that the Mr Lim and Mr Ding appeared to be aware of was that the first defendant hoped to effect a trade sale, not that there was any realistic possibility of one.

</div>  In my judgment, the damages sought by the first defendant in its counterclaim are too remote.  The requirement that loss caused is not too remote must be assessed in light of the entirety of the circumstances, and is not satisfied simply because a <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> had previously been raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 For the above reasons, I find that there is no merit to the first defendant’s counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133  For all the above reasons, I allow the plaintiffs’ claim and dismiss the first defendant’s counterclaim.  As such, I order the first defendant to pay the sums of RMB 30,025,000 and S$4,410,000 that are due under the Term Sheet to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The plaintiffs are also entitled to interest on the sums at [133] at the rate of 5.33% from the date of the writ until the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 As for the Metro shares, the Term Sheet quite clearly evinces the parties’ intention that the first defendant’s 13.8% beneficial shareholding in Metro is to be made available as security for the payment of the Outstanding Amount.   As such, I find that the Term Sheet has the effect of creating an equitable charge over the 13.8% of Metro beneficially owned by the first defendant.  As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">SCK </span><span class="font-italic">Serijadi Sdn Bhd v Artison Interior Pte Ltd</span> [2019] 1 SLR 680 (“<span class="font-italic">SCK</span>”) at [22]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A]n equitable charge may arise whenever property is “expressly or <span class="font-italic">constructively</span> made liable, <span class="font-italic">or </span><span class="font-italic">specially appropriated</span> to the discharge of a debt or some other obligation” … Yet, the paradigmatic example of a “charge” is that it is an instrument which creates security for a debt – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an instrument which gives a creditor a right to resort to certain property in the event of a default of repayment. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">National Provincial and Union Bank</span><span class="font-italic"> of England v Charnley</span> [1924] 1 KB 431, Atkin LJ remarked (at 449 – 450):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not necessary to give a formal definition of a charge, but I think there can be no doubt that where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property … shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Further, at [25] of <span class="font-italic">SCK</span>, the Court of Appeal specifically observed that<span style="color: rgba(31,73,125,1)">:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where the equitable charge is used to create security for repayment, the creditor is usually given the right to resort to the property or have it sold <span class="font-italic">if the debt is unpaid</span> … [U]pon default the creditor gains an accrued right to resort to the charged property for satisfaction of the debt …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original, citations omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The question then is whether having the right to “resort” to the Metro shares includes being able to seek an order for the Metro shares to be “delivered up” by having the physical share certificates handed over.  I am of the view that it does.  In <span class="font-italic">Beale</span><span class="font-italic"> et al on The Law of Security and Title-based Financing</span> (3rd Ed., Oxford University Press) at [18.33], the authors suggest that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]here are a number of ways an equitable mortgagee or chargee can obtain possession. The most usual is by an express power to take possession … Possession can be taken with the consent of the mortgagor or charger, <span class="font-italic">or by an order of the court</span>, either directly for possession or for the appointment of a receiver who will have the power to take possession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is therefore open to the court to make an order for the chargee to be handed possession of the share certificates.  In any event, the defendants have also accepted in their submissions that it is open to the court to make an order for the “delivery up” of the 13.8% of Metro owned by the first defendant should the Court adopt the plaintiffs’ interpretation of the Term Sheet.
