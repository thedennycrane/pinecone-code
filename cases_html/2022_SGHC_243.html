</div> The respondent submitted that the Post was not defamatory as the respondent did not specify in the Post that the appellant had provided a defective battery to him. The respondent further argued that an ordinary reader would have drawn the inference that there may have been other reasons for his car issues since he stated that the battery was functioning properly after the appellant’s installation and the issues only surfaced after ten days.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I noted that the Post began with the respondent stating that he had engaged the appellant for car battery replacement service, that things were alright initially and that there were issues with the audio system and roof lights of his car ten days later. In my view, it would be clear to the ordinary reader that the respondent was suggesting that the issue was with the battery. This was fortified by the respondent’s further statement in the Post that he called the appellant, who had provided the battery, to “come [and] check” the connections. I therefore found that the natural and ordinary meaning of the Post was, as pleaded by the appellant, that: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the respondent was still facing issues with his car’s battery after the appellant’s battery replacement; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) upon the respondent’s request for further assistance, the appellant informed the respondent that he would definitely be charged for the service; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) this was a breach of the warranty by the appellant. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The test of whether words are defamatory is whether the words tend to lower the appellant in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally: see [5] above. This test has been adopted in defamation cases involving businesses: <span class="font-italic">WBG Network (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Meridian Life </span><span class="font-italic">International Pte Ltd and others</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 727 (“<span class="font-italic">WBG Network</span>”) at [42]; <span class="font-italic">Golden Season</span> at [131]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I found that the Post was defamatory to the appellant. It did suggest some degree of unfairness and unreasonableness on the part of the appellant in seeking to charge the respondent despite the promise of warranty. In the eyes of an ordinary and reasonable reader, such an allegation would lower the reputation and standing of the appellant’s business, as compared to other businesses providing similar car battery replacement services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I then turned to examine if the defences of justification and fair comment applied in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Justification</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The respondent submitted that in his correspondence with the appellant, there was a mention of a charge for the appellant’s on-site attendance. This caused the respondent to believe that attendance by the appellant would be chargeable.

</div>
</div> This was therefore unlike the cases of <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock Peter</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Seng Mark v Phan Ying Sheng</span> [2021] SGHC 145 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Seng</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Lim Eng Hock</span><span class="font-italic"> Peter</span>, the appellant was a prominent businessman and investor. The defamatory statements suggested that the appellant had caused the club’s financial losses through mismanagement for his own benefit. These statements were published in an “Explanatory Statement” by the club to its 17,000 members. The court awarded $140,000 as general damages and $70,000 as aggravated damages. In <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Seng</span>, the respondent was a social media content creator in the motorcycling and travel industry, who had between 40,000 to 50,000 followers on her Facebook page at the material time. The court awarded $25,000 in general damages and $15,000 in aggravated damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 While the Post was published in the FB Groups that had a total of around 178,000 members, the number of members alone was not determinative of the extensiveness of the publication. This was because not all members check the posts in their Facebook groups. In <span class="font-italic">Koh Sin Chong Freddie v Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 629, the court held that although the club had 10,000 members, only a modest percentage of members would have seen the defamatory content which was contained in minutes posted on the club’s notice board: at [48].  In this case, the Post on SGCASMG gathered 12 reactions and 85 comments.

</div> This was far lower than the defamatory Facebook post in <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Seng </span>which garnered 346 reactions, 575 shares and 125 comments. In <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Seng</span>, the court accepted the number of reactions, shares and comments as a rough indicator of the number of persons who would have the read post: at [87]. I accepted the appellant’s submission that not all who viewed the post may have reacted to it. However, there was no evidence of the number of people who viewed the Post, and even if the number of people who viewed it was several multiples of the number of people who reacted to it, the number would still be very far from the total number of members, which was 178,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I found that the appellant did establish malice. The appellant expressly informed the respondent that it would only charge the respondent if the issues with his car were unrelated to the battery, to which the respondent replied “ok lah, fair enough lah”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Record Of Appeal (Vol IV Part B), at p 60.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> By his Post, the respondent was reckless about the truthfulness of what he posted. Even if the respondent was genuinely mistaken as to what the appellant had meant at the time of the publication, the respondent would have been clear about the appellant’s position in the course of the proceedings. Yet, the respondent refused to remove the Post or apologise to the appellant and maintained his defence of justification. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In totality, I was of the view that general damages should be assessed at $20,000.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>The respondent’s failure to apologise and refusal to retract the defamatory statement, as well as the presence of malice, justified a slight upward calibration of the general damages. At the same time, the publication here had much lower traction than that in <span class="font-italic">Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Khim Seng</span> and the victim there was an influencer who had 40 times the number of the appellant’s followers on Facebook and stood to suffer more harm to her reputation. The award of $20,000 was also consistent with those made in <span class="font-italic">TJ System</span> and <span class="font-italic">Golden Season</span>. Both <span class="font-italic">TJ System</span> and <span class="font-italic">Golden Season </span>involved less extensive publication, but the defamatory content of the statements in those cases was far more egregious. The allegations in <span class="font-italic">TJ System </span>were that of bribery, while the allegations in <span class="font-italic">Golden Season</span> were about the misuse of donors’ monies. The first plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Golden Season </span>was awarded $15,000 in general damages while the third plaintiff was awarded $30,000 in general damages and $20,000 in aggravated damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I found that aggravated damages were not applicable here. The courts have held that aggravated damages are not applicable for corporate entities because “[i]t is common understanding that aggravated damages are awarded for injury to feelings and pride in circumstances where the [defendant’s] conduct has aggravated the injury...”: <span class="font-italic">Golden Season</span> at [136]. Since companies cannot suffer injury to feelings, aggravated damages would not be applicable to corporate plaintiffs: <span class="font-italic">ATU</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v ATY </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1159 at [56]–[60]. The same principles should apply to partnerships. The Post pertained to the business practices of the appellant as a partnership. As a corporate entity, the partnership could not suffer injuries to feelings and pride from the Post. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Taking the above into consideration, I awarded the appellant $20,000 in general damages, with statutory interest from the time of the writ to the date of judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I also made the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the respondent remove each of the Post and all other defamatory statements from all online or other sources, including but not limited to SGCASMG, GSSG and SGCWG; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the respondent issue a written apology addressed to the appellant, which should be published in the SGCASMG, GSSG and SGCWG; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the respondent refrain from making any further such defamatory statement on all online or other sources, including but not limited to SGCASMG, GSSG and SGCWG.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I awarded costs to the appellant in the sum of $12,000 for the appeal plus disbursements in the sum of $5,478.60. For the hearing below, the costs in the sum of $12,000 plus disbursements incurred by the appellant in the sum of $1,705.40 were reversed in favour of the appellant.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"> </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Clarence Lun Yaodong, Cheston James Ow (Fervent Chambers LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Viveganandam Devaraj, M Nareindharan (Lion Chambers LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
