        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court Judge
                    (“the Judge”) in <em>The One Suites Pte Ltd
                        v Pacific Motor Credit (Pte) Ltd</em> [2014] 4 SLR 806
                    (“the GD”). We allowed the appeal and now give the
                    detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The dispute arose out of a contract for the sale and purchase of the remainder
                    of the lease over a property at 11 Leng Kee Road (“the
                    Property”). The Property was leased from the Housing and Development
                    Board (“the HDB”). The purchaser is The One Suites Pte Ltd
                    (“the Appellant”), a retailer of motor vehicles (except
                    motorcycles and scooters). Cheong Sim Lam (“Cheong”) is
                    the sole director and shareholder of the Appellant. The vendor (and lessee of
                    the Property) is Pacific Motor Credit (Pte) Ltd (“the
                    Respondent”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 27 July 2012, the Appellant exercised the option to purchase
                    (“OTP”). At that point in time, the Appellant had paid a
                    total sum of $1.68m (being 10% of the purchase price of the Property) to the
                    Respondent as deposit under cl 3(a) of the OTP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Clause 10 of the OTP provided that the Property was sold subject to
                    the “existing approved use” (also referred to as
                    “the Seven Uses” (see the GD at [65])). Further,
                    cl 12 of the OTP stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The sale and purchase herein is subject to the written approval from
                            the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) or such
                            other competent authority to the sale of the Property by the Vendor
                            being obtained and the parties hereto hereby covenant with the other of
                            them to comply with such relevant terms and conditions that may be laid
                            down or imposed by the HDB on them respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    In the event, the HDB refuses to approve the sale and purchase herein
                            the sale herein shall be rescinded and all moneys paid to account of the
                            purchase price herein shall be refunded free of interest compensation or
                            otherwise, ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    The Purchaser shall within two (2) weeks from the date of the exercise
                            of Option, apply or submit the relevant application to the HDB and all
                            other competent authorities (if applicable) for the necessary
                            approval(s). ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c.    For the avoidance of doubt, if the approval letter by the HDB is
                            subject to rectification of any unauthorised additions or alterations in
                            the Property, for the purposes of enabling completion, the Vendor shall
                            give the necessary undertaking to the HDB to attend to the rectification
                            within the deadline given by the HDB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After the OTP was exercised, KhattarWong LLP
                    (“KW”), the solicitors acting for the Appellant, wrote to
                    the HDB, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“the URA”) and
                    the National Environment Agency (“the NEA”) for their
                    respective approvals for the sale and purchase of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The HDB and the NEA replied and sought clarifications from the Appellant. On
                    16 August 2012, Gary Tak Seng Leong (“Leong”)
                    from the HDB sent an email to inquire as to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the proposed use of the Property and specifically asked for
                    a “business plan”. KW replied the following day stating
                    that the Appellant would be using the Property for the Seven Uses; but no
                    business plan was provided. On 21 August 2012, the NEA also sent a
                    letter to seek clarifications on a number of matters. At Cheong’s
                    request, his brother-in-law, Jason Tan, attended to all of the NEA’s
                    clarifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 27 August 2012, the URA replied to Cheong’s application
                    and stated that the Property was “approved for workshop, office and
                    showroom use”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In response to KW’s reply on 17 August 2012 (see above at
                    [6]), Leong from the HDB called for a meeting with the Appellant to enable him
                    to understand the Appellant’s business plan. KW then arranged for a
                    meeting between the Appellant and the HDB on 12 September 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 3 September 2012, KW responded to the NEA’s letter of
                    21 August 2012. KW informed the NEA that the Property would be used for
                    the Seven Uses and that it would furnish details of the business once they were
                    available. As KW’s response did not address the queries set out in the
                    NEA’s letter of 21 August 2012, Chen Fu Yi of the NEA sent an
                    email on 4 September 2012, requesting KW to “furnish [him]
                    with the necessary information required in the letter” so that he
                    could process the application. On 11 September 2012, KW supplied the
                    NEA with the Appellant’s responses to the queries raised in the
                    NEA’s email of 21 August 2012. On the same day, the NEA
                    notified the Appellant of the outcome of its application. The letter stated as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    We wish to inform you that under the URA Master Plan 2008, the long
                            term land use plan for the subject site at 11 Leng Kee Road is
                            for residential use, notwithstanding that it is currently being used by
                            industry at this juncture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    As your proposed uses (i.e. general motor workshop, store, showroom,
                            staff canteen, office and auxiliary purpose) do not conform to the long
                            term land use plan for the subject site, <em>we regret
                                that we are unable to support your application.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    Please source for alternative industrial premises, which is zoned for
                            B2 industrial use (ie. general/special) in the URA Master Plan. The
                            proposed industrial premises shall also be located at least 100m away
                            from residential premises and food industry. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 12 September 2012, the Appellant met with representatives from the
                    HDB. Leong, who represented the HDB at the meeting, testified that the
                    NEA’s non-approval of the Appellant’s application was never
                    brought up during the entire course of the discussion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 21 September 2012, KW wrote to inform Leong that the
                    “NEA’s consent has not been obtained” and sought
                    his confirmation on the status of the application for the HDB’s
                    approval. Three days later, on 24 September 2012, Leong wrote to inform
                    KW that that the HDB was “unable to grant in-principle
                    approval” because the “NEA’s consent has not
                    been obtained”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In light of the HDB’s response, KW wrote to Ching Ching, Pek
                    Gan &amp; Partners (“CCPG”), the
                    solicitors acting for the Respondent, on 25 September 2012 stating that
                    the transaction had been “rescinded” pursuant to
                    cl 12a of the OTP and that the sum of $1.68m should be refunded. CCPG
                    responded on 1 October 2012, rejecting the purported notice of
                    rescission and suggesting that the Appellant should: (a) revise its
                    proposed use to conform to the NEA’s requirement; and
                    (b) appeal on the basis that all the properties in the same stretch are
                    used for motor car related industry purposes and that it would be inequitable
                    for the NEA to refuse to grant its approval “especially when [the
                    Property] is to be used as a clean industry basis”. KW disagreed with
                    CCPG. In its letter of 5 October 2012, KW stated that the Property was
                    sold “subject to existing approved use”, <em>ie</em>, the Seven Uses, and not sold subject to only the
                    then existing use. KW also pointed out that the NEA had stated that the area was
                    zoned for residential use and that it therefore saw no errors in the
                    NEA’s decision which it could premise an appeal upon. KW concluded
                    that there was therefore no reason for the Appellant to either revise its
                    application or appeal against the NEA’s decision. CCPG replied on
                    8 October 2012 to say that the Respondent was “checking on
                    the matter with [the] NEA”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Respondent’s director, Tan Kah Tong
                    (“Tan”), met with two representatives from the NEA on
                    15 October 2012. On 19 October 2012, CCPG wrote to KW to
                    inform the Appellant that the NEA’s concern was with the fact that the
                    Property was zoned for residential use. CCPG also stated that the chances of
                    obtaining the NEA’s approval was “very high” if
                    the Appellant assured the NEA that there would be no change to the
                    Property’s existing use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     KW responded to CCPG’s letter on 22 October 2012 and
                    reiterated its view that there were no reasonable grounds for the Appellant to
                    appeal against the NEA’s non-approval of its application. In its
                    letter, KW asked for the Respondent to repay the $1.68m deposit paid by the
                    Appellant pursuant to cl 12a of the OTP. On 1 November 2012,
                    KW issued a formal notice and demanded the return of the $1.68m deposit. KW
                    repeated its demand on 6 November 2012. CCPG responded on the same day
                    stating that it would take instructions from the Respondent and that it would
                    respond to the demand within the next seven days or so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Tan then wrote to the NEA on 8 November 2012, urging it to review the
                    matter and to reconsider its refusal to approve the Appellant’s
                    application. He asked the NEA to grant its approval with the express
                    qualifications that the Property was to remain zoned for residential use and
                    that there was to be no change to the “existing use” of
                    the Property. On 23 November 2012, the NEA sent an email to inform
                    Cheong that the NEA (together with the HDB and the URA) had jointly assessed his
                    appeal and had decided to accede to it by approving the sale and purchase of the
                    Property. The letter, which was attached to the email, stated that the NEA
                    (together with the HDB and the URA) had noted the Appellant’s
                    “declaration and confirmation” that it was taking over the
                    Property “without any change of use” and that it had
                    “in-principle no objection” to this. KW wrote to the NEA
                    on 28 November 2012 to inform it that neither the Appellant nor KW had
                    lodged any appeal with the NEA and to “reject the representations,
                    unauthorized appeal and [the] NEA’s purported decision”. On
                    29 November 2012, Tan sent a letter to the Appellant requesting the
                    Appellant to, in light of the NEA’s approval, apply to the HDB for its
                    approval of the sale and purchase of the Property. CCPG sent a similar letter to
                    KW the next day. KW replied on 11 December 2012 and stated that the OTP
                    had been terminated and could not be retrospectively revived by the
                    NEA’s letter on 23 December 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Judge took the view that the dispute revolved around cll 4 and 12
                    of the OTP (see the GD at [45]). He found that a problem arose from the clauses,
                    namely that the OTP could remain in force indefinitely if the relevant
                    authorities “remained silent” after applications for the
                    approval of the sale and purchase of the Property were made to them (see the GD
                    at [49]). This was because the OTP only stipulated that the completion was
                    contingent on the grant of the HDB’s approval (see Cl 12(a),
                    reproduced above at [4]) without fixing any cut-off date for the granting of
                    that approval (see the GD at [49]). To resolve the problem, the Judge applied
                    the three-step test for the implication of terms laid down in <em>Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another
                        appeal</em> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<em>Sembcorp Marine</em>”). He refused to imply a cut-off date
                    as it was impossible to identify any particular date as the cut-off date; there
                    was no basis to prefer one date over another (see the GD at [62]). Instead, he
                    found (at [63]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... there was an implied term that the Purchaser had to use all reasonable
                        endeavours to obtain the written approval of HDB and such other competent
                        authority to the sale of the Property within a reasonable time. If no such
                        approval was forthcoming within a reasonable time after the exercise of all
                        reasonable endeavours, either party may give notice to rescind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Judge found that the HDB’s email of 24 September 2012
                    was “not a clear and unequivocal rejection” of the
                    Appellant’s application which would trigger cl 12a of the
                    OTP. He found that it was merely a statement by the HDB that it could only
                    process the Appellant’s application after the NEA’s approval
                    was obtained (see the GD at [70]). In his view, the key question was whether all
                    reasonable steps had been taken to obtain the NEA’s approval (see the
                    GD at [71]). He accepted that the NEA’s letter on
                    11 September 2012 “looked like a clear and unequivocal
                    rejection” of the Appellant’s application (see the GD at
                    [76]). He also found that the Appellant did not take any steps to try to change
                    the NEA’s mind or to clarify the NEA’s decision; this was in
                    spite of the fact that the rejection appeared to be inconsistent or unreasonable
                    (see the GD at [79]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the facts, the Judge found that the Appellant knew that there were
                    realistic prospects of success if it had appealed against the NEA’s
                    decision and that the Appellant ought to have done so (see the GD at [91]). But
                    the Appellant refused to do so because it had lost interest in the transaction
                    and was looking for an opportunity to rescind the OTP (see the GD at [92]).
                    Accordingly, he held that the purported rescission of the OTP by the Appellant
                    on 25 September 2012 was premature, and therefore invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Even though the Judge found that the OTP had not been rescinded, he refused to
                    make the declarations sought by the Respondent (which were essentially
                    declarations to compel the Appellant to proceed with the sale and purchase of
                    the Property). He also refused to award damages because the Respondent had not
                    adduced <em>any</em> evidence of its losses (see the GD at
                    [109]). He nevertheless allowed the forfeiture of the sum of $1.68m on the basis
                    that it was not an advance payment but, instead, was paid as security for the
                    Appellant’s performance of its obligations under the OTP (see the GD
                    at [117]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The issue before us was whether the OTP was rescinded by virtue of the
                    HDB’s email on 24 September 2012 pursuant to cl 12a
                    such that the Appellant was entitled to recover the sum of $1.68m paid to the
                    Respondent under the OTP. This, in turn, depended on:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the HDB had refused to approve the sale and purchase of the
                        Property; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     if so, whether the Appellant was obliged to use reasonable endeavours to
                        persuade the HDB to change its mind after it had refused to approve the sale
                        and purchase of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the HDB had refused to approve the sale and purchase of the
                Property </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We start with the characterisation of the HDB’s email on
                    24 September 2012. As mentioned earlier, the Judge found that the HDB
                    had not refused to approve the sale and purchase of the Property. We
                    respectfully disagree. In our view, the email dated 24 September 2012
                    indicated that the HDB was unable to grant the in-principle approval because one
                    of the prerequisites for granting the in-principle approval (<em>ie</em>, the NEA’s approval) could not be satisfied. It is
                    pertinent to note that, at that point in time, the NEA had unequivocally
                        <em>refused</em> to grant its approval (see above at
                    [9]). The fact that the NEA had subsequently decided to reverse its decision by
                    granting its approval after Tan had made certain concessions on behalf of the
                    Appellant (see above at [15]) demonstrated that the NEA did not approve in the
                    first place. We also noted that the concessions made by Tan on behalf of the
                    Appellant, which led to the subsequent approval, required the Appellant to take
                    over the Property subject to the then “existing use”. In
                    doing so, Tan had undercut the contractually agreed Seven Uses (see above at
                    [4]) which entitled the Appellant to utilise the Property beyond the scope of
                    its then “existing use” and which appeared to be crucial
                    to the Appellant since it affected how the Appellant could have used the
                    Property in the future (see above at [6] and [9]). The subsequent approval was
                    therefore wholly irrelevant, and with respect, the Judge seemed to have been
                    unduly influenced by it (as well as by the Appellant’s inaction
                    thereafter). More importantly, the fact that the HDB might have been willing to
                    reconsider the Appellant’s application if the Appellant had
                    subsequently obtained the NEA’s approval did not mean that the HDB had
                    not refused to give its approval. The Appellant had written to the HDB on the
                    status of its application, and the HDB had refused to approve it. A look at the
                    HDB’s email to the Appellant on 24 September 2012 from an
                    objective perspective would reveal that the refusal was clear and unequivocal.
                    Our finding in this regard led us to the next question, <em>ie</em>, whether the Appellant was obliged to use reasonable
                    endeavours to persuade the HDB to change its mind after it had refused to grant
                    its approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Appellant was obliged to use reasonable endeavours to
                persuade the HDB to change its mind after it had refused the Appellant’s
                application </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is not controversial that, in a case where the sale of land is
                    “subject to the approval” of the authorities (as in this
                    case), there is usually an implied obligation to use reasonable endeavours to
                    obtain the requisite approvals of the relevant authorities. There appears,
                    however, to be some uncertainty as to whether the obligation should <em>invariably</em> extend to taking further steps after any
                    particular requisite approval has been refused. We did not think so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The issue before this court was a straightforward one. It was primarily one
                    concerning the <em>application</em> of the relevant
                    principles on “endeavours” clauses laid down by this court
                    in <em>KS Energy Services Ltd v BR Energy (M) Sdn Bhd</em>
                    [2014] 2 SLR 905 (principles which concern <em>express</em> “endeavours” clauses but which are
                    equally applicable to an <em>implied</em>
                    “endeavours” term) to the facts at hand. To this end, it
                    bears reiterating that one of the important principles mentioned in that
                    decision that whether or not an obligation to use reasonable endeavours is
                    satisfied is, at bottom, a <em>fact-centric</em> exercise.
                    The present case is no exception. However, this case did raise a closely related
                    (and no less important) point: the contours as well as content of the obligation
                    to use reasonable endeavours are also determined, where relevant, with regard to
                    the <em>express</em> terms of the contract itself. This
                    must surely be the case because it is axiomatic that an implied term <em>is subject to and cannot contradict</em> an express term of
                    the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In light of the above, it is clear that one would have to have regard not only
                    to the actual actions taken (and <em>not</em> taken) by the
                    Appellant pursuant to its attempt to discharge its obligation to use reasonable
                    endeavours to secure the HDB’s (or any other relevant
                    authority’s) approval, but also to the precise facts which tell us
                    what the precise point in time is when that particular obligation is in fact
                        <em>discharged</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Turning first to what the Appellant had done, we noted that it was clear that
                    the Appellant had addressed all the clarifications sought by the NEA (see above
                    at [6]). This culminated in the rejection of the Appellant’s
                    application by the NEA <em>via</em> the
                    11 September 2012 letter (set out above at [9]). This last-mentioned
                    rejection by the NEA in turn resulted in the <em>refusal</em> of the Appellant’s application by the HDB
                        <em>via</em> its 24 September 2012 email (a
                    decision that was clearly premised upon the NEA’s decision). Up to
                        <em>that</em> particular point in time, it could
                        <em>not</em>, in our view, be said that the Appellant
                    had <em>not</em> used reasonable endeavours. The question,
                    therefore, was whether or not the Appellant was under any obligation to
                        <em>continue</em> to use reasonable endeavours
                        <em>thereafter</em>. In this regard, <em>the refusal</em> by both the NEA <em>and</em>
                    the HDB are of the first importance, having regard to <em>the
                        express terms</em> of the contract itself – in particular,
                    cll 12(a) and 12a thereof, which are set out above (at [4]) and which
                    we reproduce again as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) The sale and purchase herein is <b>subject to the
                            written approval from the Housing and Development Board

                        to the sale of the Property by the Vendor being obtained and the parties
                        hereto hereby covenant with the other of them to comply with such relevant
                        terms and conditions that may be laid down or imposed by the HDB on them
                        respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a. In the event, <b>the HDB refuses to approve

                        exchange for the Purchaser’s return to the Vendor’s
                        Solicitors of all documents of title and the withdrawal by the Purchaser at
                        the Purchaser's cost of all caveats and cancellation of all entries relating
                        to the Property at the Singapore Land Authority as may relate to the sale
                        and purchase herein, neither party to have any claim or lien against the
                        other whatsoever thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In our view, cll 12(a) and 12a are clear and unambiguous. The
                    combined effect of both these sub-clauses is that once the HDB <em>refuses to approve</em> the sale and purchase, that refusal
                    brings the OTP to an end; the refusal of the HDB simultaneously constitutes the
                    cut-off point beyond which no further efforts are required to be undertaken by
                    the Appellant pursuant to its duty to use reasonable endeavours. As already
                    mentioned (see above at [23]), these <em>express</em> terms
                    must prevail. Put simply, they determine the <em>content</em> as well as the <em>metes and
                        bounds</em> of the implied term on the part of the Appellant in the
                    present case to use reasonable endeavours to secure the approval for the sale
                    and purchase of the Property from the NEA as well as the HDB. To insist, as the
                    Respondent had, that the Appellant must – pursuant to the implied term
                    just referred to – engage in actions that <em>contradict</em> the <em>express terms</em> of
                    the contract itself is simply wrong as a matter of legal principle. It would
                    also undermine the purpose behind cl 12a which, in our view, must have
                    been to eliminate the possibility of a dispute when the requisite approval has
                    been refused, and to allow parties to have a clean break (see also the English
                    High Court decisions of <em>Lipmans Wallpaper Ltd v
                        Mason &amp; Hodghton Ltd and another</em> [1969]
                    1 Ch 20 (“<em>Lipmans Wallpaper
                        Ltd</em>”<em>)</em> and <em>Bickel and others v Courtenay Investments (Nominees) Ltd</em>
                    [1984] 1 All ER 657 (“<em>Bickel</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     However, the Judge held that the HDB had <em>not</em>
                    refused to approve the sale and purchase of the Property, and as a result, the
                    contract had <em>not</em> been rescinded pursuant to
                    cl 12a. He observed thus with regard to cll 12(a) and 12a (see
                    the GD at [49]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was, however, a problem in these clauses. Under the express
                        contractual framework, the time for completion was contingent on the grant
                        of HDB’s approval but the OTP did not specify any time limit for
                        such approval to be obtained, or a long stop date for the determination of
                        the contract. It put no obligation on the Purchaser to pursue the relevant
                        approvals beyond the submission of the applications. The end result was that
                        if the Purchaser had simply sat on his hands after making the applications,
                        and the relevant authorities remained silent, the OTP could continue
                        indefinitely. I note that cl 15 of the Conditions of Sale allowed
                        for the parties to issue a notice to complete but that, again, may only be
                        given after the completion date. The parties would find themselves in
                        limbo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the circumstances, the Judge was of the view that it was necessary to
                        <em>imply</em> a term in order to give the OTP
                    efficacy. He then proceeded to observe (and conclude) as follows (see the GD at
                    [50]–[64]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    The question then is whether the court should intervene, and if so,
                            how. I am guided by the Court of Appeal in <em>Sembcorp
                                Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd [2013] 4 SLR
                                193</em> (“<em>Sembcorp
                                Marine</em>”), which laid down a three-step test
                            for implication of terms in fact (at [101]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the
                                contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court
                                discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate
                                the gap.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is
                                necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in
                                order to give the contract efficacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be
                                implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the
                                need for business efficacy, would have responded ‘Oh, of
                                course!’ had the proposed term been put to them at time of
                                the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response,
                                then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap
                                ensue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    As for the first step, the Purchaser argued that there was no gap in
                            the OTP requiring the implication of any terms by this court on the
                            basis that both parties were represented by solicitors during the
                            drafting and signing of the OTP. I disagreed. I was disappointed that a
                            contract drafted and negotiated by solicitors for such a large
                            transaction contained such a glaring gap. In any event, even the most
                            well-meaning drafter of contracts cannot anticipate every eventuality.
                            Similarly, the existence of negotiations does not <em>ipso facto</em> mean the parties contemplated the gap and
                            chose to leave it as it is.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    As for the second step, it is clear for the reasons I have stated that
                            it was necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in
                            order to give the OTP efficacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    This brings me to the third step. It seemed to me the real issue was
                            how the gap should be filled.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54    The Defendant submitted that the OTP contained two implied
                            terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a) that it was incumbent upon the Purchaser to act with
                                due diligence and despatch and take all reasonable and necessary
                                steps that were and/or are necessary to facilitate and expedite the
                                procurement of the written approval of HDB or such other competent
                                authority for the sale of the Property by the Vendor under and in
                                accordance with cl 12(a) of the OTP; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b) that the Purchaser and Vendor would co-operate with
                                each other and do all reasonable and necessary things to effect the
                                consummation and completion of the sale and purchase of the
                                Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55    The Purchaser disputed this. However, it accepted that, in order for
                            the Purchaser to have the benefit of cl 12a and rescind the
                            OTP, it had to show that it had exercised all reasonable endeavours to
                            secure written approval from HDB. It had formulated this on the basis
                            that this was the “plain and ordinary meaning of the language
                            of cl 12a”. It did not seem to me that this was a
                            plain reading of the clause at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56    Nevertheless, the Purchaser could hardly have disputed that it did
                            have this obligation, based on the authority of <em>Tan
                                Soo Leng David v Wee, Satku &amp; Kumar Pte
                                Ltd [1997] 3 SLR(R) 257</em> (“<em>Tan Soo Leng David (HC)</em>”). It was
                            stated by Judith Prakash J at [61]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">61    It is established law that where a contractual provision provides
                                that performance by one party is subject to the consent of a third
                                party, the first party cannot say that having asked for such consent
                                thereafter the matter is completely out of his hands so that if the
                                consent is not forthcoming he is released from further performance.
                                Rather, as the Court of Appeal put it in this case, <b>to avail himself of the right to rescind, such party
                                    has a duty to show that he has taken all reasonable steps to
                                    obtain the consent of the third party or that it was useless for
                                    him to pursue the matter with the third party after the initial
                                    withholding of consent because it would have been quite
                                    impossible for him to obtain the consent of the third
                                    party</b>. ... [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57    Having set out the foregoing, the difference between the
                            parties’ positions was not obvious at first glance. It
                            appeared to me that, based on the Purchaser’s interpretation
                            of cl 12a, any failure to take all reasonable steps would only
                            operate to <em>disentitle</em> his right to
                            rescission, while the Vendor’s implied terms would create
                                <em>positive</em> obligations on the Purchaser
                            such that it would be in breach of contract if it failed to do so.
                            Assuming this was the Purchaser’s position, this would not
                            cure the gap that I have identified. If the Purchaser failed to take all
                            reasonable steps, it cannot rescind, but there would still be no way
                            forward. We return to the problem of when completion should take
                            place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">58    The Purchaser also submitted that “on the plain
                            wording” of cl 4(a), the OTP provided that the
                            completion date ought to have been 19 October 2012 <em>at the very latest</em>. Therefore, if the Purchaser
                            failed to obtain approval from HDB by the Alleged Completion Date, even
                            if there was no express refusal, it would be entitled to rescind if it
                            had exercised all reasonable endeavours by then. Once HDB refused to
                            grant its approval, cl 4 of the OTP ceased to operate, with the
                            result that cl 12a of the OTP operated to entitle the Purchaser
                            to rescind the sale and purchase of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">59    I disagreed. The plain wording of cl 4 indicated that the
                            Alleged Completion Date was the <em>earliest</em>
                            possible completion date rather than the <em>latest</em>. Clearly, it must be possible for the relevant
                            approval by HDB to occur after the date of approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60    In this respect, the Purchaser submitted that this court should also
                            draw guidance from <em>Tan Soo Leng David (HC)</em>
                            at [62] where, after analysing the relevant clause in that case, the
                            learned judge found that the natural and ordinary meaning of that clause
                            was that the sale and purchase would be <em>immediately</em> rescinded in two instances. First, if the
                            third party refused to give its consent, and secondly, if the third
                            party did not respond to the request for consent for such a long period
                            that its consent had not been received by the completion date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61    However, the clause in question in <em>Tan Soo Leng
                                David (HC)</em> expressly stated that where such consent was
                            not forthcoming by the completion date, the sale and purchase of that
                            property shall be deemed to be rescinded (see [12]). That clause
                            stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">The sale shall also be subject to the consent of the Developers,
                                which said consent to the sale is required under the terms of the
                                principal agreement. <em>In the event such consent is
                                    refused or not received by the Completion Date (as defined in
                                    Clause 7 below), the sale and purchase herein shall be deemed
                                    rescinded</em> forthwith whereupon all moneys paid
                                hereunder shall be refunded to you free of interest and subject
                                thereto the sale and purchase herein shall be cancelled and of no
                                effect and neither party shall have any claim or demand against the
                                other for damages, costs, compensation or otherwise. [emphasis
                                added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">62    Clause 12a of the OTP did not contain such a stipulation. In
                            effect, the Purchaser was asking the court to <em>imply</em> a cut-off date for pursuing all reasonable
                            endeavours. In my view, had the need for a cut-off date been brought to
                            the parties’ attention at the time of contract, they would
                            have said “Oh, of course!” (as specified in the
                            third step of the <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> test
                            (see [50] above)). But it was impossible for a court to specify an exact
                            date as it would have no basis to prefer one date over another.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">63    Having regard to the foregoing, I found that there was an implied term
                            that the Purchaser had to use all reasonable endeavours to obtain the
                            written approval of HDB and such other competent authority to the sale
                            of the Property within a reasonable time. If no such approval was
                            forthcoming within a reasonable time after the exercise of all
                            reasonable endeavours, either party may give notice to rescind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64    In any event, based on the Purchaser’s own argument, the
                            implication of the Alleged Completion Date as the cut-off date for the
                            exercise of all reasonable endeavours would not assist the Purchaser.
                            They had not taken any further steps in pursuance of the relevant
                            approvals after KW’s e-mail to HDB on 21 September
                            2012. Indeed, that is generous, since an e-mail which merely informed
                            HDB that NEA had refused to give its approval could more reasonably be
                            construed as an invitation for HDB to follow suit than an attempt to
                            convince HDB to give its consent. Accordingly, if it was not entitled to
                            rescind when it purported to do so on 25 September 2012, the existence
                            of a long stop date made no difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     With respect, there were a number of problems with the Judge’s
                    analysis set out in the preceding two paragraphs. For a start, we respectfully
                    differed from the Judge’s view (see the GD at [49], and reproduced
                    above at [27]) that the express terms of the contract “put no
                    obligation on the Purchaser [the Appellant] to pursue the relevant approvals
                    beyond the submission of the applications”. This view completely
                    ignored cl 12(a) which states that the parties must comply with the
                    terms and conditions that may be laid down or imposed by the HDB –
                    this would cover situations where the HDB grants a <em>conditional</em> approval. Apart from that, it was clear that there
                    is an implied term that the Appellant would use reasonable endeavours to obtain
                    the requisite approvals. The steps that must reasonably be taken to satisfy this
                    obligation would depend on <em>all the facts and circumstances of
                        the case itself.</em> In these circumstances, we did not see how the
                    OTP could “continue indefinitely”. We noted that the
                    Appellant was obliged to make the requisite applications within <em>two weeks</em> from the exercise of the OTP (see
                    cl 12b reproduced above at [4]) and this meant that the circumstances
                    would not likely have changed dramatically such that the Appellant would have,
                    at the time of the applications, lost interest in the transaction. It is also
                    pertinent to note that the Appellant had, at that particular point in time, paid
                    a total of $1.68m as deposit, and the only way for the Appellant to recover that
                    sum under the OTP was for the HDB to refuse to approve the transaction. The
                    point is that once the HDB responds with an approval, a conditional approval
                        <em>or</em> a refusal (or, for that matter, any sort of
                    clarification), that would have resolved the matter. It appeared to us that the
                    Judge had arrived at the view that he did only because he failed to acknowledge
                    that the HDB had refused to approve the Appellant’s application. In
                    light of the refusal by the HDB, it was not difficult to see why the Appellant
                    did not think that it had to take any further steps (and hence, it appeared to
                    the Judge as though the Appellant had “sat on his hands”
                    (see the GD at [49])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Judge was clearly concerned – and rightly in our view
                    – with establishing a <em>temporal cut-off
                        point</em> in order to ascertain whether or not the duty to use
                    reasonable endeavours had been fulfilled. We were of the view that there were
                    two ways of ascertaining such a cut-off point. If there was <em>an express term</em> stipulating when that cut-off time would be (for
                    example, upon the refusal by the authorities and/or the lapse of a certain
                    period of time), that would resolve the issue. If there was no such express
                    term, then a term might be <em>implied</em> to the effect
                    that the requisite approval would need to be obtained (here, by the Appellant)
                    within <em>a reasonable time</em> (and <em>cf</em> the Judge’s own view in the GD at [63]). What would
                    constitute a reasonable passage of time in this last-mentioned regard would
                    depend on all the facts and circumstances of the case. Indeed, it would appear
                        <em>difficult</em> to determine this particular issue
                        <em>apart from</em> the more general (and central)
                    issue of whether or not the relevant party (here, the Appellant) had indeed used
                    reasonable endeavours to obtain the approval in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Returning to the facts of the present case, it was clear – as has,
                    in fact, already been pointed out above – that there <em>was an express term</em> stipulating what the relevant
                    cut-off point is. That cut-off point would be arrived at <em>when
                        the HDB refused to give its approval</em> – at which point
                    the contract would be rescinded and the Appellant would be entitled to recover
                    all moneys paid to the Respondent. That would be the end of the matter. There
                    was no need – as the Judge thought – to imply a term in the
                    present case. Indeed, as we have also pointed out above, it would be wholly
                    inappropriate to imply such a term in any event as it would be <em>inconsistent with</em> the <em>express
                        terms</em> of the contract itself. Put another way, there was
                    (contrary to what the Judge held (see the GD at [51], reproduced above at [28]))
                        <em>no gap</em> within the meaning of <em>the first step</em> as set out by this court in <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> at [101] – and which was in
                    fact also cited and applied by the Judge (see the GD at [50], reproduced above
                    at [28]). As this first step (which is a <em>threshold</em>
                    one) had not been fulfilled, that was, once again, an end to the matter and no
                    further consideration of any implication of a term could arise (pursuant to the
                    next two steps of <em>Sembcorp Marine</em> (and see, once
                    again, the GD at [50], reproduced above at [28])). Indeed, the <em>second step</em> in <em>Sembcorp Marine could

                    reproduced above at [28])), <em>ex hypothesi</em>, be
                    satisfied as it was clearly <em>un</em>necessary in the
                    business or commercial sense to imply a term <em>as the parties
                        had already provided for the situation concerned by way of an express
                        term.</em> As a result, there was no need to proceed to the third
                    – and final step – set out in <em>Sembcorp
                        Marine</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the circumstances, it is not necessary to go on to address the remaining
                    analysis of the Judge, except in so far as he had relied on the observations of
                    the High Court in <em>Tan Soo Leng David v Wee,
                        Satku &amp; Kumar Pte Ltd and another</em>
                    [1997] 3 SLR(R) 257 (“<em>Tan Soo Leng David
                        (HC)</em>”) at [61]. Indeed, this would, in our view, be an
                    appropriate juncture to consider these observations as the Judge had (as we
                    shall see) utilised them in a somewhat different fashion. Although they have
                    already been set out in the GD, it bears setting these observations in <em>Tan Soo Leng David (HC)</em> (at [61]) out in full again
                        (<em>together with</em> the next paragraph ([62])), as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61    It is established law that where a contractual provision provides that
                            performance by one party is subject to the consent of a third party, the
                            first party cannot say that having asked for such consent thereafter the
                            matter is completely out of his hands so that if the consent is not
                            forthcoming he is released from further performance. Rather, as the
                            Court of Appeal put it in this case, <b>to avail himself
                                of the right to rescind, such party has a duty to show that he has
                                taken all reasonable steps to obtain the consent of the third party
                                or that it was useless for him to pursue the matter with the third
                                party after the initial withholding of consent because it would have
                                been quite impossible for him to obtain the consent of the third

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The court in <em>Tan Soo Leng David (HC)</em> did refer
                    to this court’s decision in the earlier proceedings (in <em>Tan Soo Leng David v Wee, Satku &amp; Kumar
                        Pte Ltd and another</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 426
                        (“<em>Tan Soo Leng David
                    (CA)</em>”)). That was an appeal against the decision to strike
                    out the statement of claim – the appeal was allowed, and the matter
                    went for trial and that gave rise to the decision in <em>Tan Soo
                        Leng David (HC</em>). This court in <em>Tan Soo Leng
                        David (CA)</em> agreed with the reasoning of Denning LJ (as
                    he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Brauer &amp; Co (Great Britain), Ltd v James Clark
                        (Brush Materials), Ltd</em> [1952] 2 All ER 497
                        (“<em>Brauer</em>”), who had
                    opined (at 501) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in order to enable them [the sellers] to take advantage of it they
                        must show that, notwithstanding that all reasonable steps were taken by
                        them, they could not obtain a licence to export during any part of the
                        shipment period, or, alternatively, that it was useless for them to take any
                        such steps, or any further steps, because it was quite impossible for them
                        to obtain a licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     
          <em>Brauer</em> was, in fact, a case which concerned a
                    shipping contract which included a clause that the “contract is
                    subject to any Brazilian export licence”. The sellers were obliged to
                    secure the export licence. However, it turned out that the export licence would
                    only be issued if the goods were shipped at a minimum price. The sellers did not
                    meet that requirement, and failed to perform the contract. It was not a case
                    where an application was made but consent was withheld. It follows that
                    Denning LJ could <em>not</em> have been
                    contemplating a situation where a party had to use reasonable endeavours even
                        <em>after</em> consent had been refused and, hence,
                    could <em>not</em> have been laying down any <em>normative rule or principle to that effect</em>. Indeed, it
                    would have been contrary to the position in England that, in the context of an
                    assignment of a lease subject to the consent of the landlord, the lessee (who
                    was obliged to use reasonable endeavours to obtain the landlord’s
                    consent) may rescind the contract once consent has been refused, regardless of
                    whether such refusal was reasonable or otherwise: see, for example, the English
                    Court of Appeal in Chancery decision of <em>Lehmann v
                        McArthur</em> (1868) LR 3 Ch App 496; as well as the English
                    High Court decisions of <em>Lipmans Wallpaper Ltd</em> and
                        <em>Bickel</em>. More importantly,
                    Lord Denning MR had, in the subsequent English Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Hargreaves Transport Ltd v Lynch</em>
                    [1969] 1 WLR 215, held that, on the facts of <em>that</em> case, it was not reasonable to expect the party to appeal
                    against the refusal of a planning permission even though there was a formal
                    appeal procedure available. It is also noteworthy that other cases have found,
                    on their facts, that the obligation to use reasonable endeavours would extend to
                    an appeal against the refusal to grant a planning permission (see, for example,
                    the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>IBM United Kingdom
                        Ltd v Rockware Glass Ltd</em> [1980] FSR 335 and the English High
                    Court decision of <em>Jolley v Carmel Ltd</em> [2000]
                    2 EGLR 154 (affirmed in <em>Jolley v Carmel
                        Ltd</em> [2000] 3 EGLR 68)). This further illustrates our
                    point that there could <em>not</em> be a rule or
                    proposition that a party must <em>invariably</em> use
                    reasonable endeavours even after consent had been refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Indeed, we do not think that this court in <em>Tan Soo Leng
                        David (CA)</em> could have understood <em>Brauer</em> differently. After citing <em>Brauer</em>, this court in <em>Tan Soo Leng David
                        (CA)</em> then proceeded to observe as follows (at [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… So <em>also</em>, in our view, there was
                        a duty on the first respondents to show that they had taken all reasonable
                        steps to obtain the second respondents’ consent or <em>that it was useless for them to pursue the matter with the
                            second respondents after the initial withholding of consent because it
                            would have been quite impossible for them to obtain the second
                            respondents’ consent</em>. This is a question of fact
                        which could not be decided on the affidavit evidence, such as it was, and
                        the matter has to go to a full trial for this question to be decided ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is clear that this court in <em>Tan Soo Leng David
                        (CA)</em> was merely reiterating the statement made by
                    Denning LJ in <em>Brauer</em> (reproduced above at
                    [33]) which, as we understand it, means that there is no need to show that
                    reasonable steps had been taken <em>prior</em> to the
                    refusal if it can be shown that it would have been useless to do so. It could
                    not have meant otherwise as the contract in that case expressly stipulated that
                    the contract is “deemed rescinded” if the requisite
                    consent was refused (see <em>Tan Soo Leng David (HC)</em>
                    at [12]). It might not have been wrong to consider the steps taken after the
                    refusal on the particular facts of <em>Tan Soo Leng David
                        (HC)</em> given that very little was done before the refusal to obtain
                    the requisite consent. It was <em>not</em> a case where
                    there was an application followed by a clarification (like in the present case),
                    but was a case where the consent was sought merely by way of a simple letter
                    stating that the proposed sale was to the plaintiff who was “an eye
                    specialist” (see <em>Tan Soo Leng David
                        (HC)</em> at [63] and [65]). However, the events that transpired
                        <em>after</em> the refusal revealed that it was quite
                    impossible to obtain the consent <em>in the first
                        place</em> even if reasonable steps were taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In our view, therefore, neither this court in <em>Tan Soo Leng
                        David (CA)</em> nor the court in <em>Tan Soo Leng David
                        (HC)</em> was laying down a normative rule or proposition which ought
                    to be applied universally in other cases in the future. In particular, as we
                    have already emphasised, the duty to use all reasonable endeavours is a
                        <em>fact-centric</em> one and the observations just
                    referred to were made in <em>Tan Soo Leng David (HC) in the
                        context of the particular facts of that case.</em> As already alluded
                    to above, it appeared, however, that the Judge thought that such a normative
                    legal rule or proposition was indeed being laid down in that case. This probably
                    prompted him to apply what was stated in <em>Tan Soon Leng David
                        (HC)</em> to the facts of the present appeal as a legal rule or
                    principle. In our view, <em>the factual observation in Tan Soo
                        Leng David (HC) cannot be transformed into a wholly different kind (ie,
                        normative) of proposition which would then apply to all other cases (such as
                        the present)</em>.The court in <em>Tan Soo Leng David
                        (HC)</em> made the observations (at [61]) it did and therefore held as
                    it did by reference to (<em>only</em>) <em>the particular facts before it</em>. The observations and decision
                    therefore did <em>not</em> apply to other cases such as the
                    present – with each case having to be examined by reference to their
                    specific contractual terms as well as facts. In the context of the present
                    appeal, however, the <em>express terms</em> are clear and
                    (as already explained above), based on the relevant facts read in connection
                    with the relevant express terms of the contract, the Appellant had (for the
                    reasons set out above) clearly discharged its duty to use reasonable endeavours
                    and was entitled to regard the contract as rescinded once the HDB had refused to
                    approve the application on 24 September 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For completeness, we should also briefly discuss two other Singapore High
                    Court decisions which have dealt with an issue that is similar to the one before
                    us. We begin with the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Group
                        Exklusiv Pte Ltd v Diethelm Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2003]
                    4 SLR(R) 582 (“<em>Group
                    Exklusiv</em>”). Like the present case, <em>Group Exklusiv</em> involved the sale and purchase of a property
                    which was leased from the HDB. The plaintiff was obliged under the contract to
                    apply for the approval from the NEA for the change of use of the property.
                    Clause 15(e) of the contract provided that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the consent of HDB, LTA and other relevant authorities in respect of
                        the sale and purchase and the change of use and the erection of the private
                        access road is <em>not obtained or refused by the date
                            falling one (1) month before the date fixed for completion</em>,
                        the sale and purchase may, at either party’s option, be rescinded,
                        whereupon all monies (including but not limited to the deposit and goods and
                        services tax, if any) paid by the Purchaser herein shall be refunded to the
                        Purchaser without any interest or compensation. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The NEA had informed the plaintiff in that case that the property could be
                    used as a vehicle showroom, but could not be used for spray painting and vehicle
                    repair. Consequently, the plaintiff gave notice of rescission, but the defendant
                    did not accept it and refused to refund the deposit. The court held (at [9])
                    that the letter from the NEA constituted a “clear and unequivocal
                    rejection” of the plaintiff’s application for change of
                    use. Having done so, he went on to consider whether the plaintiff was obliged to
                    appeal or to take further steps to persuade the NEA to change its mind, and
                    found that the plaintiff had expended reasonable efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We appreciate that, as a matter of prudence (and perhaps strategy), counsel
                    would almost always feel obliged to adduce evidence and make submissions on the
                    point that there should or should not have been further endeavours after the
                    refusal. Indeed, the evidence on the futility of further endeavours after the
                    refusal <em>may</em> be relevant in certain cases, for
                    example, where the refusal was not as clear or unequivocal or where there is an
                    appeal procedure available. However, as we have mentioned earlier, in a case
                    where the parties have <em>expressly</em> provided for
                    rescission upon the refusal of the requisite consent (as in the present case),
                    the <em>implied</em> obligation to use reasonable
                    endeavours could not extend beyond the point of refusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We proceed to consider the second case, the Singapore High Court decision of
                        <em>Ong Khim Heng Daniel v Leonie Court Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2000] 3 SLR(R) 670 (“<em>Leonie
                        Court</em>”). The plaintiffs, who were the majority owners
                    of Grenville Condominium, agreed to sell the property <em>en
                        bloc</em> to the defendant. The sale was subject to the approval of
                    the Strata Titles Board (“the STB”). The contract provided
                    that the plaintiffs would use their “best endeavours” to
                    apply and obtain the requisite approval (cl 7A), and if the STB did not
                    approve the sale, the monies paid should be refunded to the defendant
                    (cl 8(c)). The plaintiffs made their first application to the STB and
                    approval was not granted as certain procedural requirements were not met. The
                    STB did <em>not</em> decide on the merits of the
                    application. The defendant gave notice to rescind the contract and asked for the
                    refund of the deposit. One of the issues was whether the agreement allowed for
                    only one application to be made. The court considered (at [18]) that there was
                    nothing in cll 7A and 8(c) which stipulated or implied that the
                    plaintiffs must obtain the STB’s approval on the first application. At
                    first blush, this case appears to suggest that further steps must be taken even
                    after the STB had refused (notwithstanding cl 8(c) which states that
                    the monies paid shall be refunded if the STB does not approve of the sale).
                    However, the better view is that no application was properly made due to the
                    procedural irregularities and it follows that there could not have been a
                    refusal by the STB which would suffice for the purpose of cl 8(c).
                    Indeed, this coheres with the court’s view expressed (at
                    [22]–[23]), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    The plaintiffs submitted that when cl 8(c) refers to the
                            Board not approving a sale, it contemplates a decision made taking into
                            account the matters listed in ss 84A(7) and 84A(9) that the
                            Board is obliged to consider. It argued that the Board's decision of
                            2 June was not such a decision as it did not consider the
                            substantive aspects of the proposed sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    That is a valid point. The Board had not ruled definitively on the
                            application. The Board had not considered the merits of the matter. The
                            plaintiffs had attempted to get the Board to consider their application,
                            but the Board had not really considered the application yet and had not
                            decided whether the sale should be approved or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In light of the above analysis, it is clear that neither <em>Group Exklusiv</em> nor <em>Leonie Court</em>
                    stands for the proposition that the obligation to use reasonable endeavours to
                    obtain the consent of a third party would <em>invariably</em> extend to taking further steps after consent had been
                    refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     To summarise, the courts will usually imply an obligation to use reasonable
                    endeavours to obtain the consent of the third party in a case where the contract
                    is a subject to the consent of a third party. However, the question of whether
                        <em>that</em> obligation had been satisfied will
                    ultimately depend on the precise facts and circumstances of each case. In that
                    regard, it is important to bear in mind that the scope of the obligation to use
                    reasonable endeavours is to be determined, where relevant, with regard to the
                        <em>express</em> terms of the contract itself. If the
                    contract provides for rescission upon the refusal by the third party, then there
                    can be no implied obligation to use reasonable endeavours after there has been
                    such a refusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Given our analysis and decision, there is no need to consider the further
                    question as to whether or not there is a duty on the part of the parties to
                    cooperate (which the Respondent contends should be implied into the contract).
                    Indeed, although most courts are in agreement that the seminal decision with
                    regard to this particular duty is that of the House of Lords in <em>McKay v Dick and another</em> (1881) 6 App Cas 251,
                    the precise legal <em>basis</em> might be debatable (given
                    the different views expressed in the case itself). The precise content and scope
                    of that duty have also not been considered by this court, although it has been
                    considered in the Singapore High Court in a few cases (most notably and
                    (relatively) recently by V K Rajah J (as he then was)
                    in <em>Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 634 (“<em>Evergreat</em>”)). Since <em>Evergreat</em>, there have also been developments across the
                    Commonwealth (including Singapore) with regard to the doctrine of <em>good faith</em>. Indeed, one key issue is what the <em>relationship</em> is (if any) between the duty on the part of
                    contracting parties to cooperate on the one hand and the doctrine of good faith
                    on the other. In this regard, though, we note that the present position in
                    Singapore as set out in the decision of this court in <em>Ng Giap
                        Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and others</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 518 (“<em>Ng Giap
                    Hon</em>”) is that there is <em>no</em>
                    implied duty of good faith based on a “term implied in <em>law</em>”. However, this court in <em>Ng Giap Hon</em> was prepared to leave open the possibility
                    that such a duty could be implied by way of the <em>narrower</em> category of “terms implied in <em>fact</em>”. Whilst it is thought in some quarters
                    that the English High Court decision in <em>Yam Seng Pte Ltd v
                        International Trade Corporation Ltd</em> [2013]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 526 heralded a more expansive approach towards
                    the doctrine of good faith, a close analysis of the judgment itself (especially
                    at [131]) suggests that the English position is not that much different from the
                    existing Singapore position in <em>Ng Giap Hon</em>
                    (reference may also be made to the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust v Compass Group UK and
                        Ireland Ltd (trading as Medirest)</em> [2013] EWCA Civ 200, especially
                    at [105]). It might also be usefully noted that this court in <em>HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Ltd (trustee of Starhill
                        Global Real Estate Investment Trust) v Toshin Development Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2012] 4 SLR 738 held that where there is an
                        <em>express</em> term in the contract that the parties
                    would <em>negotiate in good faith</em>, this would be given
                    effect to. However, the law in this particular sphere (<em>viz</em>, good faith) continues to be in a state of flux. For
                    example, the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Harish Bhasin v Larry
                        Hrynew and Heritage Education Funds Inc</em> [2014] SCC 71 recently
                    held that there is a duty of <em>honest performance</em>
                    which is, in turn, a manifestation of the general organising principle of good
                    faith. Whether or not the formulation in this last-mentioned decision is too
                    vague and general is a question which is (fortunately) outside the purview of
                    the present appeal – as is the (more specific) issue as to whether or
                    not the implied term of mutual trust and confidence ought to apply in the
                        <em>employment</em> context such that a term ought to
                    be implied in <em>law</em> that neither party will, without
                    reasonable cause, conduct itself in a manner that is likely to destroy or
                    seriously damage or undermine the relationship of trust and confidence between
                    employer and employee (this principle being first established in the leading
                    House of Lords decision of <em>Malik v Bank of
                        Credit &amp; Commerce International SA (in compulsory
                        liquidation)</em> [1998] AC 20, which was, however, <em>not</em> followed in the recent High Court of Australia decision in
                        <em>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Barker</em> (2014)
                    88 ALJR 814 (with the position in Singapore still left open for
                    decision in a future case (see the decision of this court in <em>Wee Kim San Lawrence Bernard v Robinson &amp; Co
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2014] 4 SLR 357))). It will be
                    immediately seen from this very short synopsis of the various issues why the
                    question as to whether or not there is a duty on the part of the parties to
                    cooperate and, if so, what its scope is and what its relationship is to
                    doctrines such as good faith, are all matters that ought best to be decided in a
                    definitive fashion only when they next come directly for decision before the
                    courts.</p>
