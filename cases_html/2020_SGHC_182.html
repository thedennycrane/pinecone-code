In these proceedings (which were filed on 22 November 2018), the plaintiffs sued the two defendants for alleged breach of a sale and purchase agreement dated 17 September 2014 (“the SPA”).  This was an agreement in which each of the defendants agreed to purchase from the plaintiffs 17.5 million shares in a publicly listed company called PSL Holdings Limited (“PSL”) (“the PSL shares”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 According to the plaintiffs, the total consideration to be paid for the 35 million shares was $10.5 million; and completion of the sale and purchase was to have taken place on 17 October 2014 – but the defendants “wrongfully failed to and/or neglected to and/or refused” to complete the transaction, though the plaintiffs “were willing, ready and able to complete” the transaction at “all material times”

The defendants alleged that these were false representations which the first plaintiff had made with the intention of inducing the defendants to sign the SPA; and that the defendants had been induced by these misrepresentations to sign the SPA.  The defendants asserted that they were entitled to rescind the SPA due to these fraudulent misrepresentations; alternatively, that they were entitled to counterclaim against the first plaintiff loss and damages allegedly suffered as a result of these misrepresentations.  Alternatively, the defendants asserted that the SPA had been “rescinded by mutual agreement” in October 2014, and/or that the plaintiffs were “estopped from relying on their legal rights under the [SPA], if any”

However, I noted that in refusing to admit the authenticity of the two copies of the SPA, the defendants did not actually deny that the signatures on the last page of each copy were their signatures.  Indeed, no allegation of forgery or fabrication was pleaded by the defendants.  The defendants themselves had on 24 October 2014 obtained a copy of the SPA from M/s Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP (“Rodyk”), the law firm which prepared the SPA

In coming to this conclusion, I noted that the Rodyk partner overseeing the matter – one Low Chai Chong (“Mr Low”) – had apparently signed as a witness on both copies of the SPA exhibited in the first plaintiff’s AEIC

It is also not disputed that prior to the signing of the SPA on 17 September 2014, the first plaintiff had met with Tedy Teow (“Teow”) and had spoken with him about the sale of PSL shares.  The defendants asserted that their interest in purchasing PSL shares arose solely because Teow was interested in purchasing agarwood (a type of timber).  The second defendant claimed that sometime in early September 2014, he had – at Teow’s request – spoken with the first plaintiff over the telephone after one Bernard Lim informed Teow that the first plaintiff had a business proposal to make concerning the supply of agarwood

</div>.  Moreover, the parties were agreed that the 35 million shares to be sold pursuant to the SPA would not have been enough to enable the defendants to achieve a “reverse takeover” of PSL.  PSL being a publicly listed company, it would not have been difficult for Teow and/or the defendants to verify the total number of shares issued by PSL and thus the number of shares required to achieve a “reverse takeover”: the first plaintiff would have had no way of knowing whether they would conduct such checks.  In the circumstances, I was of the view that even if the notion of a “reverse takeover” of PSL had been mentioned during the telephone call between the first plaintiff and the second defendant, it was unlikely that the first plaintiff would have so boldly <span class="font-italic">represented as a fact</span> the defendants’ ability to achieve a “reverse takeover” of PSL with the number of shares he was selling them.  As I alluded to at [13] earlier, it seemed likely that in speaking to Teow and subsequently to the second defendant, the first plaintiff must have suggested PSL as an appropriate vehicle for facilitating the purchase of the Myanmar agarwood – should the defendants gain control of it.  It also seemed likely that he must have talked up the large number of shares he could sell them to aid an attempt at gaining control.  However, the evidence fell short of proving that he must further have <span class="font-italic">represented as a fact</span> their ability to gain control via a “reverse takeover” <span class="font-italic">solely with the shares he was selling them</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The signing of the SPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Following the telephone conversation between the first plaintiff and the second defendant, Bernard Lim informed the defendants that the first plaintiff had arranged for Singaporean lawyers to prepare an agreement for the sale and purchase of the PSL shares and to represent the defendants in the matter.

Their evidence of the Rodyk meeting was completely at odds with the defendants’ account of the meeting, in which – according to the defendants – the first plaintiff had spoken at length on how they would achieve a “reverse takeover” of PSL with the shares they were buying from him and how they would be able to nominate directors to the PSL board once they effected the takeover

</div>, I accepted that these notes were authentic and genuine.  The notes of the meeting were recorded by hand in a notebook and sandwiched between other handwritten notes about unrelated matters.  It did not appear to me likely that Carrie would have falsified an entire notebook just for the purpose of enabling the defendants to introduce into evidence a few pages of notes.  Indeed, it was not put to Carrie in cross-examination that she must have fabricated or falsified the notes.  <span class="font-italic">However</span>, whilst I accepted the authenticity of her notes of the meeting, these notes merely showed that there was some reference to matters such as a reverse takeover during the meeting.  These notes did not actually prove that the first plaintiff had made the alleged representations of fact during the meeting.  In this connection, I would reiterate the observations I made at [16].  I would also add that given the weighty consequences of the alleged representations about a reverse takeover of a publicly listed company, if they had indeed been made in all seriousness by the first plaintiff, it would have been extremely odd for Mr Low and Alvin to take no note at all of such representations.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As to the alleged representation regarding the first plaintiff’s beneficial ownership of all the shares to be sold, whilst the preamble to the SPA did refer to the “Vendors” as “the legal and/or beneficial owner [of] 35,000,000 ordinary shares of [PSL]”, I did not think that the defendants were induced by such a statement to enter into the SPA.  I would reiterate the observations I made at [15]: namely, that given that PSL was a publicly listed company and not some closely-held private company, there was no reason why the defendants should have found it so important to chase down the real beneficial owner(s) of the shares being sold under the SPA.  Moreover, as Mr Low pointed out in his testimony, it was the first plaintiff who would need to arrange for the transfer of the shares, either by presenting the requisite documentation at the Central Depository or by getting a broker to arrange for a married deal

Whilst the first plaintiff would likely have exaggerated what an attractive buy the PSL shares were, “mere praise by a man of his own goods or undertaking is a matter of puffing and pushing and does not amount to representation”

</div>.  I did not think it believable that the first plaintiff would have made such bold and specific representations as to what the price of PSL shares would be following a reverse takeover.  In any event, a statement as to the future price of the PSL shares – being a statement as to a future state of affairs – “can in itself be neither true nor false”, since “the future cannot be foretold”: per Saville J in <span class="font-italic">Bank Leumi </span><span class="font-italic">le Israel BM v British National Insurance Co Ltd</span> [1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 71 at 75.

As such, even if the first plaintiff had made statements about the future price of PSL shares, such statements would not have amounted to actionable representations.  In the interest of completeness, I should add that having regard to the defendants’ pleaded case and the evidence available, there was also no basis for me to find any representation by the first plaintiff that he possessed an “honest belief … based on reasonable grounds” that the future price of PSL shares would “turn out as forecasted” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Wan</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Johnny Lian Tian Yong</span> [2018] SGHC 169 at [260]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I also did not find it believable that the first plaintiff would have promised the defendants he would “arrange for the issuance or transfer of additional PSL shares” to them “for no additional cost”

</div>.  I did not accept this argument.  In my view, bearing in mind the large number of shares which the defendants were purchasing under the SPA, I did not think it unreasonable or improbable that they would have agreed to pay a premium above the market price.  After all, as a matter of common sense, if they had attempted to purchase 35 million shares in the market, it was highly unlikely that they would have been able to acquire all 35 million shares at one go, or for that matter, all 35 million shares at $0.17 per share.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I should stress that while I did not find the evidence sufficient to prove the specific misrepresentations pleaded by the defendants, I did not believe the first plaintiff’s assertion that he had never spoken with the defendants about getting control of PSL and/or using PSL as the vehicle for acquiring agarwood from Myanmar.  As I alluded to earlier (at [12]), it appeared to me the first plaintiff had latched on to Teow’s interest in acquiring agarwood to present to him – and the defendants – a proposal for how a supply source for agarwood could be secured using PSL as the vehicle.  If (as the first plaintiff claimed) the defendants had simply wanted to come up with a story about misrepresentations in order to justify repudiating the SPA, there was simply no need for them to come up with a complicated story involving diverse elements such as the acquisition of agarwood and the takeover of PSL.   Carrie’s notes of the Rodyk meeting (which I found to be authentic and genuine) also supported the inference that there was some mention of a reverse takeover of PSL during the meeting.  I reiterate that in my view, and having regard in particular to the premium which the defendants were paying, the first plaintiff would very likely have talked up how the shares he was selling them would aid them in any attempt to gain control of PSL – just as he would very likely have talked up the possibility of an upside to the PSL share price.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 On the other hand, the defendants were quite open about not having checked up on the size and composition of PSL’s shareholding <span class="font-italic">prior to</span> entering into the SPA.  In the circumstances, while I accepted that they appeared to have thought the 35 million shares would enable them to effect a reverse takeover of PSL, it seemed to me possible – perhaps even likely – that this impression resulted from their own misunderstanding or misapprehension of the discussions with the first plaintiff.  At any rate, as I have noted, the evidence was just not enough to prove that the first plaintiff had made the specific misrepresentations pleaded, or that the defendants were induced by these alleged misrepresentations to enter into the SPA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I should add that in respect of the second plaintiff, the parties were agreed that the defendants never met her and that she was not present at the Rodyk meeting on 17 September 2014.  Mr Low testified that she was brought to the Rodyk office by the first plaintiff on 18 September 2014 and that she signed the SPA in his presence

Locally, these have been summarised in a number of High Court judgments.  In <span class="font-italic">Kensteel Engineering Pte Ltd v OSV Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 253 (“<span class="font-italic">Kensteel</span>”), for example, the plaintiff alleged, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that it was entitled to rescind its contracts with the defendant (its subcontractor for certain works on a project known as “the Conoco-Belanak Project”), assume responsibility for the defendant’s work, and recover the expenses and losses incurred.  The defendant argued that the contracts had simply been varied by agreement, as opposed to having been rescinded.  Andrew Ang JC (as he then was) found (at [43]) that “there was a rescission by mutual agreement or – in other words – a mutual abandonment of existing rights”: the plaintiff was able to take over the works which it otherwise would not have been entitled to, while the defendant was released from further performance of its obligations under the contract.  In so finding, Ang JC cited (at [42]) the following well-known passage from <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 29th Ed, 2004) at para 22-025:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a contract is executory on both sides, that is to say, where neither party has performed the whole of his obligations under it, it may be rescinded by mutual agreement, express or implied.  A partially executed contract can be rescinded by agreement provided that there are obligations on both sides which remain unperformed.  Similarly, a contract which has been fully performed by one party can be rescinded provided that the other party returns the performance which he has received and in turn is released from his own obligation to perform under the contract.  The consideration for the discharge in each case is found in the abandonment by each party of his right to performance or his right to damages, as the case may be.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The same passage from <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contract</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> (albeit this time from the 2008 edition) was also cited by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">Uncharted Business Pte Ltd v Asiasoft Online Pte Ltd</span> [2009] SGHC 188 (at [21]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the present case, it was clear that neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants had performed the whole of their respective obligations under the SPA.  As at 31 October 2014, the plaintiffs had yet to transfer any PSL shares to the defendants, and the defendants had yet to transfer any funds to the plaintiffs in payment of the total purchase price of $10.5 million.  Having considered the evidence, I found that there was in fact a rescission by mutual agreement of the SPA.  My reasons for arriving at such a conclusion were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No notice to complete served between October 2014 and May 2018</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Firstly, it was not disputed that prior to May 2018, the plaintiffs had never served on the defendants a notice to complete the sale transaction.  This was significant because the completion date had clearly been set at 17 October 2014 (clause 1.1 of the SPA); and pursuant to clause 7 of the SPA, “[t]ime shall be of the essence in this Agreement as regards all the times, dates and periods mentioned herein”. The failure to serve any notice of completion in the period post 17 October 2014 up till May 2018 supported the defendants’ assertion that by end-October 2014, the parties had agreed on “a rescission by mutual agreement or – in other words – a mutual abandonment of existing rights” (per <span class="font-italic">Kensteel </span>at [43]) under the SPA.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No evidence to support the alleged attempts by the first plaintiff to “chase” the defendants to complete the transaction under the SPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Secondly, whilst the first plaintiff claimed that he had “[o]ver the course of October 2014 to around May 2018 … <span class="font-italic">tried to contact the </span><span class="font-italic">[d]efendants both</span> <span class="font-italic">directly and indirectly</span> through either George Lim or Bernard Lim, to chase them to complete the [SPA]”

</div> [emphasis added], there was no evidence at all of any such communications – no emails, for example, and not even any text messages.  Assuming there had really been attempts on the first plaintiff’s part at “chasing” the defendants “both directly and indirectly” to complete the SPA transaction, it was inconceivable that he should not have been able to produce any evidence of such attempts.  As their relationship manager at UOB, the first plaintiff would have had the defendants’ contact details – as well as Carrie’s contact details.  Indeed the evidence showed that he was able to contact them directly during the period of October 2014 to May 2018.  Thus, for example, on 13 April 2016, he had emailed the first defendant directly (copying Carrie), to inform him that UOB had approved his request for credit facilities to the tune of $15 million

Moreover, the inflow of such substantial cash amounts would have shown the first plaintiff that the second defendant had access to sources of funding.

The entire story appeared to me to be a pack of lies.  It would appear even the first plaintiff realised how weak this story sounded – because he proceeded to trot out several new explanations for his apparent inaction prior to May 2018.  First, he said that there was a “conflict of interest” because he “can’t be seen as pursuing [his] clients to buy shares from … [him]”

As noted earlier at [31], the first defendant’s evidence in cross-examination was that he had discovered from “online checks” sometime between 17 October 2014 and 24 October 2014 that “[the plaintiff] was not one of the top 20 shareholders” of PSL

</div>.  In short, according to the first defendant’s version of events, sometime before his text message on 23 October 2014, the first plaintiff would already have been made aware that the defendants were at the very least reluctant to complete the agreement for their purchase of 35 million shares.  Yvonne’s evidence – that she had been told by the first plaintiff sometime around the completion date that there was “no deal” – appeared to me to support the first defendant’s version of events.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It should be added that the first plaintiff’s reply to the first defendant’s query (“<span class="font-italic">17,000,000 shares at $0.30 (last time 35,000,000)</span>”

As alluded to above, the first plaintiff’s position per his AEIC was that there had been “radio silence” from the defendants between 17 October 2014 and 22 October 2014.  However, if there really had been “radio silence” from the defendants during that period, one would have expected the first plaintiff to protest on 23 October 2014 that he had no idea what the first defendant’s query (“<span class="font-italic">The total need my boss help u how many share</span><span class="font-italic">?</span>”) was about.  That he responded to the query by suggesting a reduced number of shares supported the first defendant’s assertion that they had already spoken about cancelling the SPA prior to 23 October 2014 and that they had discussed reducing the number of shares when the first plaintiff indicated reluctance to cancel.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It should also be added that although the first plaintiff took the position in his AEIC that he did not agree to the SPA being amended to reduce the number of shares, in cross-examination he contradicted himself by claiming that he had actually been ready to agree to a reduced number.  He even claimed that this was what he had told Mr Low

Mr Low said nothing about having been told by the first plaintiff that he would accept any offer by the defendants to purchase “above 17 million” shares.  In fact, he was not even asked in examination-in-chief about such a conversation with the first plaintiff.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Other evidence relating to the first plaintiff’s own conduct also tended to support the defendants’ case regarding the rescission by mutual agreement of the SPA in late October 2014 – and conversely, to contradict the plaintiffs’ claims about having been ready to complete the agreement from October 2014 up till May 2018.  Thus, for example, although the plaintiffs claimed that the second plaintiff’s 9.755 million shares were to make up part of the 35 million PSL shares to be sold under the SPA

When questioned about this, the first plaintiff conceded that he had not even been aware at the material time that the number of PSL shares in his mother’s account had fallen below 9.755 million.  By way of an attempt at explaining his dealings in the shares in her account, he claimed that he was selling off some of her shares because he had promised to “buy [PSL shares] from Dr Currie Chiang and Tan [Seung Yuen] and Dr Chung”; that he needed to “make good [his] promise to them”

Moreover, even if he had intended to make up any shortfall in the number of his mother’s PSL shares by buying more shares from his private banking clients, he would have needed at least to keep track of the number of shares he was selling off from his mother’s account versus the number of shares left in that account.

Instead, much of the evidence available supported the defendants’ case of a rescission by mutual agreement of the SPA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Finally, this was a case where the first plaintiff’s story of his attempts to “chase” for completion of the SPA transaction was rife with material internal inconsistencies.  In this connection, I should make it clear that having had the opportunity to observe the first plaintiff in the witness stand over three days, I did not think the lamentable state of his evidence was the result of confusion and/or anxiety about testifying in court.  In the first place, whilst it would be natural for any witness to feel some anxiety about testifying in court, the first plaintiff did not strike me as being in any way cowed or intimidated by the occasion.  When he wanted to, he was capable of responding boldly, even defiantly, to defence counsel’s questions.  For example, when it was pointed out to him that his AEIC contained no mention of his asking Ng to contact the defendants, he told defence counsel that counsel “can call Charles Ng to come to Singapore”

Instead of answering a question directly, he would often stall by offering a response that failed to answer the question.  Then, when reminded of the question, he would offer multiple responses, only to disavow these responses by ending with the declaration that he did not know or did not remember.  For example, when he was asked whether he had spoken to Mr Low after 27 October 2014 about the completion of the sale and purchase, his first response was that he “was waiting for [the first defendant] to reply” to Mr Low’s email query about amending the SPA. When he was reminded of the question, he continued to talk about the first defendant (“I think there was no reply”).  When reminded yet again to answer the question, he first said he did not think he had spoken to Mr Low – only to negate that reply in the very next minute by declaring that he actually could not remember

I was satisfied as well that in coming to such an agreement, the first plaintiff and the first defendant were also acting on behalf of the second plaintiff and the second defendant respectively, with the latter two’s authorisation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Further, I accepted that the first defendant’s mention of future business opportunities did not amount to a binding promise by the defendants to provide the first plaintiff with any specific business deal.  From what I could see, the first defendant’s vague mention of possible future opportunities was really intended as a salve to any feelings of disappointment on the first plaintiff’s part.  This would explain why no details were given of any particular business opportunity, and why no timeframe or deadline for providing such opportunities was ever mentioned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 This did not mean that the first plaintiff would have been left entirely unmoved by the mention of possible future deals.

</div>.  It was telling that in terms of timing, the first plaintiff’s decision in early 2018 to pursue the enforcement of the SPA came about after the following two incidents.  First, a “hotel deal” relating to the Hatten Group which he had brought to Teow fell through, apparently because the latter made a lowball offer (“300 million they … want to buy 150 million, no deal”)

This concerns the plaintiffs’ claim for the entire difference between the price of $10.5 million for all 35 million PSL shares and the market price of the same number of shares as at the date of issuance of the writ.  I found the manner in which this claim was presented to be disturbing in its lack of candour and/or veracity.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In the Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs did not explain the basis on which they were making the claim in respect of all 35 million shares.  In his AEIC, the first plaintiff said that leaving aside his mother’s and Yvonne’s shares, he had reached an “oral agreement” with Tan SY in September 2014 “that approximately 15.51 million of [Tan SY’s] shares in [PSL] would constitute a part of the 35 million shares to be sold to potential buyers, i.e. the [d]efendants”

In particular, it was plain that neither of them had a common understanding with the first plaintiff as to the existence – and the terms – of any alleged “oral agreement”.  It was also plain that far from having “agreed to withhold legal action against [the first plaintiff] thus far” upon his agreeing “to take the [d]efendants to [c]ourt to enforce the [SPA]”, both Tan SY and Dr Chung had been content to leave the first plaintiff to handle the matter as he saw fit; and neither appeared to have even contemplated legal action against him.  This was such a drastically different picture from that presented by the first plaintiff that I could not help but question the basis upon which he had constructed the claim put forward in the present proceedings.
