<p class="Judg-Author">
        Quentin Loh J (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       There are two Originating Summonses before me,
                    one being OS No 808 of 2011 (“OS 808”) and the other, OS No 580 of
                    2011 (“OS 580”). In OS 808, Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance Company
                    Berhad (“P&amp;O Insurance”) is the Plaintiff while the Motor
                    Insurers’ Bureau of Singapore (“MIB”) is the Defendant.
                    P&amp;O Insurance was formerly known as the Pacific &amp; Orient Insurance
                    Company Sendirian Berhard. In OS 580, the positions are reversed where MIB is
                    the Plaintiff while P&amp;O Insurance is the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       These proceedings are mirror applications which
                    revolve around the essential question of whether P&amp;O Insurance, which
                    carries on business as an insurance company in Malaysia with no office in
                    Singapore, is liable to satisfy a Singapore judgement obtained by an injured
                    pillion rider (or by his estate in the event of his death), against its policy
                    holder who is the rider of the motorcycle, in a traffic accident which occurred
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This is in turn contingent upon the obligations
                    which P&amp;O Insurance has undertaken under a 15 September 1975 Agreement
                    (“Special Agreement”) with MIB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The following facts are not disputed. On 21
                    December 2005, Ravi a/l Mariappen (“Ravi”), a Malaysian, was
                    riding his Malaysian-registered motorcycle with Ganesan a/l Govindaraj
                    (“Ganesan”) riding pillion along Benoi Road, Singapore, when there
                    was a collision with a lorry driven by Mohammel Hoque Aminul Hoque (“the
                    lorry driver”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Ganesan, who was injured, commenced Suit No 460
                    of 2008 (“Suit 460”) against Ravi. The lorry driver was
                    subsequently added as a second defendant. On 27 July 2010, final judgment in the
                    sum of S$243,983.68 was entered in Ganesan’s favour. Liability was
                    apportioned with Ravi bearing 75% and the lorry driver bearing 25% of the blame
                    for the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Ganesan’s lawyers had notified MIB on 17
                    July 2008 that they had commenced proceedings against Ravi and that they had
                    informed P&amp;O Insurance, who had issued a policy dated 12 April 2005 to Ravi
                    in Malaysia, of this. However, P&amp;O Insurance had disclaimed liability on the
                    ground that Ravi had not taken out any insurance for pillion rider
                cover.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       MIB took the position that P&amp;O Insurance was
                    an “Insurer Concerned” under the Special Agreement that was
                    binding on P&amp;O Insurance and that the latter should settle the judgment
                    obtained by Ganesan. P&amp;O Insurance disagreed that it was an “Insurer
                    Concerned” and refused to settle the judgment. The parties therefore
                    commenced these proceedings seeking the court’s ruling on this and other
                    related issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relevant History of the Motor Insurers’ Bureau</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It bears repeating that the ubiquitous motor
                    vehicle, indispensable to modern life, has an unfortunate inherent capacity to
                    injure, maim or cause the death of other road users or pedestrians as well as
                    inflict property damage. All too often, more than one category of harm is
                    caused. Hence the enactment of social legislation, not long after the widespread
                    use of motor vehicles, to ensure that no vehicle is on the road without
                    compulsory insurance cover for personal injury or death to a third party arising
                    out of the negligent use of the vehicle: see the English Road Traffic Act of
                    1930 (c 43) (UK). The equivalent legislation in Singapore is the Motor Vehicles
                    (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed),
                    (“MV(TP)A”). Given the contractual nature of insurance, it would
                    be of no comfort to such a victim if, for one reason or another, the insurer was
                    entitled to deny liability or cover to the vehicle owner or driver it has
                    insured. This deficiency was addressed by the MV(TP)A which essentially provided
                    that an insurer who is entitled to avoid liability under the policy to indemnify
                    the vehicle owner and/or driver, must nonetheless first satisfy any judgment for
                    death or personal injury entered against its insured owner and/or driver. It is
                    then entitled to recover that sum from its insured. This allowed the victim,
                    provided it gave due notice of his claim, a direct cause of action against the
                    insurer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       However, there were still cracks through which
                    claims could fall through and victims were left without compensation. For
                    example, what if for one reason or another, there was no effective insurance
                    cover? What if the driver fled the accident scene and the victim was so severely
                    injured or even killed that the vehicle and its driver could not be traced? What
                    happens if the insurer became insolvent?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The first Motor Insurers’ Bureau was
                    established in England in 1946. It was a fund financed by all motor insurers in
                    the country to pay compensation to road traffic victims who were unable to
                    recover any compensation for their injuries or claims. This same model was
                    subsequently adopted in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Malaysia set up its Motor Insurers’
                    Bureau of West Malaysia, (“MIBWM”), in 1968 and it was based on
                    the English model. Singapore set up its Bureau in 1975 and it was based on the
                    MIBWM model.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     MIB is an independent public company
                    incorporated on 25 January 1975. It is set up and funded by all general
                    insurance companies and Lloyd’s Underwriters carrying on motor business
                    and operating in Singapore. Among its objects in its Memorandum of Association
                    (“MOA”) are, at clause 3:</p>

                            furtherance of its objects.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Article 13 of MIB’s Articles of
                    Association provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Every member shall be bound to further to the best of its ability the
                        objects, interests and influences of the Bureau and shall observe these
                        Articles and any regulations which may be promulgated from time to time for
                        the administration of the Bureau and any Agreements which may be entered
                        into between the Bureau and such member.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 22 February 1975, two agreements were
                    entered into:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, MIB entered into an agreement
                        with the Minister of Finance. This was known as the Principal Agreement. The
                        Principal Agreement sets out the obligations of the MIB to compensate
                        victims of road accidents under certain conditions. These were basically
                        where there was no effective insurance for the vehicle involved, where the
                        driver of the vehicle could not be traced or where the insurer had become
                        insolvent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, MIB entered into an agreement with all insurance companies and
                        Lloyds Underwriters which sold motor insurance policies in Singapore,
                        (“motor insurance business”). This was known as the Domestic
                        Agreement. The Domestic Agreement specifies the situations and conditions
                        under which an insurance company is liable to compensate victims of a road
                        accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     When any subsequent insurer applied for a
                    licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and part of its insurance
                    portfolio was motor insurance business, it was a condition of its licence that
                    it had to sign an agreement with the MIB and agree to the terms of the Domestic
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The underlying rationale of a scheme like the
                    Motor Insurers’ Bureau is to fulfil the social aim of providing
                    compensation for all road accident victims where for some reason there was no
                    effective insurance policy to cover the liability and it was also to help spread
                    the risk among all insurers issuing motor insurance policies within the
                    jurisdiction in cases of untraced drivers and insolvent insurers. Hence MIB had
                    the right to call for contributions from all insurers to meet its liabilities.
                    In addition, the concept of the “Insurer Concerned” was a
                    practical measure adopted to save administrative costs and relieve the MIB from
                    the need to have qualified staff to investigate, process and deal with or settle
                    claims of such victims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     When the MIBWM was set up in Malaysia in 1968,
                    the free flow of traffic between Singapore and Malaysia caused a problem.
                    Because Singapore vehicles could enter West Malaysia freely, MIBWM found it had
                    to compensate victims of road accidents on West Malaysian roads caused by
                    Singapore vehicles without a right to seek recovery because its equivalent of
                    the Domestic Agreement was only signed with insurers registered in Malaysia.
                    Malaysian insurers were thus left to shoulder the entire financial burden in
                    relation to Singapore vehicles travelling on Malaysian roads. Consequently,
                    pursuant to discussions between the regulators on both sides of the Causeway,
                    Singapore insurers signed special agreements to be bound as if they were bound
                    by MIBWM’s Memorandum and Articles of Association and their equivalents of
                    the Principal and Domestic Agreements. When Singapore set up the MIB seven years
                    later in 1975, there was therefore already a precedent to deal with the problem
                    of Malaysian vehicles on Singapore roads. Hence motor insurers transacting motor
                    insurance business on both sides of the Causeway had to enter into agreements
                    with the MIB or MIBWM respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Pacific Insurance and the MIB</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     P&amp;O Insurance carried on its insurance
                    business in Malaysia and was therefore not an original signatory to the Domestic
                    Agreement. However, on 15 September 1975, P&amp;O Insurance, like many other
                    Malaysian insurance companies then and subsequently, signed an agreement with
                    MIB, known as the Special Agreement (“Special Agreement”). The
                    Domestic Agreement was annexed to the Special Agreement and P&amp;O Insurance
                    agreed “...to be bound by the Articles of Association of the Bureau... in
                    every way as if the Company were a member of the Bureau”. The Special
                    Agreement therefore placed P&amp;O Insurance in the same contractual position as
                    any other member of MIB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At the time of the Special Agreement, the
                    motor vehicle insurance regimes in Singapore and Malaysia were largely the same,
                    if not <em>in </em><em>pari
                        </em><em>materia</em>. In particular, whilst it
                    was compulsory to have insurance cover for liability to third parties, it was
                    not mandatory for the owners and/or drivers of motor vehicles to carry obtain
                    insurance cover for injury to their passengers or pillion-riders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     This position changed in 1980, when Singapore
                    made passenger cover mandatory through an amendment to the MV(TP)A. This created
                    a divergence between the compulsory motor vehicle insurance requirements in
                    Malaysia and Singapore which persists to this day. The Malaysian Road Traffic
                    Ordinance 1958 (Ord 49 of 1958) did not require such coverage, and the position
                    remains the same in the current legislation governing motor insurance in
                    Malaysia, <em>viz</em>, the Road Transport Act 1987 (Act
                    333).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 24 September 1998, MIB entered into a
                    Supplemental Agreement with its members introducing some changes to the Domestic
                    Agreement. The key amendment was an update of references to the MV(TP)A so that
                    the scheme would operate against the backdrop of the current version of this
                    statute, Chapter 189, instead of Chapter 88.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     These differences have now given rise to the
                    dispute and the interpretation of the clauses within the various agreements
                    signed by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Dispute between the MIB and P&amp;O Insurance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the Special Agreement entered into between
                    P&amp;O Insurance and the MIB, recital 2 reads as follows:</p>

                            bound by the Articles of Association of the Bureau, the Agreement
                            between the Bureau and the Members and the Agreement between the Bureau

<p class="Judg-1">Insofar as this expresses the aim or intention of the parties, it

<p class="Judg-1">The Memorandum of Agreement referred to in clause 2 refers to the
                    Domestic Agreement between the MIB and its Members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Clause 3(1) of the Domestic Agreement provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a Judgment is obtained in Singapore against any person (hereinafter
                        referred to as the “Judgment Debtor”) in respect of liability
                        required to be insured by the Compulsory Insurance Legislation the Insurer
                        Concerned will satisfy the Original Judgment Creditor if and to the extent
                        that the Judgment has not been satisfied by the Judgment Debtor within
                        twenty-eight days from the date upon which the person in whose favour it was
                        given is entitled to enforce it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Clause 1 of the Domestic Agreement defines the terms “Insurer
                    Concerned” and “Compulsory Insurance Legislation” as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Insurer Concerned” means the Insurer who at the time of the
                        accident which gave rise to a liability required to be insured by the
                        Compulsory Insurance Legislation was providing an insurance against such
                        liability in respect of the vehicle arising out of the use of which the
                        liability of the Judgment Debtor was incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Compulsory Insurance Legislation” means the Motor Vehicles
                        (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Chapter 99) and any statutory
                        modifications thereto or any re-enactment thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     P&amp;O Insurance contends that it is not
                    bound to pay out to passengers or pillion riders for the following
                    interconnected reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     It is not an original signatory to
                        the Domestic Agreement of 22 February 1975 and it has no business presence
                        in Singapore. It is also a member of MIBWM and it had signed the Special
                        Agreement on 15 September 1975, subject always to terms and conditions of
                        its insurance policy;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     In September 1975, the legislation regulating compulsory insurance
                        cover was largely the same, if not <em>in pari
                            </em><em>materia</em>, in both Singapore and
                        Malaysia, so insurance cover for passenger liability was not compulsory and
                        the Special Agreement it had signed in September 1975 did not stipulate that
                        passenger liability was compulsory;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     It became compulsory to have insurance cover for
                        passenger liability in Singapore in 1980 but this was not compulsory in
                        Malaysia then or even today. P&amp;O Insurance being an insurance company
                        registered in Malaysia without any presence in Singapore, is regulated by
                        the then Malaysian Road Traffic Ordinance 1958 and the Road Transport Act
                        1987 now; it is not subject to s 4(1)(a) of the MV(TP)A;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     P&amp;O Insurance has warned their
                        policy holders in their motor insurance proposal forms that it is the
                        responsibility of the policy holder to extend their policy to obtain cover
                        legal liability to passengers if they enter Singapore, as it is an offence
                        to drive their vehicle without this cover there; P&amp;O Insurance does
                        offer this extended cover, for an additional premium;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     P&amp;O Insurance does not qualify as
                        an “Insurer Concerned” under clause 1 of the Domestic
                        Agreement unless the insured user of a Malaysian registered vehicle has
                        purchased additional cover for passengers or pillion riders. This is because
                        clause 1 states that the insurer must have been, at the time of the
                        accident, “<em>providing</em> an insurance
                        against <em>such</em> liability” (emphasis
                        added). P&amp;O Insurance’s motor insurance policy does not provide
                        cover for liability to passengers or pillion riders; but motor vehicle
                        owners and/or drivers can purchase a separate personal accident protection
                        plan which provides such extended cover from P&amp;O
                    Insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I cannot accept the argument that P&amp;O
                    Insurance signed the Special Agreement on 15 September 1975, subject always to
                    the terms and conditions of its insurance policy. That phrase and condition does
                    not appear anywhere in the Special Agreement. Neither can that term be implied
                    as it is not necessary for business efficacy nor does it pass the officious
                    bystander test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is clear and unarguable otherwise that by
                    clause 2 of the Special Agreement, P&amp;O Insurance covenanted with the MIB to
                    comply with every obligation imposed upon members of the MIB by the Domestic
                    Agreement as if P&amp;O Insurance was a party to thereto. A copy of the Domestic
                    Agreement was expressed to be annexed the Special Agreement. In fact, it will be
                    seen from recital 2, set out above at [23], that the Articles of Association of
                    the MIB, the Domestic Agreement and the Principal Agreement were all expressed
                    to be annexed to the Special Agreement. Additionally, P&amp;O Insurance
                    expressly agreed to be bound by the Articles of Association of the MIB. It is
                    not part of P&amp;O Insurance’s case that it did not possess or did not
                    know what was contained in those documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is stipulated in clear and unambiguous
                    language in clause 3(1) of the Domestic Agreement that if a judgment is obtained
                    in Singapore against any person in respect of liability which is required to be
                    insured by the Compulsory Insurance Legislation, the “Insurer
                    Concerned” must satisfy that judgment within a stipulated period. The
                    definitions of the terms “Insurer Concerned” and
                    “Compulsory Insurance Legislation” are found in clause 1 of the
                    Domestic Agreement as already set out above at [25].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     P&amp;O Insurance contends that it is not an
                    “Insurer Concerned” for the purposes of clause 3(1) of the
                    Domestic Agreement because according to the definition of this term in the
                    Domestic Agreement, it is clear that to be an “Insurer Concerned”
                    that insurer must have been <em>providing</em> an insurance
                    against “<em>such liability</em>”, <em>ie</em>, passenger or pillion-rider liability. Since P&amp;O
                    Insurance did not cover passenger or pillion rider liability, they are not an
                    “Insurer Concerned”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In my judgment, this is not the true and
                    proper construction of clause 3(1) of the Domestic Agreement and of the
                    definition of the term “Insurer Concerned”. The starting point
                    must be to consider the obligation undertaken by P&amp;O Insurance under clause
                    3(1) of the Domestic Agreement. The first requirement is that a judgment has
                    been obtained in Singapore against a person in respect of liability which has to
                    be insured under the Compulsory Insurance Legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Compulsory Insurance Legislation is defined as
                    the MV(TP)A <em>and</em> any statutory modifications
                    thereto or any re-enactments thereof. Accordingly P&amp;O Insurance has
                    expressly undertaken to accept modifications to the MV(TP)A or statutory
                    re-enactments thereof. It is not something static or frozen in time when P&amp;O
                    Insurance signed the Special Agreement in September 1975.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     If such a judgement is not satisfied within
                    the stipulated time or not in full, then the “Insurer Concerned”
                    has to satisfy that judgment or the shortfall. In that context, the phrase
                    “such insurance” clearly refers to “such” policy
                    that was issued by the Insurer as was required by the compulsory insurance
                    regime in law, <em>ie</em>, the MV(TP)A, as it stood at
                    that point in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It cannot matter that that Insurer and its
                    policy did not cover passenger or pillion rider liability because that was the
                    whole purpose and rationale for such a scheme, <em>ie</em>,
                    where there was no <em>effective</em> insurance cover, the
                    victim was assured of compensation and that was dealt with by the Insurer who
                    issued the motor policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The definition of “Insurer
                    Concerned” also makes clear by elaboration, that the insurance company
                    which issued the policy to the judgment debtor remains an “Insurer
                    Concerned”. This was notwithstanding that, for example, the insurance was
                    obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, non-disclosure of material facts, mistake,
                    or that there was some term, description, limitation, exception or condition of
                    the insurance policy or of the proposal form on which it was based expressly or
                    by implication excludes the insurer’s liability whether generally or in
                    the particular circumstances in which the judgment debtor liability was
                    incurred, or even in the situation where the judgment debtor was in unauthorised
                    possession of the vehicle by which liability incurred on the part of the
                    judgment debtor arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Furthermore, it should be noticed that within
                    the definition of “Insurer Concerned” there is a reference to
                    “the liability of the Judgment Debtor”, which suggests that clause
                    1 of the Domestic Agreement draws internal distinctions between the <em>specific</em> liability incurred by the judgment debtor and
                    the <em>general</em> class of liability covered by
                    Compulsory Insurance Legislation. If not for such a distinction, the specific
                    reference to “the liability of the Judgment Debtor” would
                    constitute otiose verbiage in an otherwise tightly worded document. On the
                    plaintiff’s interpretation, “the liability of the Judgment
                    Debtor” can be substituted with the single pronoun “it” and
                    the meaning of clause 1 would be unchanged. I therefore attribute significance
                    to the specific words used in the drafting of the provision, and as such would
                    reject the plaintiff’s interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In my judgment, clause 3(1) of the Domestic
                    Agreement and the definition of “Insurer Concerned” in clause 1 of
                    the Domestic Agreement refers to an insurer which covers any form of liability
                    which is also the subject of the MV(TP)A. It follows from this that clause 3(1)
                    operates to place an obligation on such insurers to satisfy judgment debts
                    arising from <em>other</em> forms of liability covered by
                    the MV(TP)A but not expressly included in the insurance policy, such as
                    passenger liability in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I am fortified by what is stated in Poh Chu
                    Chai, <em>Law of Life, Motor and Workmen’s Compensation
                        Insurance</em> (Lexis Nexis, 2006, 6<sup>th</sup> ed)
                    at 652, <em>viz</em>, that the MIB was incorporated
                    primarily as “...an attempt by motor insurers to bridge the apparent gaps
                    that have arisen in the scheme of compulsory motor insurance provided under the
                    Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This is also referred to in the pre-amble to
                    the Principal Agreement entered into between MIBS and the Minister of Finance on
                    the same day as the Domestic Agreement, a copy of which was also annexed
                    thereto, which states that the <em>raison-d’etre</em>
                    of the scheme was “to secure compensation to third party victims of road
                    accidents in cases where, notwithstanding the provisions of the Motor Vehicles
                    (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Chapter 88) relating to compulsory
                    insurance, the victim is deprived of compensation by the absence of insurance,
                    or of effective insurance.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The practical effect
                    of the scheme is fully fleshed out in clause 3 of the Principal
                    Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If judgment in respect of any liability which is required to be covered by
                        a policy of insurance under the Act is obtained against any person or
                        persons in any Court in Singapore and either at the time of the accident
                        giving rise to such liability there is not in force a policy of insurance as
                        required by the Act or such policy is ineffective for any reason (including
                        the inability of the insurer to make payment) and any such judgment is not

                        favour such judgement was given...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As counsel for MIB, Mr Andre Yeap SC, submits,
                    clause 3 of the Domestic Agreement simply represents a transmission of
                    MIB’s mirror obligation under the Principal Agreement to its members via
                    the “Insurer Concerned” mechanism. This is confirmed by clause 4
                    of the Domestic Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All payments made by an Insurer under Clause 3(1) hereof shall be deemed
                        to be made in discharge of the liability of the Bureau under the Annexed
                        Agreement to make the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The whole scheme of a motor insurance bureau
                    rests on providing a social safety net for accident victims which fall through
                    gaps in the compulsory insurance cover. The concept of the “Insurer
                    Concerned” is to cut down administrative costs of a bureau, which would
                    have to be borne at the end of the day by all general insurers issuing motor
                    policies. I accept the evidence set out in Mr Chew Loy Kiat’s affidavit,
                    which explains the “Insurer Concerned” concept as having been
                    “designed as a practical measure to achieve administrative convenience
                    and save costs, by relieving [MIB] from investigating, handling and settling
                    claims from victims of road accidents in cases where there is an Insurer
                    Concerned.” Further, “[t]he concept works by the ‘swings and
                    roundabouts’ principle, as all compensation payments by the [MIB] under
                    the Principal Agreement are indirectly financed by all its
                        members”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Moreover, the whole idea of getting Singapore
                    registered insurers who issue motor policies to sign up with the MIBWM and
                    Malaysian registered insurers who issue motor policies to sign up with MIB is
                    for the convenience of the motoring public in both countries <em>and</em> importantly for the protection of potential victims from the
                    use of motor vehicles. Motorists and motorcyclists can seamlessly travel into
                    Singapore or Malaysia and third parties in the other country will always be
                    protected against the possibility of being left without compensation for death
                    or personal injury caused by a Singapore or Malaysian vehicle. This regime was
                    agreed to by all motor insurers who had signed up with the MIB and MIBWM.
                    P&amp;O Insurance’s current position detracts from both the motor
                    insurance bureau scheme and the reciprocal registration arrangement between MIB
                    and MIBWM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     My attention was also drawn to an apparently
                    similar case of <em>Kurnia Insurance (Malaysia) Berhad v Koo Siew
                        Tai</em> (Originating Summons No 383 of 2010) (“<em>Kurnia</em>”), which concerned issues broadly similar
                    to the matter before me. The plaintiff in that case was also a Malaysian
                    insurance company and it sought a declaration that it was not liable to satisfy
                    any judgment for damages against the second defendant, as well as an injunction
                    restraining both defendants from making any claim against the MIB for the same
                    sum. The second defendant was the policy-holder and owner of the vehicle
                    involved in an accident, and the first Defendant was his pillion. I draw comfort
                    from the fact that Prakash J dismissed both of the plaintiff’s
                    applications. Unfortunately though, there was no occasion for the learned judge
                    to provide written grounds of her decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     My attention was also drawn to <em>Cosmic Insurance Corp Ltd v Ong Kah Hoe (trading as Ong Industrial
                        Supplies) and another</em> [1996] SGHC 42 (“<em>Cosmic Insurance (No 1)</em>”). Kan J, in allowing the
                    Defendants’ application to set aside default judgment obtained in favour
                    of the Plaintiff, appeared to be of the view that the insurer would not be
                    liable to make payment if the insured had acted outside of the terms of the
                    policy:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    The second defendant may have driven the lorry with
                            the authority of the first defendant, but he was driving when his
                            licence was suspended. Since he was driving when he was not licensed to
                            drive, he was not an authorised driver for the purposes of the policy,
                            and he was not a person insured by the policy. Proceeding from that, the
                            plaintiffs were not required by s 9(1) to satisfy the judgment against
                            him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Unfortunately, this issue was not explored
                    further at trial before Rubin J in <em>Cosmic Insurance Corp Ltd
                        v Ong Kah Hoe (trading as Ong Industrial Supplies) and another</em>
                    [1997] SGHC 237 (“<em>Cosmic Insurance (No
                    2)</em>”), which was decided on grounds that are not relevant to
                    the issues in these proceedings. With respect, excessive weight should not be
                    placed on <em>Cosmic Insurance (No 1)</em>, as it arose on
                    an interlocutory appeal in which it was sufficient for the defendant to show
                    that he had merits to which the court should pay heed, and consequently allow
                    him to proceed to trial by setting aside the default judgment. There was no
                    determination at that stage but the matter was left to the trial judge to make a
                    determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The reasons set out above are sufficient to
                    dispose of the issues raised in these proceedings where I have held in favour of
                    MIB. However I will now deal with two, in my view, subsidiary points raised by
                    the parties, neither of which is determinative of the issues set out in the
                    respective Originating Summonses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">P&amp;O Insurance did not sign the Supplemental Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Counsel for P&amp;O Insurance, Mr Harry Elias
                    SC, submitted that it was significant that other insurers signed a Supplemental
                    Agreement on 24 September 1998 but P&amp;O Insurance did not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is important to note that this is a
                    buttressing argument because P&amp;O Insurance’s refusal to sign the
                    Supplemental Agreement will only advance its case if such a refusal constitutes
                    unilateral withdrawal from the Special Agreement, or if the Supplemental
                    Agreement was a novation of the Domestic Agreement. There are clear factors
                    which obstruct the plaintiff’s progress along both routes. The plaintiff
                    remains a member of MIB, and indeed has made payment to passengers pursuant to
                    its obligations under the Special Agreement in a previous case albeit under
                    protest. There is also no suggestion that the Supplemental Agreement was a
                    novation, particularly because the pre-amble states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The parties hereto are desirous of implementing certain amendments and/or
                        changes and/or modifications to the 1975 Members’ Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Furthermore, it is plainly evident, on the face of the Supplemental
                    Agreement, that there is no novation of the Domestic Agreement. P&amp;O
                    Insurance remains bound by the Special Agreement which it signed in September
                    1975 with the MIB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I agree with Mr Andre Yeap SC, that the terms
                    of the Supplemental Agreement do not affect any obligations undertaken by
                    P&amp;O Insurance under the Special Agreement. The Supplemental Agreement dealt
                    with two main areas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The first is that it updated references to the
                    “Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 88, 1970
                    Rev Ed)” to the “Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and
                    Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed)” (“MV(TPR)A”). I
                    have already referred to the definition of “Compulsory Insurance
                    Legislation” in clause 1 of the Domestic Agreement which catered for
                    modifications or re-enactments of the MV(TPR)A with the words: “and any
                    statutory modifications thereto or re-enactments thereof.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The second aspect was an amendment to the
                    definition of “Insurer Concerned”. The first and relevant portion
                    of the original definition, set out in [25] above was retained, word for word.
                    The clarification as to when an insurer still remained an “Insurer
                    Concerned” was also retained word for word. The amendments made to the
                    latter part of the definition as to when an insurer ceases to be an insurer
                    concerned and motor trade policies are irrelevant to this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Supplemental Agreement expressly provided
                    that, save for the amendments contained in the Supplemental Agreement, none of
                    which are relevant to this case, the 1975 Domestic Agreement “...shall
                    remain in full force and effect.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     None of these amendments affect the present
                    case. Consequently, the fact that P&amp;O Insurance did not sign the
                    Supplemental Agreement does not buttress its case that its obligations are
                    somehow confined to the MV(TP)A as it stood in September 1975. In entering and
                    remaining party to the Special Agreement the plaintiff has bound itself to
                    compensate third-parties for liabilities in accordance with its
                terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The P&amp;O Insurance Certificate of Insurance that was
                Issued</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Harry Elias SC also stressed the fact that
                    his client does cover pillion-rider liability but at an additional premium. He
                    added that his client also did warn their insureds, when they filled in the
                    proposal form, that it is an offence under Singapore law to enter Singapore
                    without extending their motor insurance to cover legal liability to
                    passengers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Certificate of Insurance issued to Ravi
                    comprised 3 pages. P&amp;O Insurance points to the bottom of the first page
                    where there is a reference in small print to the policy to which the Certificate
                    related was issued in accordance with various statutes (including the
                    “Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Ordinance 1960
                    (Republic of Singapore)”) to bolster its case that their policy did not
                    cover passenger or pillion rider cover required under the MV(TP)A, while MIB
                    points to the third page where under the heading “Legislation”,
                    there is a reference to the “Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and
                    Compensation) Act (Cap 189)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This does not assist either party. The rights
                    and obligations of MIB and P&amp;O Insurance are governed by the written
                    agreement they entered into and not any particular insurance certificate issued
                    by P&amp;O Insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Context and Social Legislation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I have already referred to the nature of
                    social legislation covering the use of motor vehicles and the unfortunate
                    consequences for victims where the owner or driver cannot satisfy the judgment
                    obtained by the victim and where there is no effective insurance cover. I do not
                    think there is any right-thinking member of or entity in our society, be it an
                    insurer, a businessman, a vehicle owner, a legislator, or even the man on the
                    street, who will disagree that such a state of affairs is
                undesirable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Schemes like that of a motor insurance bureau
                    perform a crucial function. Its laudable objectives cannot be denied. This is
                    supported by motor insurers, both financially and morally, as responsible
                    corporate citizens. The exchange of correspondence in the past, between the MIB,
                    MIBWM, the Insurance Commissioner (as he was then called), Persatuan Insuran Am
                    Malaysia (PIAM or the insurance association of Malaysia) and Bank Negara all
                    show or at least point to their support of the schemes in place in Malaysia and
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is thus unfortunate that cases like this
                    occur. Perhaps it may have been due to financial considerations or pressure.
                    When the Special Agreement was signed in September 1975, the rate of exchange
                    was around MYR1.00 to S$0.9348<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> or S$1.00 was
                    equivalent to MYR1.0697. When Ganesan obtained his judgment on 27 July 2010, the
                    exchange rate was around S$1.00 to MYR2.3408 and on 27 September 2012 it was
                    around S$1.00 to MYR$2.500. However it will be a misfortune for society on both
                    sides of the Causeway if this laudable scheme unravels due to such financial
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Decision and Declaration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     For the reasons set out above, I grant the
                    declaration sought by MIB in OS 580. I declare that on a true and proper
                    construction of the Agreement dated 22 February 1975 between the Honourable
                    Minister of Finance and MIB (referred to herein as the Principal Agreement), the
                    MOA dated 22 February 1975 between MIB and its members (referred to herein as
                    the Domestic Agreement), the Agreement dated 15 September 1975 between MIB and
                    P&amp;O Insurance (referred to herein as the Special Agreement), and the terms
                    of P&amp;O Insurance’s policy of motor insurance:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_i"></a>(i)     if a driver of a Malaysian
                        registered motor vehicle insured by P&amp;O Insurance is involved in an
                        accident in Singapore, personal injury is caused to a passenger of the said
                        vehicle, liability for such personal injury being excluded or not covered by
                        the terms of P&amp;O Insurance’s policy of motor insurance, and
                        judgment is obtained in Singapore by the said passenger against the said
                        driver but such judgment is not satisfied in full within 28 days, and all
                        other pre-conditions to liability under clause 3 of the Principal Agreement
                        being either satisfied or inapplicable as the case may be, then P&amp;O
                        Insurance is obliged to satisfy the said judgment obtained by the said
                        passenger to the extent that it remains unsatisfied; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     if MIB is to satisfy the said
                        judgment obtained by that passenger, to the extent that it remains
                        unsatisfied in the situation referred to above, MIB is entitled to recover
                        this amount from P&amp;O Insurance which shall indemnify MIB for all
                        amounts, costs and/or interest paid by MIB in connection with the
                        judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The application by P&amp;O Insurance in OS 808
                    is therefore dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Costs will follow the event. MIB is entitled
                    to its costs in OS 580 and OS 808 with due regard for the overlap.</p>
