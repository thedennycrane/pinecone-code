<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s affidavit in support of this
                application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       One of the plaintiff’s directors and
                    shareholders, Lawrence Leow Chin Hin, filed an affidavit in support of this
                    application. The following background facts and assertions are taken from this
                    affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On or about the end of 2001, one Loh Lin Kett
                    (“Loh”), trading as L K Loh Construction Company, applied to wind
                    up the Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The application was heard
                    and granted by Woo Bih Li JC on 11 January 2002.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The defendant was appointed as the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       According to the plaintiff, on or about
                    8 November 2002, the defendant, in his capacity as the liquidator of the
                    Company, invited parties to tender for the purchase of the whole of Lot 5643M
                    together with the uncompleted building erected on 10 Kaki Bukit Industrial
                    Terrace Singapore 471819 (“the Property”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> On 7 January 2003, the
                    plaintiff submitted two tenders, one in its name and the other in the name of an
                    associated company, M/s Fiordland Pte Ltd
                        (“Fiordland”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The
                    plaintiff submitted a tender in the sum of $5,318,000 and paid the sum of
                    $800,000 as a tender fee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Fiordland submitted a
                    tender in the sum of $7,238,000 and also paid a tender fee of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff was later informed on
                    8 January 2003 that the two tenders were rejected.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> It claims to have subsequently
                    found out that the tender was awarded to M/s Wellsprings Properties Pte Ltd
                        (“Wellsprings”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Wellsprings
                    had submitted a tender in the sum of $8,200,818.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff claims that on or about October
                    2009, it came to Loh’s knowledge that Wellsprings had paid secret
                    commissions in the amount of $270,000 to the defendant in 2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff found out about
                    this through Loh who was, at the material time, engaged as the defendant’s
                    personal assistant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff claims that
                    Loh discovered the following invoices at the defendant’s offices while
                    assisting the defendant:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     An invoice dated 16 November 2003
                        from M/s K S Resource &amp; Management Services (“K S
                        Resource”) to Wellsprings for the total sum of $75,000. According to
                        the plaintiff, this was purportedly a “finder’s fee” for
                        identifying and securing the Property for Wellsprings. A completion account
                        and mode of disbursement for the sale of the Property was attached to the
                        invoice. The plaintiff alleges that it was apparent from the
                        defendant’s handwritten notes on the invoice that he had acknowledged
                        receipt of $30,000 on 10 March 2004 and $120,000 on 28 September
                        2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     An invoice
                        dated 31 December 2004 from K S Resource to Peh Lee Construction Pte Ltd for
                        the total sum of $44,000. According to the plaintiff, this was purportedly a
                        consultancy fee for wall cladding and the provision of quality control
                        services.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     An
                        invoice dated 3 January 2005 from K S Resource to Wellsprings for the
                        total sum of $76,000. According to the plaintiff, this was purportedly a
                        consultancy fee for an investment at Xiamen, China.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     A handwritten note in relation to the
                        contents of the 31 December 2004 invoice and the 3 January 2005
                        invoice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff’s representative deposed
                    that K S Resource is a sole proprietorship owned by one Mdm Goh Yang
                    Soo, who the plaintiff understands to be the defendant’s “common
                    law wife”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Consequently, the
                    plaintiff believes that the defendant and/or his proxies had been paid secret
                    commissions in the sum of $270,000 to award the tender to
                        Wellsprings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As a result of the foregoing, the plaintiff
                    commenced an action against the defendant in S162/2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In this action, the plaintiff has
                    alleged that the defendant was, at the material time, the controlling mind,
                    will, alter ego and/or the agent of the Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> It has also
                    alleged that the defendant breached the contract between the plaintiff and the
                    company, induced the breach of this contract, breached the plaintiff’s
                    legitimate expectation that the tender process for the sale of the property
                    would be conducted in good faith, committed fraud by receiving secret
                    commissions from Wellsprings to award a tender to it, and/or breached his common
                    law duty of care, which he owed to all the bidders of the Property, to treat all
                    bidders fairly and equally.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 25 April 2011, the defendant filed an
                    application to strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim in
                        S162/2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In support of this
                    application, the defendant had deposed that the plaintiffs’ causes of
                    action in tort and contract were time barred.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> It was also
                    alleged that the court’s leave should have been obtained before commencing
                        S162/2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff’s representative has
                    deposed that he believes and has been advised that there was no need to seek the
                    court’s leave before commencing S162/2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>
                    However, if leave was required, he asserted that leave should be granted because
                    there is a <em>prima facie</em> case against the
                        defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s reply affidavit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The defendant pointed out that the plaintiff
                    took out a similar application in Summons No 600093 of 2011
                    (“SUM600093/2011”) for leave of court on 30 May
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> I heard that application. I voiced
                    my view that there were procedural irregularities in that application. On
                    26 July 2011, the plaintiff sought and obtained leave from me to withdraw
                    that application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendant referred to and incorporated his
                    reply affidavit for SUM600093/2011 in his reply affidavit for the present
                        application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> In his reply affidavit for
                    SUM600093/2011, the defendant deposed that the tender was awarded to Wellsprings
                    which had submitted the highest bid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendant referred to the affidavit that he had filed in support of his
                    application to strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim in S162/2011.
                    The plaintiff had deposed that, as a court-appointed liquidator, he was an
                    officer of the court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Hence, leave of the

                    The defendant also asserted that the plaintiff has not managed to establish a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case against him that would
                    warrant the grant of the court’s leave.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The following issues arise for my
                    consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Does the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                        2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”) and Companies (Winding Up) Rules
                        (Cap 50, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“C(WU)R”) require a
                        plaintiff to obtain the court’s leave before commencing an action
                        against a liquidator of a company
                    (“Issue 1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     If not, is there a common law rule to that effect
                        (“Issue 2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     If there is such a common law rule, can leave be granted
                        retrospectively (“Issue 3”)? The relevance of this issue
                        is that the plaintiff has <em>already</em> commenced
                        action against the defendant (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     If so, should leave be granted
                        (“Issue 4”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Does the CA and the C(WU)R require a plaintiff to obtain the
                court’s leave before commencing an action against a liquidator of a
                company?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Neither the CA nor the C(WU)R requires a
                    plaintiff to seek the court’s leave before suing a liquidator. In passing,
                    however, I should highlight three provisions in the CA concerning the legal
                    liabilities of liquidators. The first is s 265 of the CA which provides for
                    the Official Receiver to have oversight over private liquidators (see s 265
                    of the CA):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">265.—(1)  Where in the winding up of a company by the
                        Court, a person, other than the Official Receiver, is the liquidator the

                        does not faithfully perform his duties and duly observe all the requirements
                        imposed on him by any written law or otherwise with respect to the
                        performance of his duties, or if any complaint is made to the Official
                        Receiver by any creditor or contributory in regard thereto, the Official
                        Receiver shall inquire into the matter, and take such action thereon as he
                        may think expedient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The Official Receiver may at any time require any

                            and may, if the Official Receiver thinks fit, apply to the Court to
                            examine him or any other person on oath concerning the winding

                            liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second provision is s 313(2) of the CA which provides
                    that the court is to take cognizance of the conduct of liquidators:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

                            or if any complaint is made to the Court by any creditor or contributory
                            or by the Official Receiver in regard thereto, the Court shall inquire
                            into the matter and take such action as it thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The third provision is s 341 of the CA which confers the
                    court with the power to assess damages against, <em>inter

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Is there a common law rule to that effect?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I first examine the position in Singapore
                    before considering the approach taken in other jurisdictions and I will conclude
                    by providing my view.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The position in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     There is no case law in Singapore directly on
                    point. The leading treatise on Singapore company law, <em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em> (Tan Cheng
                    Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Rev 3rd Ed, 2009), does not suggest that there
                    is a requirement for leave of court before a party can commence an action
                    against the liquidator of a company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I note, however, that there is at least one
                    case in Singapore of an action against a private liquidator (see <em>Trustee of Estate of Ong Thiam Huat v Chan Hock Seng</em>
                    [2004] SGHC 232, which was a claim against liquidator for negligence
                    in failing to recover a debt before it became time-barred). Unfortunately, the
                    narrative of the background in the judgment does not explain whether the
                    plaintiff in that case had applied for leave before commencing his
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Australia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Australian position is well settled. There
                    is ample case law holding that leave of court is required in order to commence
                    proceedings against a liquidator (<em>Armitage v Gainsborough
                        Properties Pty Ltd and another</em> [2011] VSC 419
                        (“<em>Armitage</em>”) at [34]–[42], <em>Baxter v
                        Hamilton</em> [2005] TASC 64 (“<em>Baxter</em>”) at [32], <em>Mamone </em><em>and another v Pantzer</em> [2001] NSWSC 26
                        (“<em>Mamone</em>”), <em>Sydlow Pty Ltd (in liq) v TG Kotselas Pty Ltd</em>
                        [1996] 144 ALR 159<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> at 165 (“<em>Sydlow</em>”) and <em>Re Siromath Pty Ltd
                        (No 3)</em> [1991] 25 NSWLR 25 (“<em>Siromath</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The rationale for requiring leave is two-fold
                    (see <em>Mamone</em> at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the courts have an interest
                        in protecting their own officers from facing “spurious or vexatious
                        litigation” (see <em>Siromath</em> at 29
                        and <em>Armitage at </em>[35]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the courts have an interest in
                        protecting the integrity of the winding-up process so that the process is
                        conducted quickly and efficiently for the benefit of all interested persons
                        (see <em>Sydlow</em> at [29]). Requiring the court’s leave
                        in order to commence proceedings against a liquidator is one of the measures
                        that the court can adopt to achieve this objective (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Australian position does not appear to be
                    based on any provision in the relevant Australian legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">England</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     To my knowledge, there is no English case law
                    on whether leave of court is required to commence an action against a
                    liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There is, however, a requirement for leave in
                    order to sue a receiver (see <em>Re Maidstone Palace of
                        Varieties</em> [1909] 2 Ch 283 at 286
                        (“<em>Re Maidstone Palace of
                    Varieties</em>”), <em>McGowan v Chadwick and
                        another</em> [2002] EWCA Civ 1785 at [32] and <em>Weston v
                        Dayman</em> [2006] EWCA Civ 1165 at [16]). The rationale for the requirement for
                    leave appears to be similar to the first rationale in the Australian cases (see
                    above at [19(a)]), <em>viz</em>, the desire to protect
                    an officer of the court (see <em>Re Maidstone Palace of Varieties
                        at</em> 286):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case the applicant is a receiver appointed by this Court in a
                        debenture-holders' action, and by virtue of that appointment he has had the
                        management of the theatre known as the Maidstone Palace of Varieties. In the
                        course of that management he made use of certain plant which is claimed by
                        the respondent company as their property. They say that he had no right to
                        use it except on the terms of paying them a rent, and they claim a
                        considerable sum. It appears to me that a dispute of that kind is one which,
                        as is shewn by Aston v. Heron, the Court will deal with itself, and that
                            <b><em>it will not allow its officer to be subject to an
                            action in another Court with reference to his conduct in the discharge
                            of the duties of his office, whether right or wrong</em></b>. The
                        proper remedy for any one aggrieved by his conduct is to apply to this Court
                        in the action in which he was appointed. If any wrong has been done by the
                        officer, the Court will no doubt see that justice is done, but no one has a
                        right to sue such an officer in another Court without the sanction of this
                        Court. The present application is accordingly right in form. The respondents
                        must therefore bring in their claim in the debenture-holders' action within
                        fourteen days, and must be restrained from commencing any other proceedings
                        against the receiver.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Malaysian courts, like their Australian

                    a liquidator (see, for example, <em>See Teow Guan &amp; Ors v
                        Kian </em><em>Joo Holdings Sdn </em><em>Bhd &amp; Ors</em> [2010] 1 MLJ 547

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The rationale underlying the Malaysian
                    position is similar to the first rationale in the Australian cases (see above
                    at [19(a)]). Leave is required because a court-appointed liquidator is an
                    officer of the court (see, for example, <em>Chi Liung
                        Holdings</em> and <em>Abric
                        at</em> [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Malaysian position is not based on any
                    express provision in the relevant legislation in Malaysia. It should be noted,
                    however, that the Malaysian Court of Appeal in <em>Chi Liung
                        Holdings</em> referred to a provision in the Malaysian legislation
                    (s 236(3) of the Companies Act 1965 (Act 125 of 1965) (Mal)) in
                    support of its reasoning that the liquidator is an officer of the court. The
                    relevant provision reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The exercise by the liquidator of the powers
                            conferred by this section shall be subject to the control of the Court,
                            and any creditor or contributory may apply to the Court with respect to
                            any exercise or proposed exercise of any of those powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Singapore CA has an <em>identical</em>
                    provision (see s 272(3) of the CA):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The exercise by the liquidator of the powers
                            conferred by this section shall be subject to the control of the Court,

                            any exercise or proposed exercise of any of those powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In my view, the Australian and Malaysian
                    positions should be followed in Singapore. A common law requirement for leave
                    will promote the desirable objective of ensuring that the winding-up process is
                    conducted efficiently and expeditiously in the interest of all stakeholders. The
                    observations of V K Rajah JC, (as he then was), in <em>Korea Asset Management Corp v Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd (in

                    against a company once winding-up proceedings have been instituted are useful in
                    this regard:</p>

                            ss 262(3), 299(2) and 227C(c) of the CA] is axiomatic: it is to
                            prevent the company from being further burdened by expenses incurred in

                                a company and its liquidators once winding up has commenced should
                                be to prevent the fragmentation of its assets and to ensure that the
                                interests of its creditors are protected to the fullest extent.
                                </em></b><b><em>In other words, returns to legitimate
                                creditors should be maximised; the process of collecting assets and
                                returning them to legitimate creditors should be attended to with
                                all practicable speed.</em></b> Unnecessary costs should not be
                            incurred; liquidators should act in the collective interests of all
                            legitimate stakeholders and not with a view to enhancing their own
                            self-interests or fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This rationale applies equally to claims against a liquidator. A
                    requirement for leave would ensure that frivolous claims are weeded out at the
                    outset. This would avoid unnecessary and expensive legal
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The other reasoning adopted by the Australian
                    and Malaysian courts, <em>viz</em>, that the liquidator is
                    an officer of the court is, in my opinion, less persuasive. Advocates and
                    solicitors are also “officers of the court” (see s 82(1) of
                    the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, Rev Ed 2009)). It is trite that
                    there is no requirement for leave in order to sue a lawyer. In my view, the
                    underlying reason for why liquidators are viewed as requiring the court’s
                    protection is that they play a central role in administering the winding-up
                    process. They should be protected against unmeritorious, frivolous or vexatious
                    legal proceedings which will cause delays and incur additional expense to the
                    general body of creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Can leave be obtained retrospectively?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There is a suggestion in an Australian
                    decision that leave can be sought retrospectively or <em>nunc pro
                        tunc</em> (see <em>McDonald v Dare</em>
                    [2001] QSC 405 (“<em>McDonald</em>”) at [25]). <em>McDonald</em> concerned an
                    application for the removal of liquidators of a company (“the parent
                    company”) on the ground of a “prospect, existence or appearance of
                    bias or of a conflict of interest” in the light of the liquidators’
                    involvement as co-defendants in legal proceedings arising from the sale of a
                    property owned by a company (“the subsidiary”). The parent company
                    owned 50% of the shares in the subsidiary. In dismissing the application, the
                    court observed that the other legal proceedings involved allegations that the
                    liquidators had breached their duties (<em>McDonald</em>
                        at [25]). Accordingly, leave of
                    court was required. Significantly, the court suggested that leave should be
                    sought <em>nunc pro tunc</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[25]  Another problem with the Supreme Court proceeding
                            is that as it seeks relief against the respondents for alleged breaches
                            of duty arising in the course of performing their duties as liquidators,
                            the leave of the court is required before such a proceeding is
                            commenced: <em>Sydlow Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v TG
                                Kotselas Pty Ltd</em> (1996) 65 FCR 234, 241 and
                                <em>Mamone v Pantzer</em>
                            [2001] NSWSC 26; (2001) 36 ACSR 743, 746. <b><em>Before the plaintiffs seek to serve the claim and
                                statement of claim in the Supreme Court proceeding, leave should be
                                sought nunc pro tunc in respect of commencing the Supreme Court
                                proceeding.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     There is a division in the Canadian
                    authorities as to whether leave may be granted retrospectively (see the cases
                    listed in <em>Houlden</em> at para K§7). One line of
                    cases reasons that the failure to obtain leave before commencing action will
                    cause the action to be a nullity (<em>ibid</em>). The other
                    line of cases states that leave may be obtained retrospectively as long as there
                    is no prejudice (in the sense that the trustee was not taken by surprise), the
                    action was brought in good faith and is not frivolous or vexatious and leave
                    would have been granted if it had been sought at the outset (<em>ibid</em>). The authors of <em>Houlden</em> take
                    the view that the second line of cases is the preferred interpretation of
                    s 215 of the BIA (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above)
                    because “it avoids a technical interpretation of the [BIA] and achieves a
                    fair and just result” (<em>Houlden</em> at
                    para K§7). I tend to agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As the plaintiff has submitted<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>, the Singapore High
                    Court has granted leave <em>nunc pro tunc</em> in the
                    context of a claim against a <em>company</em> in
                    liquidation (see <em>Jumabhoy Rafiq v Scotts Investment
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation)</em>
                    [2003] 2 SLR(R) 422 (“<em>Jumabhoy</em>”)). Leave is expressly required by the CA in
                    order to commence such a claim (see s 262(3) of the CA). Woo Bih Li J
                    took the view that the purpose underlying the requirement for leave under
                    s 262(3) of the CA is to ensure that the liquidators do not get distracted
                    and expend the company’s assets to defend unnecessary actions (<em>Jumabhoy at</em> [48]). The purpose was not to allow the
                    liquidators (and hence the other creditors) to enjoy an “unexpected
                    windfall” which would have been the effect if Woo J took the view
                    that leave could not have been granted retrospectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In my view, the reasoning in <em>Jumabhoy</em> applies equally here. As I have stated above,
                    the purpose of the requirement for leave is to ensure that the winding-up
                    process is carried out expeditiously and efficiently and to sieve out claims
                    that are without merit or aimed at delaying the liquidation process
                        (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above). That purpose
                    would not be served by holding that leave can only be granted if it is applied
                    for prospectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 4: Should leave be granted?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There is no clear test for the grant of leave
                    in the Australian authorities. Some of the cases take the view that there is no
                    specific threshold for the grant of leave to sue a liquidator (see <em>Sydlow</em> at 166; followed in <em>Mamone at</em> [5]).
                    According to these authorities, a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    need not necessarily be shown. All the circumstances have to be taken into
                    account in determining whether leave should be granted (see <em>Sydlow</em> at 166). An example of a factor that would influence
                    the grant of leave is whether there was an unjustifiable delay in commencing
                    proceedings against the liquidator (see <em>Mamone
                        at</em> [6]). Another case
                    held that the standard was simply one of whether there is a <em>prima facie</em> case (see <em>Re Biposo Pty Ltd;
                        Condon v Rodgers</em> (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales,
                    Young J, 2 August 1995) cited in <em>Armitage</em>
                        at [37]). Yet another case
                    appeared to apply a combined test of whether there was a <em>prima facie</em> case and whether there was sufficient evidence to
                    show that the proposed claims had a prospect of success (see <em>Armitage</em> at [65]). The Malaysian authorities do not also
                    speak with one voice on the threshold for leave. One case applied a test of
                    whether there was “sufficient <em>prima facie</em>
                    evidence” to support the allegations against the liquidator (see
                        <em>Abric</em> at [30]). Another case took the view, similar to some of the
                    Australian authorities, that the threshold for leave would depend on the
                    circumstances and that a variety of factors such as the “sufficiency of
                    the evidence adduced” and the “likelihood of success” of
                    the proposed action should be considered (see <em>See Teow
                        Guan</em> at [7]). Another
                    authority considered that the court hearing the application for leave will
                    “act liberally” (<em>Chi Liung Holdings
                        at</em> 210G–H). However, the applicant is required to
                    satisfy the court of the “probable success” of the action and that
                    the action is “not vexatious or merely oppressive” (<em>ibid</em>). The Canadian approach seems to set the threshold
                    at a lower level. Leave will not be denied “unless there is no foundation
                    for the claim or the claim is frivolous or vexatious” (see <em>Houlden</em> at para K§8).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The foregoing cases show a considerable range
                    in the different standards of proof to be met before leave is granted. In my
                    view, all the facts and circumstances of the case have to be taken into
                    consideration when deciding whether to grant leave. Hard and fast rules should
                    not be laid down. To my mind, the applicant must at least be able to show a
                        <em>prima facie</em> arguable case. An applicant need
                    not go so far as to show he will or is likely to succeed. Applications without
                    any foundation or that are frivolous or vexatious or calculated to delay
                    proceedings or with an ulterior motive will not be allowed. The stage at which
                    the proceedings are when such applications are made will also be a very relevant
                    consideration. Delays in taking out such applications, unless there are good
                    reasons, will also weigh against an applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the context of the present application, the
                    Company has already been wound-up.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> There is, accordingly, no purpose to be
                    served by withholding leave to commence any action against the defendant. As I
                    have held above, the rationale for the requirement of leave is to ensure that
                    the winding-up process is conducted expeditiously and efficiently for the
                    benefit of all the stakeholders in the company (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above). In these circumstances, I do not
                    consider that it is necessary to set the threshold for leave at a high level.
                    Proceeding only on the basis of the evidence set out before me, I find that the
                    plaintiff has a <em>prima facie</em> arguable case against
                    the Liquidator. Hence, I grant the plaintiff retrospective leave to commence
                    S162/2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In relation to the merits of the claims
                    against the defendant in S162/2011, I understand that there is a pending
                    striking out application, <em>viz</em>, Summons
                    No 1778 of 2011 (“SUM1778/2011”) in S162/2011. The striking
                    out application has been taken out on the basis that the statement of claim
                    discloses no reasonable cause of action and/or is scandalous, frivolous or
                    vexatious and/or may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action
                    and/or is an abuse of process of the court. I make no comment on the merits of
                    the plaintiff’s claims which will be addressed in the hearing of
                    SUM1778/2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
