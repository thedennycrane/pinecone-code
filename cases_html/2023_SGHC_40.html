</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I then heard parties on three occasions: 17 January, 5 August and 17 October 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On 17 January 2022, Dr Chan appeared in person. After hearing the parties’ brief submissions, I decided to adjourn the hearing, primarily to allow Dr Chan time to take such steps as he thought necessary to regularise matters, including steps to purge his contempt and comply with the Order. Given the serious nature of the application, I adjourned the hearing also to allow Dr Chan the opportunity to appoint solicitors to represent him at the committal hearing, if he so desired. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 At the resumed hearing on 5 August 2022, Dr Chan was represented by his former solicitors, Millennium Law. I first heard and dismissed HC/SUM 1697/2022 (“SUM 1697”) with costs, giving brief oral grounds. SUM 1697 was an application by the first and second defendants for the Order to be varied by <span class="font-italic">removing</span> paragraphs 1, 2 and 11 from the Order. In brief, I found that a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction to the court that granted the Order lacked the power to do what Dr Chan sought in SUM 1697, which was to effectively <span class="font-italic">reverse</span> the Order, which itself was a final order granted pursuant to the plaintiff’s summary judgment application. In any event, there were also no grounds justifying a setting aside or variation of the Order, even assuming the court had the power to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I then continued to hear SUM 5179. Substantive arguments were ventilated, and in the course of the hearing, counsel for Dr Chan, Ms Debbie Lee (“Ms Lee”), claimed that there were other devices that they had handed over to Dr Chan’s expert for identification. However, this was not set out in any affidavit, including that of Dr Chan’s forensic expert. Following Ms Lee’s request, I adjourned the hearing again and allowed the first and second defendants to file a further affidavit to clarify what devices had been received by their expert, when, and from whom, and to explain the conclusions reached by the expert on whether those devices fell within the list of devices enumerated in the Order. The plaintiff was allowed to respond to the further affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The further affidavits were duly filed, and the matter came before me for the third time on 17 October 2022. At that hearing, Ms Lee fairly acknowledged that even as of 17 October 2022, full compliance had <span class="font-italic">not</span> been achieved. Instead, Ms Lee’s core argument was that Dr Chan’s efforts to-date ought to carry a mitigating effect on <span class="font-italic">sentencing</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 After hearing arguments on 17 October 2022, I reserved judgment. Subsequently, and in the course of my deliberations, it emerged that there was a potential issue on whether the requirements for service of the Order under O 45 r 7(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC had been complied with. I therefore directed that further submissions be tendered by the parties to address the point, which they did on 7 and 21 December 2022. I discuss this issue further from [36] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues and parties’ positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The two primary issues that arise for my consideration in SUM 5179 are:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether an order of committal ought to be made against Dr Chan, in his capacity as the first defendant and as the second defendant’s officer; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) if so, what sentence ought to be imposed on Dr Chan.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The first issue revolves around the defendants’ compliance with three sets of obligations, as summarised above at [16]:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the delivery up of personal laptops and external storage devices;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the transfer of the administration of the Vodien account; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the adding of CorpPass administrators.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I will address the parties’ positions on the state of compliance with each set of obligations in greater depth below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As for the second issue, it suffices to note that  the plaintiff’s solicitors sought a substantial term of imprisonment,

In my judgment, it is beyond dispute that this must be so. Dr Chan’s role and involvement in the second defendant (as its sole director), as well as his knowledge of the Order and the second defendant’s non-compliance, must mean that he was “by act or omission, knowingly concerned in, or … party to, the commission of [the second defendant’s] contempt” (s 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii)) and that he “knew or ought reasonably to have known that the contempt of court by the [second defendant] … would be or is being committed, and failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop the commission of that contempt of court” (s 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(iii)). I am therefore satisfied that if the second defendant had failed to comply with paragraph 2 of the Order, Dr Chan would be guilty of the same contempt of court as the second defendant, and would be liable to be punished accordingly on that basis (in addition to his <span class="font-italic">personal</span> breaches as the first defendant).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary issue on service</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Before analysing the alleged breaches, I address a preliminary procedural point as to whether the plaintiff has complied with O 45 r 7(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Plaintiff’s non-compliance with O 45 r 7(2)(</span>b<span class="font-italic">) of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 O 45 r 7(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) requires, “in the case of an order requiring a person to do an act,” that the order is “served before the expiration of the time within which he was required to do the act”.

Further, they arranged for a meeting on 21 July 2021 “to discuss [the defendants’] proposed amendments”.

</div>
</div> Order 45 rule 7(7) empowers the court to “dispense with service of a copy of an order under [O 45] if it thinks it just to do so”. For the following reasons, I agree that this is a proper case for service to be dispensed with, and I so order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The law is clear that a court can exercise its powers under O 45 r 7(7) retrospectively: <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v Burhan </span><span class="font-italic">Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 60 (“<span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>”) at [20]. In deciding whether to dispense with service, the court has a wide and unfettered discretion: <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities </span>at [23]. It will consider all circumstances, including in particular whether the defendant was already aware of or ought to have been aware of the order’s terms at the time of non-compliance: <span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Wan v Ho Poey Wee and others</span> [2015] SGHC 235 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Wan</span>”) at [13]. <span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Wan</span> moreover suggests that the circumstances identified under O 45 r 7(6) may be “useful but not exhaustive circumstances” for the court’s consideration, notwithstanding that r 7(6) is on its face concerned with prohibitory orders. The circumstances referred to in r 7(6) concern whether the contemnor already had notice of the order pending service, either by being present when the order was made, or by being notified of its terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my view, these principles are all designed to give effect to the central inquiry under O 45 r 7(7), namely, whether the court thinks it <span class="font-italic">just</span> to dispense with the requirement of service. The following three cases provide an illustration of when dispensation with the requirement of service would be just.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>, the applicant had failed to effect personal service and to serve penal notices (see [15] and [25]). The court nevertheless dispensed with the requirement of service as the contemnors were “undoubtedly aware” of the orders’ terms and alive to the consequences of non-compliance (at [25]). This was evidenced by the fact that the contemnors made various applications to forestall compliance with the disclosure orders and cross-examination. Further, the contemnors affirmed holding affidavits of assets, suggesting that they knew what was required of them under the Mareva injunction and the consequences of non-compliance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 <span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping Pte Ltd v Tay Sien Djim and others</span> [2014] SGHC 227 (“<span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping</span>”) was another case involving a failure to effect personal service altogether (see [112]). Similar to <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>, the court dispensed with the requirement of service as the contemnor was aware of the orders’ terms and alive to the consequences of non-compliance (at [113]). The contemnor admitted on cross-examination to having read the orders’ terms and the penal notices. The court found that the latest date on which the contemnor would have obtained notice of the orders was 8 September 2010 as he was already involved in preparing the third defendant’s defence by then. On 8 September 2010, the company (of which he was a director) was still in continuing breach of the Anton Piller order and Mareva injunction (at [113] and [120]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The facts in <span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Wan</span> come closer to the present case, being another case involving delayed service. The relevant order had been made on 1 August 2012 and ordered the contemnors to take certain steps by 24 September 2012. However, the order was only extracted on 19 September 2012 and served on the contemnors on 20 September 2012 (at [7]). Nevertheless, the court dispensed with the requirement of service as the contemnors admitted that their solicitors had explained the scope and substance of the order to them on 2 August 2012, one day after the order was made (at [18]). The delay in extracting and serving the order arose as parties needed to clarify its effect, which they did at a hearing on 3 September 2012 (at [6]). However, those clarifications did not pertain to the terms that were the subject of the breaches (at [16]–[17]). In other words, the contemnors already knew what was required of them just one day after the order was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On one view, the present case is somewhat trickier than <span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Wan</span> because the Order was served <span class="font-italic">after</span> the period for compliance had already fully elapsed. On another view,  it pales in contrast to <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span> and <span class="font-italic">Maruti Shipping</span>, where parties had omitted to serve the relevant orders at all. In my judgment, however, the pertinent question is not when (if at all) the relevant order was served; rather, the pertinent question is whether and when the contemnor gained knowledge of the order’s terms and the consequences of non-compliance. If a contemnor is in possession of such knowledge in time to comply with the relevant order, it would not be just for him or her to rely on a technical objection based on O 45 r 7(6) of the ROC to effectively evade his or her obligations under an order of court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Ms Lee appeared to frame the relevant inquiry differently, as whether the contemnor had deliberately disobeyed or defied the court’s order. Her submissions rely on this this proposition from <span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Wan </span>at [22]: “[i]n particular, whether the defendant was already aware of or ought to be aware of the terms of the court’s order at the time he failed to comply with it <span class="font-italic">so as to determine whether he had deliberately disobeyed or defied the court’s order</span> (beyond reasonable doubt) and whether enforcement by way of committal should be allowed to follow” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> On the basis that Dr Chan had tried his best to comply with the Order, Ms Lee contended that there had been no deliberate disobedience, and it would be unjust to dispense with the requirement of service. In my judgment, this argument misunderstands the notion of “deliberate” disobedience in the context of contempt of court, which focuses on the contemnor’s <span class="font-italic">knowledge</span> of the relevant order’s existence and terms, and of all the acts which make the relevant conduct a breach of the order (see [31] above). It is therefore no answer for Dr Chan to say that he had always acted <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> with best endeavours, or that it was never his intention to breach the Order. Instead, the focus ought to be on whether the defendant “was already aware of or ought to be aware of the terms of the court’s order at the time he failed to comply with it” (<span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Wan</span> at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the present facts, I am satisfied that Dr Chan knew of the Order’s terms and knew and/or was advised of the consequences of non-compliance on or around 12 July 2021 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of the Order).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 To begin with, as early as 5 April 2021, Chan J had made it clear that he would be making an order for delivery up, once certain issues as to the proper plaintiff in the Suit had been resolved:

</div> The defence was instead that Dr Chan faced practical challenges despite making best efforts to comply. Counsel’s submissions then proceeded (somewhat tangentially to my directions for further submissions) to rehash earlier arguments on the efforts that Dr Chan had made to comply with the Order. Be that as it may, there is sufficiently cogent evidence demonstrating that Dr Chan was, prior to 19 July 2021, aware of the Order and its terms, what he was required to do, and the consequences of non-compliance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 There is also no reason to doubt that Millennium Law would have duly communicated the court’s directions to Dr Chan, both from the 5 April 2021 hearing and following the 12 July 2021 hearing when the Order was made. Ms Lee had agreed to do so at the 5 April 2021 hearing. Millennium Law had every reason to do so, both as Dr Chan’s legal advisors, and as persons named in the Order who were required by the court to ensure that the devices were duly delivered up. The urgency of this task would have certainly been reinforced on 16 July 2021, when the plaintiff’s solicitors sent Millennium Law a letter reminding it of its clients’ obligations in respect of the personal laptops, external storage devices, Vodien account and CorpPass access. In each case, the letter expressly stated that the defendants had “until 19 July 2021 to deliver up the said laptops and external storage devices to [the defendant’s solicitors]”, that the plaintiff “await[ed] confirmation on 19 July 2021 that [the defendant’s solicitors] have received [the same]” and made Mr Goh and the company secretary CorpPass administrators, and that the plaintiff “expects to have access to the Vodien account on 19 July 2021”.

Indeed, it is material that it was Millennium Law who proposed a timeline of seven days for compliance at the 12 July 2021 hearing;

A further reason is that the delay in serving the Order on Dr Chan could hardly be attributable to the plaintiff’s solicitors. As described above at [39], the plaintiff’s solicitors had provided their proposed draft terms on 14 July 2021, just two days following the 12 July 2021 hearing, and sought comments and amendments by 16 July 2021. Millennium Law, however, only replied on 19 July 2021 – the final day for compliance with the Order. Even then, their response was not to confirm the draft terms, but to seek the plaintiff’s forbearance on the delivery up of devices and to seek further discussions as to the other terms. Having created the circumstances that led to the delay in the finalisation and service of the Order, it would, in my judgment, be most unjust for Dr Chan to now rely on that delay to avoid facing committal for non-compliance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Having dispensed with the requirement of service, I turn now to analyse the substance of the plaintiff’s allegations of non-compliance with the Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Liability in relation to the delivery up of personal laptops and external storage devices</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Personal laptops</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Under paragraph 1 of the Order, the first, third, fourth and sixth defendants were to deliver up their personal laptops.

If the sixth defendant never had a personal laptop, and there was soon to be an order of court for delivery up of that allegedly non-existent laptop (with the prospect that committal proceedings may follow in the event of non-compliance), it would have been an obvious and natural response for the sixth defendant to simply say so. And he could have said so – when the summary judgment proceedings were afoot, Millennium Law also represented the sixth defendant. It therefore stands to reason that Millennium Law would have also been taking instructions from the sixth defendant prior to the 12 July 2021 orders being made or confirmed. Even after the sixth defendant had been granted leave to file a further affidavit, there was no explanation in the affidavit for his earlier silence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I therefore find that paragraph 1 of the Order has been breached in respect of all four personal laptops. Further, since the second defendant (PILS) is, by paragraph 2 of the Order, liable for the delivery up of the personal laptops of the first, third, fourth and sixth defendants, the second defendant is likewise in breach of the Order.

However, after the dust had settled, the upshot is that Ms Lee accepts that there is non-compliance on the part of Dr Chan. The <span class="font-italic">extent</span> of non-compliance, however, was also initially less clear. I elaborate below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The extent of non-compliance depended on two factors. The first was the number of devices listed in the Order. There were 23 items in the list, but parties accepted that some may have been duplicates. This is a logical inference given how the list was constituted: it reflected the different devices that were believed to have been connected to the different work laptops. It may well be that the same external storage device (for example, a thumb drive) was used more than once across more than one laptop. However, this could not be verified without further investigation, as the same external storage device might show up under a different name when connected to a different laptop.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The other factor was the number of external storage devices from the list that were <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> delivered up.

There is therefore a compelling case of incomplete or imperfect compliance by Dr Chan. Moreover, inasmuch as nine external storage devices remain outstanding as of August 2022, it must be the case that <span class="font-italic">even more</span> external storage devices had not been delivered up at the material time on 19 July 2021, which was the last date for compliance permitted under the Order. Indeed, while it may not be the case that at least 18 devices remained undelivered (in so far as the Order’s list of external storage devices may contain duplicates), it is an established fact that <span class="font-italic">only five </span>external storage devices had been delivered up as of 21 July 2021 (see [68(a)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Regrettably, this unsatisfactory state of fluidity and imprecision was symptomatic of Dr Chan’s manner of non-compliance. It may be that coordinating efforts to locate and transfer external storage devices across multiple defendants presents logistical difficulties. It may also be that not all the external storage devices can be delivered up and sent for identification at one go. Yet, what was most lacking here was Dr Chan’s failure to even track and account for what <span class="font-italic">was</span> in his control – most pertinently a record of the steps that he had taken to comply with the delivery up order. There was limited clarity, for example, over when requests were made of the other defendants, on which dates, and inviting what replies. Neither was there a movement record of the devices that were received and that detailed when these were received by Dr Chan, when these were handed over to his solicitors, and when they were handed to the expert for identification. Instead, the court has been left to pull together and make sense of a stream of disparate information drip-fed sporadically across many months, well after compliance fell due in July 2021. This is a far cry from proper compliance with the Order, which was for delivery up to be effected within seven days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Dr Chan says that he faced “tremendous difficulties” complying with the orders to deliver up.

It is also fundamentally misleading: the onus was never on Mr Goh, and instead always on Dr Chan, to take steps to bring about compliance with the Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Dr Chan’s other defence, put forward in oral submissions by Ms Lee, is that Dr Chan still has some e-mails retained in his laptop, so the Vodien data is not all lost. I find this contention wholly unsatisfactory. For one, there is simply no way for anyone to compare and verify what fraction of the Vodien data the retained e-mails represent. Secondly, it does not afford any justification for Dr Chan’s failure to comply with the Order. Paragraph 9 of the Order was clear in its terms and did not allow Dr Chan an alternative method of compliance. It is therefore simply no answer for Dr Chan to now assert that some of the emails that could have been accessed from the Vodien account may be retrieved from his laptop.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Ultimately, Ms Lee had to accept that there <span class="font-italic">was</span> non-compliance on the face of the Order, but submitted that the court ought to take Dr Chan’s efforts into account in mitigation. While I address the question of sentencing more fully below (from [97] onwards), I find even this attenuated submission difficult to accept. Dr Chan’s efforts to comply (as I have detailed above) were, in my judgment, perfunctory at best. In the circumstances, and on the available evidence, there is a case to infer that his inaction was deliberate – to allow the account to lapse and permanently deprive the plaintiff and the court of any visibility over the data contained in the Vodien account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I therefore find that Dr Chan <span class="font-italic">qua</span> first defendant failed to comply with paragraph 9 of the Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Liability in relation to the CorpPass account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Finally, paragraph 10 of the Order required Dr Chan to add Mr Goh and the plaintiff’s company secretary as CorpPass administrators within seven days of the Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Dr Chan only requested for Mr Goh’s details on 5 August 2021, in reply to the plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter dated 29 July 2021.

In his 13 January 2022 affidavit, Dr Chan made several points: that he believed the sub-administrator role to be the same as the administrator role, save that it caters specially to foreigners without a SingPass account; that Mr Goh as sub-administrator would have been in a position to appoint himself and the corporate secretary as administrators; and that Dr Chan was in a position to approve new administrator accounts but had not seen any pending applications.

In its letter dated 16 July 2021 to Millennium Law, the plaintiff’s solicitors had already indicated that they would be “await[ing] confirmation on 19 July 2021 that [Dr Chan] has taken steps to ensure that” the account has been transferred.

</div>
</div> The ball was squarely back in Dr Chan’s court. However, there is no evidence of Dr Chan thereafter communicating what steps had been taken, or clarifying what steps Mr Goh needed to take, to complete the appointment of administrators. It does not lie in Dr Chan’s mouth to say that the plaintiff’s Ms Vivian Chen Wei An could have “easily solved” this issue and so she should have, on the basis that she had previously assisted with CorpPass and Vodien matters and would have had knowledge of them.

It would serve to nullify the profits sought and achieve proportionality with the contempt committed (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The consequences of a contemnor’s conduct, particularly to the innocent party, are also relevant. In my view, this is captured by the following two factors in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the reversibility of the breach – whether harm caused can be remedied by a fine and costs, or if there is substantial prejudice which cannot be remedied by costs (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [68(d)]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the purpose of the order breached and the impact of the breach on that purpose – for instance, a Mareva<span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction exists to prevent the dissipation of assets, but a breach thereof may be ameliorated by paying back the equivalent sum (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [68(f)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 More generally, the Court of Appeal has endorsed the following sentencing considerations for cases of contempt by disobedience in <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong</span> at [104], which overlap to some extent with the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>factors discussed above:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the claimant has been prejudiced by virtue of the contempt and whether the prejudice is capable of remedy;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the extent to which the contemnor has acted under pressure;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether the breach of the order was deliberate or unintentional;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the contemnor’s degree of culpability;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) whether the contemnor has been placed in breach of the order by reason of the conduct of others;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) whether the contemnor appreciates the seriousness of the deliberate breach; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(g) whether the contemnor has co-operated.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I apply these factors as may be relevant to this case around two broad themes: (a) Dr Chan’s conduct and reasons for non-compliance, and (b) the consequences of Dr Chan’s conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dr Chan’s conduct and reasons for non-compliance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In my view, the essence of the factors I have summarised at [103]–[104] above can be distilled to two related inquiries:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the steps that Dr Chan took (or did not take) to comply with the orders; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) his reasons for these acts and omissions.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I examine these questions compendiously, in respect of the personal laptops and external storage devices (paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Order), the Vodien account (paragraph 9 of the Order), and CorpPass account (paragraph 10 of the Order), <span class="font-italic">seriatim</span>. As will become clear below, I agree with the plaintiff that there were numerous aggravating factors at play.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In relation to the personal laptops and external storage devices, Dr Chan’s non-compliance continues to-date. By the time of the 17 October 2022 hearing (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when the plaintiff’s solicitors provided final confirmation that there remained nine items in the Order’s list of external storage devices that had not been produced), nearly 1 year and 3 months had elapsed since the date on which compliance fell due (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 19 July 2021). Moreover, this was over 1 year and 6 months from the 5 April 2021 hearing, when Chan J had directed Millennium Law to forewarn its clients to prepare their devices for delivery up. The earliest confirmation that some devices had been delivered up came only on 21 July 2021,

Yet, even that letter only referred to at most five external storage devices from the Order’s list of devices, and was sent past the deadline of 19 July 2021. Subsequent updates only came months later, and even then, only resulted in confusion as to the precise extent of compliance (see [68] above).

</div>
</div>
</div> This is a confusing statement, considering the earlier correspondence between both sets of solicitors making arrangements for the transfer (see [78]–[80] above). The “procedure of transferring the Vodien Server” would have simply been to continue with the arrangements already set in motion before the account expired. Dr Chan’s claim to innocence or ignorance as to the steps required to be taken is, in my view, exaggerated, and reflects his somewhat nonchalant attitude to complying with the Order. This is all the more troubling given that (from the available evidence) the transfer of the Vodien account should have been a relatively straightforward process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Less charitably, Dr Chan’s attitude could be described as going beyond nonchalance, to a deliberate attempt to prejudice the plaintiff. As I found above at [83], [84] and [87], Dr Chan would have known that the account was expiring. What one would have expected him to do is to make arrangements for the renewal fee to be paid. Short of a plausible explanation to the contrary, his omission to renew the account raises, in my judgment, an inference that his inaction was deliberate, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to allow the account to lapse, and thereby deprive the plaintiff and the court of any real visibility over the data and information contained in the Vodien account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Ms Lee submitted that there was no sinister intention to allow the account to lapse, and that the lapse arose because Dr Chan had “limited resources and as an individual he could not handle so many issues at the same time”.

</div>
</div>
</div> This contention is factually doubtful. In or around July and August 2021, when the relevant enquiries were being made with Vodien, Dr Chan was legally represented. As to his limited financial resources, for the reasons set out above at [84], I do not accept this to be a legitimate excuse for his inaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 As to the CorpPass account, Dr Chan’s attitude to compliance can be described as nonchalant at best. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Even though steps were taken to grant Mr Goh sub-administrator status on around 12 August 2021, it was only months later in January 2022 that further steps were taken that enabled Mr Goh to be made an administrator. The Order was clear on its face that Mr Goh had to be made an administrator (and nothing less), but that was only accomplished in January 2022. On the available evidence, and as I described above at [93] and [94], the reason for these delays stems materially from Dr Chan’s conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Ms Lee submitted that making Mr Goh a sub-administrator amounts to at least partial compliance. In my view, it is unclear if this is in fact so in substance, and Dr Chan bears the burden of demonstrating that it is. It is unclear if a sub-administrator has substantially the same rights as an administrator, and in turn, whether that act (of making Mr Goh a sub-administrator) substantially gave effect to the reasons for which the Order was made. There is simply no evidence before the court to substantiate what are in effect bare assertions by Dr Chan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Against the backdrop of all these considerations, I also note that Dr Chan has not expressed any sincere remorse for his conduct. Instead, Dr Chan made efforts at almost every turn to excuse his inadequacies and/or pin the blame on other persons. That being said, I acknowledge that the <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of remorse is not normally aggravating; rather, it is aggravating only where the lack of remorse points to a contumacious breach which the contemnor has no intention to remedy (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [68(g)]). In my judgment, the present case does not go that far. Some of the breaches may have been continuing and even now not substantially purged, but the fact that a patchwork of efforts has been taken indicates that this is not a case where there is plainly <span class="font-italic">no</span> intention to remedy the breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In summary, the picture that emerges from my foregoing analysis is one of nonchalance and/or disregard for the need to comply with an order of court, and in respect of the Vodien account in particular, a deliberate attempt to put evidence out of the plaintiff’s reach. It also calls to mind the observation at [68(f)] of <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> that “[a] breach that had been planned, taking into account the cost of the fine, and which had been conducted over a period of time when there had been numerous opportunities to stop the contemptuous behaviour would be serious enough to ground a custodial sentence”. This punitive angle is also matched by coercive considerations. As explained above, Dr Chan’s breaches of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Order are continuing breaches, with some nine external storage devices still unaccounted for. As the Court of Appeal held at [103] of <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong</span>, where a contemnor is ordered to do an act but continuously refuses to comply, “the objective of compelling the contemnor to effect compliance with the order is likely to be given a significant degree of weight”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In combination, all of these considerations are aggravating, and in my judgment, justify the imposition of a prison term.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The consequences of Dr Chan’s conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Ms Lee accepts that there has been some prejudice caused to the plaintiff.

</div> In my assessment, the prejudice was not insubstantial. This too is aggravating. As before, I proceed to examine the consequences of Dr Chan’s conduct in relation to the personal laptops and external storage devices, the Vodien account, and the CorpPass account, in that order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In relation to the personal laptops and external storage devices, there remains till this day incomplete delivery up. It bears emphasising that the remedy granted in the delivery up order is a <span class="font-italic">final</span> one. There has been a final determination, by way of summary judgment proceedings, of the plaintiff’s substantive rights to delivery up of the personal laptops and external storage devices. This was not a discovery order that only affects the plaintiff’s prosecution of its claims; it goes directly to its business and a vindication of its substantive rights that had been determined finally in its favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 With the purpose of the Order in mind, I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that Dr Chan’s breaches operated “with a view to deprive the [plaintiff] of the fruits of the litigation [that it had successfully obtained through] summary judgment”.

Given how paragraph 3 of the Order was structured, forensic investigations would only commence after Millennium Law delivered up the personal laptops and external storage devices to the forensic expert appointed by the plaintiff. The pace at which delivery up took place also conceivably hampered the plaintiff’s ability to vigorously pursue investigations. In my view, the plaintiff makes a fair submission that it was “not able to move on with the trial process because of the committal proceedings [as it was] waiting for the devices to be handed to the forensic experts for analysis so that [it knew] what data [was] in them”.

</div> this does not ameliorate the forensic challenge posed to the plaintiff and the court. As I mentioned above at [86], there ultimately remains no way for anyone to verify what fraction of the original Vodien data the retained e-mails represent. It also does not address the prejudice caused to the plaintiff in respect of another plank of its case: that Dr Chan had wrongfully refused Mr Goh access to the Vodien server, despite requests for the same to be granted. In the plaintiff’s amended Statement of Claim, this refusal is couched as a breach of the Service Agreement and of Dr Chan’s fiduciary duties to protect the plaintiff’s interests.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) dated 22 September 2020 at para 47.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Dr Chan’s defence appears, in part, to be that access to the server was not necessary for Mr Goh because all the relevant work product and information had already been handed to the plaintiff by other means. The permanent loss of access to the data in the Vodien account would, in my view, pose an obstacle to the plaintiff and the court, in testing the veracity of this defence.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 As to the CorpPass account, I accept that the type and extent of prejudice caused is less clear. To the extent that this access was sought before and granted by Chan J for the purposes of regulatory compliance, one would expect any prejudice to be measured in terms of the consequences arising from regulatory non-compliance, such as administrative penalties. The plaintiff has, however, not adduced any evidence of having suffered any such consequences. In my view, the consequences of Dr Chan’s delay in complying with this part of the Order operate as a neutral factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In sum, in respect of the devices and Vodien accounts at least, the serious consequences visited upon the plaintiff by Dr Chan’s breaches should be considered aggravating. In my judgment, these add further justification to the imposition of a prison term.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Given the aggravating factors I have identified, it is clear to me that both punitive and coercive considerations warrant the imposition of a term of imprisonment, at least in relation to the orders for delivery up and the transfer of the Vodien account (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, paragraphs 1, 2 and 9 of the Order). As to the CorpPass account (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>paragraph 10 of the Order), having regard to the absence of any demonstrable prejudice and the fact that the account was fully transferred by January 2022, I am prepared to impose a fine for non-compliance with paragraph 10 of the Order (see [142] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 As for the length of imprisonment, I find the case of <span class="font-italic">Brightex</span> to be instructive. As in the present case, the first defendant in <span class="font-italic">Brightex</span> gained access to confidential and business sensitive information in the course of his work, and prior to his resignation from the plaintiff company, copied copious amounts of data into his personal storage. He had moreover sent confidential data to the second and third defendants. The plaintiff sought and obtained an injunction to prevent the further unauthorised use and dissemination of its confidential information, and this included an order for delivery up of the confidential information and an order for disclosure of all prior unauthorised usage and/or disclosure of the information. Delivery up was due by 13 July 2018, but the data submitted on 12 and 13 July 2018 was incomplete, and remained so even across subsequent meetings and hearings. The disclosure order was also breached: forensic examinations showed that multiple communications between the defendants had not been disclosed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The High Court found that the first defendant’s behaviour exhibited several aggravating factors, including a deliberate and persistent failure to comply over the course of several months. The first defendant’s explanations for non-compliance were unconvincing. He would have known of his conduct’s serious impact on the plaintiff’s business. Nevertheless, the court was minded to impose a prison sentence of 14 days, having regard to the first defendant’s attempts to cooperate and purge his contempt, and the plaintiff’s ability to ameliorate some of the prejudice caused (<span class="font-italic">Brightex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [62]–[64] and [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 On appeal, the Court of Appeal dismissed the contemnor’s appeal against his conviction, but allowed the plaintiff’s cross-appeal on sentence. It substituted the 14 days’ imprisonment term with a sentence of three months’ imprisonment. The Court of Appeal noted that the first defendant, in deliberately breaching the court orders, had been motivated by financial gain. Further, the plaintiff had suffered prejudice as a result, and no remorse was demonstrated by the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 On my reading of <span class="font-italic">Brightex</span>, emphasis was placed on the contemnor’s continued pattern of deliberate non-compliance, and the prejudice this caused to the plaintiff’s business interests. These aspects bear a strong similarity to the present case, save perhaps that the contemnor’s financial motivations (through his disclosure of the confidential information to the other defendants) appeared to be clearer in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Brightex. </span>In addition, in <span class="font-italic">Brightex</span>, the further breach of the disclosure order would have also been factored in by the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The plaintiff also referred to <span class="font-italic">Technigroup</span>, but the circumstances in that case were, in my view, more aggravated. In <span class="font-italic">Technigroup</span>, the first and second defendants each faced a four month prison term for repeated breaches of specific discovery orders (which sentences were suspended for them to attempt to purge the contempt). What is striking from the judgment (at [1], [6], [7] and [99]) are the deliberate and persistent efforts by the first and second defendants to perpetuate falsehoods, in denying the existence of certain related entities and the documents thereof. At [109], the court highlighted in the context of sentencing the need to consider not only the extent of non-disclosure, but also whether any positively misleading disclosure had been made, such as a pretence that complete disclosure had been given. This could impact the court’s assessment of the nature of the breach and/or the prejudice to the other party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Viewed in this light, Dr Chan’s culpability is, in my judgment, less severe than that of the contemnors in <span class="font-italic">Technigroup</span>. Granted, the failure to transfer rights over the Vodien account appears (as I have found) to have been a deliberate and strategic attempt to take the Vodien data out of the plaintiff’s hands. However, in relation to the delivery up of devices, Dr Chan’s failures reflect nonchalance and neglect, not outright falsification or deception as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Technigroup</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Having regard to the circumstances of this case and the precedents referred to above, in my judgment, a sentence of two months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the failure to deliver up the personal laptops and external storage devices and the failure to transfer the Vodien account. This sentence takes appropriate account, on the one hand, of the continuing nature of Dr Chan’s breaches and the serious prejudice they have caused, and on the other, of the fact that some attempts have been made in the months since to comply with the Order and purge the contempt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 For the reasons above, I order that the requirement of service of the Order under O 45 of the ROC is dispensed with pursuant to O 45 r 7(7) of the ROC. On the breaches alleged (see [27] above), I find Dr Chan liable for contempt in intentionally disobeying paragraphs 1, 2, 9 and 10 of the Order, both in his personal capacity (in relation to paragraphs 1, 9 and 10 of the Order) and as the sole director of the second defendant, PILS (in relation to paragraph 2 of the Order). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 As regards prayer 1 of SUM 5179, I sentence Dr Chan to imprisonment for a term of two months for the breaches of paragraphs 1, 2 and 9 of the Order. As for the breach of paragraph 10 of the Order, I impose a fine on Dr Chan of $2,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I further order Dr Chan to surrender his passport to the Sheriff of the Supreme Court forthwith and to present himself to the Sheriff at 10am on 7 March 2023 to begin his term of imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Finally, the plaintiff also sought an order that Dr Chan pay the plaintiff costs of and incidental to the application. Following the hearing of SUM 4653 (the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> application for leave to commence committal proceedings), I reserved the question of costs of SUM 4653 to the hearing of SUM 5179. With regard to both applications, Ms See Tow argued for costs at the top end of the range in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, the range being $4,000–$16,000 for committal applications. The figure of $16,000 sought was in addition to $1,100 for disbursements. Ms Lee on the other hand submitted that costs should be fixed at the lowest end of that range, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, at $4,000, but ultimately left it to the court to determine the appropriate quantum of costs. Having heard the parties, I fix costs of both applications in the sum of $15,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by Dr Chan to the plaintiff. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S Mohan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">See Tow Soo Ling and Sambhavi Rajangam (CNPLaw LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Mei Yong Debbie (Millennium Law LLC) for the 1st and 2nd defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-center font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
