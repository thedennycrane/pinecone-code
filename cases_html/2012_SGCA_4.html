        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the assessment of
                    damages made by the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) in a suit
                    instituted by the Appellant, who was injured in a motor accident where the
                    Appellant was a pedestrian and the Respondent was the driver of a
                taxi.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 2 January 2005, the Appellant was
                    crossing Jurong East Ave 1 at a pedestrian crossing when he was knocked down by
                    the Respondent’s taxi. At the time of the accident, the Appellant was aged
                    18 and was just about to commence his second and final year at Anglo-Chinese
                    Junior College (“ACJC”). He was severely injured and was admitted
                    to the National University of Singapore Hospital (“NUH”) where an
                    emergency craniotomy was carried out to remove large blood clots from his brain.
                    He was in a coma for some 17 days. On 15 February 2005, he was transferred
                    to Tan Tock Seng Rehabilitation Centre where he remained for rehabilitation
                    until 10 June 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 11 April 2006, the Appellant commenced
                    Suit No 215 of 2006 against the Respondent. On 31 January 2008, by consent,
                    interlocutory judgment was entered in the Appellant’s favour with the
                    Respondent being held 75% liable for the accident. On 12 March 2009, as the
                    Appellant still could not manage himself and his affairs, his father was
                    appointed, pursuant to the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (Cap 178,
                    1985 Rev Ed), as his Committee of Person and Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The assessment of damages was carried out by the
                    Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) in 2009 and damages were eventually
                    assessed at a total of $1.3m (on a 100% liability basis). Both parties were
                    dissatisfied with the AR’s decision, with the Respondent filing an appeal
                    in Registrar’s Appeal No 440 of 2009 (“RA 440/2009”) and the
                    Appellant filing an appeal in Registrar’s Appeal No 445 of 2009
                    (“RA 445/2009”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The medical evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As to be expected, much of the evidence adduced
                    at the assessment was of a medical nature. Dr Lai Chan See
                    (“Dr Lai”), a specialist in occupational medicine engaged by
                    the Respondent’s lawyers, stated that the physical injuries suffered by
                    the Appellant from the accident were the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
              •
                Severe traumatic head injuries, with</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) fracture of the left zygoma and fracture of the left temporal bone
                            that extended to the base of skull</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) large left parieto-temporal extradural haematoma with severe mass
                            effect that caused a midline shift of the brain,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) bilateral frontal subdural haematomas</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) subarachnoid haemorrhage</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) right brain contusion, and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
              •
                Fracture of the
                                6<sup>th</sup> cervical vertebra</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Emergency craniotomy was done to remove the extradural and subdural
                        haematomas. Post-operative scans revealed that the massive extradural
                        haematoma had caused a kinking of the posterior cerebral artery as it ran
                        over the tentorium, leading to infarction [tissue death due to lack of
                        oxygen] of that part of the brain supplied by this artery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the post-operative period, he developed bacteraemia, pneumonia and
                        urinary tract infection requiring antibiotic therapy. He also had seizures
                        that required anticonvulsants for control. Tracheostomy was done on
                        12.01.2005 so that he could be mechanically ventilated through a respirator.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In December 2008, nearly four years after the
                    accident, Dr Lai noted that the following physical and cognitive
                    disabilities still remained<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[C]ognitive impairment affecting his memory, concentration and
                        reasoning</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[S]peech impairment with dysphasia and dysarthria</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[L]eft lateral squint</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]mpairment of sphincteric control resulting in urinary and bowel
                        urgency</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Lai stated that these impairments were permanent. For a better
                    understanding of the Appellant’s continuing cognitive disabilities, the
                    following part of Dr Lai’s report is pertinent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">His memory is poor – he recalled only two out of six shopping items
                        given to him after a lapse of ten minutes. His concentration is also poor.
                        He gave up doing the serial-7 subtraction test after only four attempts
                        (100, 93, <b><em>87</em></b>, <b><em>69</em></b>, then gave up). He expects a return of $1.30 change on
                        giving a $10.00 note to buy a bottle of coffee powder costing $8.90. He
                        tires easily, yawning repeatedly during the latter half of the consultation.
                        Although his passion is in art and after studying a year in an art school he
                        cannot name a single Singaporean artist. He knows the names of a few western
                        artists – Dali, Monet, Rambrandt [<em>sic</em>],
                        Van Gogh – but cannot give a simple description of their painting
                        styles. On a couple of occasions he talked about God, which was out of
                        context with the topic at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold italics in original]</p>

                    Intelligence Scale – Third Edition in September 2008 had the following
                        results<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The Appellant’s] skills in understanding verbal information,
                        thinking with words and expressing thoughts in words (VIQ) are classified as
                        being in the ‘Borderline’ to ‘Low Average’ range and
                        ranked in the 10th percentile. His skills in solving non-verbal problems, in
                        working quickly and efficiently with visual information (PIQ) are classified
                        as being in the ‘Average’ range and ranked in the
                            42<sup>nd</sup> percentile. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on an analysis of the individual subtests, it appears that [the
                        Appellant] <em>fared much better on tasks that tapped on
                            nonverbal reasoning </em><em>... and that required
                            him to recall facts that he had learnt previously </em><em>…</em> . However <em>when it came
                            to tasks that required verbal reasoning and expressive language

                            on these subtests was significantly weaker. Moreover he also displayed
                            significant difficulties with tasks that tapped on attention and working
                            memory</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As for psychological disabilities,
                    Dr Adrian Wang Chee Cheng (“Dr Wang”), a consultant
                    psychiatrist, testified that when he first examined the Appellant in August 2008
                    (about three and a half years after the accident), the latter had a diminished
                    sense of self-restraint, impaired judgment, increased impulsivity and occasional
                    temper outbursts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.
                    Dr Wang diagnosed the Appellant as suffering from “organic brain
                    syndrome” with an increased risk of developing depressive, anxiety and
                    psychotic disorders. In a subsequent consultation in October 2008, Dr Wang
                    concluded that the Appellant had, in addition, developed “organic
                    psychosis” which manifested itself in disorganised speech and rambling,
                    and undue suspicion and paranoia<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In determining the damages for pain and
                    suffering, the AR preferred the component approach over the global approach
                    where, as in this case, “the resultant deficits are identifiable and
                    discrete”. She awarded damages in the sum of $285,000, made up as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     in respect of structural damage to
                        the whole body, $80,000. She added that the Appellant’s head injuries
                        were no less serious than those in <em>Tan Yu Min Winston (by
                            his next friend Tan Cheng Tong) v Uni-Fruitveg Pte Ltd</em> [2008]

                        Tan</em>”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     in respect of psychological damage, $60,000. She noted
                        that the injury to the frontal lobe of the brain left the Appellant with
                        mood instability and changes in personality and outlook;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     in respect of cognitive damage and
                        post-traumatic amnesia, $80,000. She noted that there was no way that the
                        Appellant could resume mainstream education and that he struggled to cope
                        with his art course at LaSalle College of the Arts
                        (“LaSalle”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     for bladder and bowel dysfunction, $20,000;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     for loss of
                        motor function and residual spasticity, $45,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     However, the Judge held that this award of
                    $285,000 was “unjustified” (see <em>Lee Wei Kong
                        (by his </em><em>litigation representative Lee Swee
                        Chit) v Ng Siok Tong</em> [2010] SGHC 371
                    (“Judgment”) at [20]). He
                    stated that the component approach and the global approach were not functionally
                    distinct: while the global approach arrives at a global figure after taking into
                    account the component figures, the component approach starts by adding up the
                    component figures and ends by ensuring that the aggregate amount is reasonably
                    reflective of the totality of the injury (Judgment at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Judge noted that, as in <em>Winston Tan</em>, no precedents were cited by the AR in support of
                    her awards on the various components (Judgment at [17]). He found that there were five helpful precedents where
                    the awards were arrived at on a global basis. Of the five cases, two were
                    particularly helpful. <em>Toon Chee Meng Eddie v Yeap Chin
                        Hon</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 407 (“<em>Eddie Toon</em>”) presented the most serious injuries, and the
                    plaintiff was awarded $160,000 for pain and suffering in 1993. <em>Chong </em><em>Hwa </em><em>Yin (committee of person and estate of </em><em>Chong </em><em>Hwa </em><em>Wee, mentally disordered) v Estate of Loh Hon Fock,
                        deceased</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 208 presented injuries which
                    were most similar to that suffered by the Appellant, and the plaintiff there was
                    awarded $120,000 in 2006. After considering the cases, taking into account the
                    different types of injuries and residual disabilities, their respective degrees
                    of severity, the vintage of the awards and the ages of the plaintiffs in those
                    cases, the Judge reduced the AR’s award to $160,000, representing a
                    reduction of $125,000 (Judgment at [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Before us, the Appellant advances two
                    arguments against the reduction made by the Judge on this head of damage:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Judge erred in law by
                        having regard to cases which were decided using the “global
                        approach” and/or which were not comparable to the injuries and
                        disabilities suffered by the Appellant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the Judge erred in fact by failing to
                        accord sufficient weight to the injuries and disabilities suffered by the
                        Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the other hand, the Respondent argues that
                    the Judge was not manifestly wrong in his factual finding: he had clearly taken
                    into account the severity of the Appellant’s injuries and residual
                    disabilities, and the fact that the Appellant had made great improvements since
                    the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The decision of this court in <em>Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 587 (“<em>Samuel Chai</em>”)
                    (at [48]) established that the component
                    approach is no more than a systematic instrument to aid the court to determine
                    what would be a fair and reasonable quantification for a particular injury or
                    disability, having regard to precedents. Therefore, previous cases will still
                    remain relevant insofar as the particular injuries or post-accident residual
                    disabilities are sufficiently similar: they provide the backdrop in which the
                    court can place the award in order to determine whether it represents a
                    reasonable sum reflective of the totality of the injury. We, therefore, are
                    unable to accept the Appellant’s argument that the Judge was wrong in law
                    to have considered cases that had been decided using the global
                approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The remaining issue which we need to consider
                    is whether the Judge had failed to accord sufficient weight to the injuries and
                    residual disabilities suffered by the Appellant in coming to his decision. It is
                    well-settled that this court will not interfere with an award of damages merely
                    because it is of the opinion that a different amount might be more appropriate:
                    see <em>Chow Khai Hong v Tham </em><em>Sek
                        </em><em>Khow and another</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 670 and Jeffrey Pinsler SC gen ed, <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) at
                    para 57/1/16. Of the cases reviewed by the Judge, <em>Muhamad </em><em>Ilyas Bin Mirza Abdul Hamid v Kwek
                        </em><em>Khim </em><em>Hui</em> [2004] SGHC 12 (“<em>Muhamad
                        </em><em>Ilyas</em>”), where only $80,000
                    was awarded, was a case where the residual mental disabilities suffered by the
                    plaintiff were significantly less severe (<em>ie</em>, he
                    was still highly intelligent and suffered no deterioration in IQ, except for
                    some memory deterioration) and he suffered little residual physical
                    disabilities. In contrast, the injuries suffered by the plaintiff in <em>Eddie Toon</em> (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                    above), a case decided in 1993, were comparatively the most serious. There, the
                    plaintiff, who was seven and a half years of age at the time of the accident,
                    had suffered a fractured left skull with underlying brain damage, was paralysed
                    on the right side of his body, and was unable to walk or speak. He also suffered
                    from epilepsy, minimal control over his bladder and bowels, and had the
                    intellectual ability of a six-month to one-year old child. The High Court upheld
                    an award of $160,000. Lastly, in <em>Koh Chai Kwang v Teo Ai Ling
                        (by her next friend, Chua Wee Bee)</em> [2011] 3 SLR 610
                        (“<em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em>”) (at [68]),
                    this court held that a total award of $110,000 to the plaintiff for pain and
                    suffering (comprising $70,000 for physical injuries and $40,000 for cognitive
                    injuries) was not manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     There has not been any case where, for pain
                    and suffering, an award close to $285,000 had been made. While we recognise that
                    the physical injuries and mental disabilities suffered by the Appellant here are
                    not the same as those in the three cases discussed above, some aspects are more
                    severe while other aspects are less severe. Taking a broad view of things, we do
                    not think that the Judge’s award of $160,000 could be regarded as being
                    manifestly inadequate. We thus will not disturb the Judge’s finding on
                    this head of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Loss of earning capacity/Loss of future earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As regards what <em>seemed to
                        be an award for loss of earning capacity</em>, the AR explained her
                    award of $600,000 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Given the current state of the patient, I think it is fair to
                        assume that he will not be able to undertake any employment that requires
                        advanced cognitive skill or fine motor skills. This effectively rules out a
                        professional course. ... In my opinion, the greatest deficit for the patient
                        is mental rather than physical. ... It would appear that the patient might
                        however, with perhaps some assistance, be able to take on some routine or
                        rudimentary work in future that would provide some minimum wage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have also considered that the patient is of a very young age, 22 years
                        old, and has a long road ahead of him. In this regard, I am making an award
                        of $600,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We will explain later (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>
                    below) why we say this “seemed to be an award for loss of earning
                    capacity” and its significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Judge noted that the AR did not explain
                    how she arrived at the amount of $600,000 and that the Appellant had failed to
                    cite a single precedent to support his claim for $800,000 before the AR. In
                    arriving at his decision, the Judge stated that the salient features of the
                    present case were as follows (Judgment at [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Appellant could undertake simple
                        undemanding employment, but would not be able to work and earn at the level
                        of a person who had completed his secondary education (which he had) or
                        junior college education (which he probably would have, but for the
                        accident);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        Appellant’s ability to work was significantly diminished and this
                        diminution extended over the whole of his working life;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        Appellant’s potential earning level without the diminution was
                        uncertain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge also took into account four recent
                    cases in which awards of between $100,000 and $180,000 were made for loss of
                    earning capacity (“LEC”). He noted that before these cases, such
                    awards were conservative, citing <em>Assessment of Damages:
                        Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents</em> (LexisNexis, 2001, 1st Ed)
                    which listed 52 awards made between the years 1990 and 2000, with the highest at
                    $75,000. The Judge accordingly substituted the AR’s award of $600,000 with
                    an award of $250,000 (Judgment at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Before us, the Appellant’s essential
                    point is that the Judge erred in law by relying on cases with dissimilar facts,
                    and by failing to have regard to <em>Winston Tan</em> (at
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), <em>Samuel
                        Chai</em> (at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above) and the
                    High Court’s decision in <em>Teo Ai Ling (by her next
                        friend Chua Wee Bee) v Koh Chai Kwang</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1037
                        (“<em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em>”). The
                    Appellant also argues that the Judge erred by failing to accord sufficient
                    weight to the evidence of the Appellant’s severe handicap in the labour
                    market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Respondent argues that the High
                    Court’s approach in <em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em> cannot
                    be applied in this case because there was insufficient evidence here to adopt a
                    multiplier/multiplicand method of calculation. The Respondent also argues that
                    the precedents which dealt with LEC are instructive in establishing the pattern
                    and limits of such awards. He emphasised that the AR’s award was wholly
                    out of line with the precedents and that the Judge’s award of $250,000 is
                    now the highest reported award for LEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We agree with the Judge that <em>prima facie</em>, the AR’s award of $600,000 for LEC
                    does in fact appear manifestly excessive in light of the previous case law where
                    a maximum of $180,000 was awarded in <em>Nirumalan V Kanapathi
                        </em><em>Pillay v Teo Eng Chuan</em> [2003]
                    3 SLR(R) 601 (“<em>Nirumalan</em>”). Indeed, the Judge noted that his award of
                    $180,000 in <em>Nirumalan</em> “was higher than it
                    should have been” (Judgment at [38]). At this point, we observe that in examining the amounts
                    awarded in past cases, especially those made before 2000, one must not overlook
                    the significant changes in the purchasing power per unit of currency and the
                    state of the labour market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Awards of $100,000 for LEC were made in
                        <em>Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong</em> [2008]
                    1 SLR(R) 178 (“<em>Ronnie
                    Tan</em>”), <em>Muhamad </em><em>Ilyas</em> (at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>
                    above) and <em>Winston Tan</em> (at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). <em>Ronnie
                        Tan</em> was a case involving a lawyer who was earning $10,000 monthly
                    before the accident and whose cognitive abilities and knowledge were not
                    impaired. By contrast, in <em>Nirumalan</em>, the plaintiff
                    was a lawyer who was earning an even greater amount of $35,000 per month. While
                    he did not suffer any immediate loss of income, the court found that the
                    injuries suffered by the plaintiff in <em>Nirumalan</em>
                    did affect his ability to work. For this reason, the court awarded him $180,000
                    for LEC. In <em>Muhamad </em><em>Ilyas</em>, the plaintiff (who was serving his National Service) was
                    still very intelligent after the accident and he still possessed the
                    prerequisites to be exceptionally successful at whatever career he chose to
                    pursue, although there was some deterioration in his memory function. In
                        <em>Winston Tan</em>, the High Court found that, after
                    the accident, the plaintiff continued to perform slightly above average in his
                    ‘O’ Level examinations and at his polytechnic. Although the
                    plaintiff in <em>Winston Tan</em> was slightly handicapped
                    in terms of memory function and cognitive ability, the court found that these
                    residual disabilities were not a major stumbling block preventing the plaintiff
                    from making further progress and achieving his employment goals. In comparison
                    with these four precedents, two distinguishing features must be noted as regards
                    the Appellant. First, at the time of the accident, the Appellant was only a
                    junior college student and had yet to embark upon any employment. Secondly, the
                    Appellant’s cognitive and psychological disabilities were much more severe
                    than those suffered by the plaintiffs in each of those four precedents. These
                    are factors which would have a bearing on the quantum of LEC to be awarded to
                    the Appellant or would have a bearing on the grant of damages under a different
                    basis, such as that for loss of future earnings
                (“LFE”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     At this juncture, we refer to two more recent
                    cases for illustrative purposes, <em>viz</em>, <em>Samuel Chai</em> (at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    above) and <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> (at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above). Both cases were not referred to by
                    the Judge. However, we must add that this court’s decision in <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> was published after the Judge had made
                    his decision in this case. In <em>Samuel Chai</em>, the AR
                    awarded A$15,000 for LEC, but this was increased to A$50,000 by the High Court.
                    On appeal, this court reinstated the AR’s award of A$15,000, primarily on
                    the basis that the plaintiff was not really disadvantaged by her injuries. As
                    such, there was a low risk that she would be unable to obtain another job. The
                    long-term disabilities suffered by the plaintiff in <em>Samuel
                        Chai</em> were primarily physical in the sense that she found
                    sustained periods of work to be too painful and exhausting. More importantly,
                    the plaintiff there did not suffer from long-term cognitive or psychological
                    disabilities because she had an excellent recovery after the
                accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     
          <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em>
                    involved a polytechnic student who failed to complete her course because of her
                    head injuries. The AR in that case awarded $120,000 for LEC. The High Court
                    substituted this award with one for LFE valued at $492,000. On further appeal by
                    the defendant, this court reinstated the AR’s award for LEC at $120,000 on
                    a provisional basis, invoking the power conferred upon the court under paragraph
                    16 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,
                    2007 Rev Ed) to make such an award. The effect of the provisional award was
                    that if the plaintiff’s monthly income should, in four to six years’
                    time, be shown to be less than $1,832, the damages due to the plaintiff would be
                    recomputed on the basis of LFE, with a deduction being made for the sum of
                    $120,000 already paid provisionally as LEC to the plaintiff. This approach would
                    ensure that there is minimal likelihood of overpayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>Teo Ai Ling
                        (CA)</em>, the plaintiff suffered from significant cognitive
                    impairment to the extent that she had difficulty finding her way around her
                    polytechnic campus even with the aid of a map. The AR in that case, after
                    hearing the medical evidence, thought that there was a real possibility that she
                    might fail her polytechnic examinations (as she in fact did) due to her
                    cognitive impairment. Her ability to remember things was significantly affected.
                        <em>Prima facie</em>, <em>Teo Ai Ling
                        (CA)</em> resembles the present case more closely than all the other
                    cases cited. As indicated earlier (at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>
                    above), the award given by the AR in that case for LEC at $120,000 was
                    substituted by the High Court with an award for LFE at $492,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Having reviewed the precedents, it would
                    appear that the Judge’s award of $250,000 in the present case as LEC is
                    high. But viewed in the context of the disabilities suffered by the Appellant,
                    where his capacity to work and earn has been almost destroyed, except for the
                    ability to carry out some very simple tasks, the quantum is inadequate. It seems
                    to us that the present case may not be an instance where damages should be
                    awarded on the basis of LEC; it should instead be awarded on the basis of LFE
                    (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> below). As mentioned (at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above), the Appellant’s memory and cognitive
                    abilities are so badly impaired that he can no longer do the work which a person
                    with ‘O’ Level qualifications could have done. Indeed, based on the
                    evidence from the principal of ACJC (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> below), it is reasonable to assume that the Appellant would
                    have, but for the accident, passed the ‘A’ Level examinations.
                    Following from that, the Appellant would have had a fair chance of pursuing
                    tertiary education. This is a relevant factor towards determining the kind of
                    employment that the Appellant would have, in all likelihood, been able to engage
                    in but for the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We will now turn to consider some
                    circumstances which suggest that the parties, as well as the AR, regarded LEC
                    and LFE as being similar or synonymous. In the statement of claim, the Appellant
                    claimed damages for “loss of earning capacity”. In his closing
                    submissions before the AR, the Respondent stated (at para 66) that
                    “counsel for the [Appellant] had informed the Court that the [Appellant]
                    is looking at a sum of $800,000.00 for loss of future earnings/loss of earning
                    capacity based on the case of [<em>Winston
                    Tan</em>]” and went on to state (at para 73) that “the
                    [Respondent] submits that an award made to the [Appellant] for loss of earning
                    capacity/loss of future earnings should not exceed a sum of $150,000.00 to
                    $180,000.00”. In the AR’s grounds of decision, she held that
                    “In terms of [the Appellant’s] future earnings, I accept that an
                    appropriate award in this case should be one for loss of earning capacity,
                    rather than loss of future earnings”. Yet, in the formal judgment that
                    was extracted, this sum was listed as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii)  
              <u>Loss of future earnings</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(k) $600,000.00 for loss of future earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the AR did not expressly state the basis upon
                    which she arrived at the sum of $600,000, we are inclined to think that she must
                    have adopted the multiplicand/multiplier method, which is what the courts would
                    typically do when making an award for LFE. Otherwise, we are unable to see the
                    basis upon which she could simply leap from $180,000 (the highest sum to date
                    quoted to her for LEC awards) to the sum of $600,000. From the foregoing, it
                    would appear that counsel for the parties, as well as the AR, did not quite
                    appreciate the distinction between LEC and LFE. What was clear was that the
                    parties, as well as the AR, were seeking to work out the appropriate sum to
                    compensate the Appellant for the losses arising from the fact that he can no
                    longer do any real work, apart from the simplest of tasks, in view of the severe
                    impairment of his memory and cognitive abilities. In other words, the
                    Appellant’s capacity to work has effectively been destroyed. While there
                    is no evidence of this, common sense tells us that only a very exceptional
                    employer, prompted perhaps by compassion (such as a charitable institution),
                    will employ someone like the Appellant (who is so mentally impaired) to do the
                    simplest of tasks. While the appeal filed by the Appellant is against the
                    decision of the Judge to reduce the sum of $600,000 awarded by the AR to the sum
                    of $250,000 for what is seemingly LEC, we would regard the present appeal as one
                    seeking to enhance the amount either on the basis of LEC or LFE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Although the Appellant took the position that
                    the award should be for LEC, the proper characterisation of his loss is one for
                    the courts to decide ultimately. There is no injustice to the Respondent because
                    he had in fact argued before the AR and the Judge that an award for LFE (and not
                    LEC) should be made. The Respondent’s position was that the LFE award
                    should not exceed an amount between $150,000 and $180,000 (taking into account a
                    multiplicand of between $300 and $600, a multiplier of between 15 to 18 years,
                    CPF contributions and the award given in <em>Eddie
                        Toon</em> (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>
                        above))<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Distinction between LEC and LFE</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This court, in <em>Samuel
                        Chai</em> (at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above),
                    examined the difference between an award for LFE and that for LEC. Ordinarily,
                    an award for LFE is granted where the plaintiff is in employment at the time of
                    trial, but because of his injuries, is unable to earn as much as what he earned
                    prior to the accident. The difference in earnings would form the basis of the
                    multiplicand. However, if at the time of the trial his earnings are the same as,
                    or even higher than, what he earned before the accident and, if he should lose
                    his current job, he would suffer a disadvantage in getting re-employed due to
                    the injuries sustained, then he would be entitled to claim for LEC, but not for
                    LFE. In <em>Samuel Chai</em>, this court even postulated
                    (at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>) the possibility of a plaintiff, in
                    appropriate circumstances, being awarded both LFE and LEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In a case such as the present which concerns a
                    young person who was still studying when he was injured and whose earning
                    capacity has either been seriously curtailed or destroyed, the traditional
                    manner of awarding LEC or LFE (as described at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) poses a challenge as it is premised on the injured
                    victim being already in employment at the time of the accident. However, the law
                    is dynamic and has developed to meet the demands of justice in particular cases.
                    The fact that the injured person is young and has not commenced work at the time
                    of the accident should not be an impediment to the grant of an award for LFE.
                    The courts have in fact so ruled. In <em>Croke and another v
                        Wiseman and another</em> [1982] 1 WLR 71, the injured victim
                    was only 21 months of age at the time of the accident and seven and a half years
                    old at the time of the trial. The English Court of Appeal adopted a
                    multiplier/multiplicand approach to determine the proper quantum of damages,
                        <em>ie</em>, the award was for LFE. Griffiths LJ stated
                    (at 83D–E):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The judge assessed the future loss of earnings at £5,000 per annum.
                        He arrived at this figure by taking the <em>national average
                            wage</em> for a young man. In my view, he was justified in doing
                        so. This child came from an excellent home, the father is an enterprising
                        man starting his own business and the mother is a qualified teacher; they
                        have shown the quality of their characters by the care they have given their
                        child and their courage by the fact they have continued with their family
                        even after this disaster befell them. The defendants cannot complain that
                        they are unfairly treated if against this background the judge assumes the
                        child will grow up to lead a useful working life and be capable of <em>at least earning the national average wage.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     A similar multiplier/multiplicand approach was
                    also adopted in several other cases, <em>eg</em>, <em>Cassel v Riverside Health Authority</em> [1992] PIQR Q168
                        (“<em>Cassel</em>”) (injured at birth;
                    eight years old at trial) and <em>A (suing by her litigation
                        friend Mrs H) v Powys Local Health Board</em>
                    [2007] EWHC 2996 (injured at birth; 16 years old at trial). In some
                    cases, the English courts took into account the plaintiff’s good family
                    background by increasing the multiplicand beyond the average national wage,
                        <em>eg</em>, <em>Cassel</em>
                    (about two and a half times the average national wage for male non-manual
                    workers) and <em>Almond v Leeds Western Health
                        Authority</em> [1990] 1 Med LR 370 (one and a half times the average
                    national wage).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, it has been suggested that the
                    importance of family background should diminish if the child plaintiff is older
                    at the time of the accident. Goldrein QC and de Haas QC gen eds, <em>Butterworths Personal Injury Litigation Service</em>
                    (LexisNexis, June 2011) states (at [6001]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the child gets older, the process of calculating loss of earnings gets
                        easier. Family background remains relevant, but this diminishes as a picture
                        of the claimant’s own potential can be obtained through his/her
                        academic achievements. It is essential that school reports and test results
                        are obtained along with witness statements from school teachers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This suggestion makes sense because as the child grows older and
                    attends school, his intellectual capacity will show in his school results. Thus,
                    reliance on his school results, rather than family background, would be a more
                    reliable gauge to assess his potential and, in turn, determine what vocation or
                    profession he is likely to embark on, if his earning capacity had not been
                    impaired or destroyed by the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In Singapore, the courts have also, in
                    appropriate cases, awarded LFE to injured plaintiffs who were young at the time
                    of the accident and had yet to commence work at the time of the trial: see,
                        <em>eg</em>, <em>Peh Diana and another v
                        Tan Miang Lee</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 22 and <em>Eddie Toon</em> (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above).
                    As is to be expected, the main difficulty with quantifying LFE in such cases is
                    in determining the multiplicand, as many imponderables come into play.
                    Undeniably, in this exercise, the court is being asked to look into the
                    future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s position</p>

                    He found it difficult to understand what was being taught and had memory
                    problems. Dr Lai concluded that it was uncertain if the Appellant could
                    complete his course because the latter had experienced difficulties dealing with
                    the theoretical and conceptual aspects of art which would be of greater emphasis

                    a painter, he would not be able to work as an art instructor due to his

                    were “reasonably ok”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. She also testified that she had
                    discussed with LaSalle the possibility of “annotating his certificate to
                    indicate that it’s not a real degree or diploma, if he finishes after
                    three years”. This was supported by a letter from LaSalle which stated
                    that “[s]pecial consideration and support were given” to the
                        Appellant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">We observe that these predicted grades may be an underestimate as they
                    are based on the Appellant’s <em>“Promotional”</em> examination results, which were held
                    about ten months before the “<em>Preliminary</em>” examinations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Ms Tan testified that the Appellant took
                    Mathematics for the ‘A’ Level examination as he intended to become
                    an architect and that he was a student who was able to balance his hectic
                    schedule as a key rugby player with his academic studies<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. His junior college art
                    teacher testified that the Appellant was passionate about art and was an
                    expressive artist with well-developed skills<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. We recognise that there is an element
                    of speculation as to whether the Appellant would have, but for the accident,
                    become an architect. But as a matter of probabilities, it would not be without
                    any foundation for this court to hold that in the circumstances, he had more
                    than an even chance of obtaining a university degree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It can be seen (from <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above) that on his own, the Appellant will unlikely be able
                    to obtain his Diploma in Arts from LaSalle. Besides his parents helping him with
                    the theoretical aspects of the course work, the indications are that LaSalle
                    will be awarding him the Diploma in Arts out of sympathy. As his memory and
                    cognitive functions are not likely to get any better, he is not likely to be
                    able to work as a professional art teacher. Of course, as Dr Lai pointed
                    out, it is not necessary to have a diploma in painting to become a successful
                    professional painter. However, it is likely that the Appellant will not be able
                    to do well as a professional painter either, given his severe cognitive and
                    psychological disabilities as well as his being blind in the right eye. The
                    Appellant’s situation is more similar to that in <em>Lai
                        Chi Kay and others v Lee Kuo Shin</em>
                    [1981–1982] SLR(R) 71 at [27], where it was held that the LFE of the plaintiff had
                    clearly crystallised because he, a fourth-year medical student, was no longer
                    able to work as a doctor and it was “highly improbable” that he
                    would ever be gainfully employed. Whereas the plaintiff in <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> was gainfully employed at the time of the
                    hearing, here, given that the Appellant has not been employed and is unlikely
                    ever to be, his earning capacity has been effectively destroyed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We turn next to consider the more difficult
                    question of arriving at an appropriate multiplicand. This court observed in
                        <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> (at [35]) that the court would adopt a particular
                    occupation as the appropriate career model where (a) the plaintiff had indicated
                    a clear intention to enter that particular occupation, (b) there was a strong
                    probability that he would be able to enter that occupation, and (c) that
                    occupation provided a sufficiently certain career model for the estimation of
                    LFE. In this case, unlike the situation in <em>Teo Ai Ling
                        (CA)</em> where the plaintiff there had, at the time of the accident,
                    already embarked on a business course at a polytechnic, the Appellant has not
                    been admitted into an architectural school. It may therefore be too speculative
                    to hold that he would likely have qualified as an architect but for the
                    accident. Nonetheless, it seems to us fair, and not too optimistic, to hold that
                    he was likely to obtain a university degree, and accordingly, to determine the
                    multiplicand on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     According to the Ministry of Manpower Report
                    on Wages in Singapore 2009, the median monthly gross starting salary for
                    university graduates was $2,700. In <em>Teo Ai Ling
                        (CA)</em>, this court took into account the <em>maximum</em> salary which a polytechnic diploma holder could earn on
                    the civil service scale. In the present case, there is no evidence at all which
                    would enable this court to come to a conclusion as to the average or median
                    earnings of a university graduate, say, over a period of 20 years. Indeed,
                    recognising the innumerable pursuits which a university graduate could undertake
                    and their varying successes, we do not think there will likely be any useful
                    statistics. Of course, the pay scales applicable in the civil service (being the
                    biggest employer in the country) to a university graduate could be of some
                    assistance. But this evidence is not before the court. In the circumstances, we
                    are left with only $2,700 as the national median starting pay of a university
                    graduate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The next consideration which we must take into
                    account is the likely income that the Appellant will, after the accident, be
                    able to earn from any pursuit which he may embark in the future. We have held
                    (at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) that in view of the
                    Appellant’s disabilities, he is unlikely to be able to obtain any
                    employment. We further explored (at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>
                    above) the possibility of the Appellant being employed as a professional artist
                    or painter and here again, we do not think the prospects are that bright. Even
                    if we take an optimistic view of the situation and say that the Appellant will
                    be able to sell his works and earn some income, the figure which we can
                    attribute to this pursuit will be highly speculative, to say the least. In any
                    event, the multiplicand which we should adopt is really $2,700, plus an
                    additional amount (“$x”) representing the sum which should be
                    added to ensure that the total multiplicand will represent the average salary of
                    a university graduate over a period of years (and not just the median <em>starting</em> salary). On the evidence before us, what this
                    additional $x sum should be cannot reasonably be ascertained. The same can be
                    said about the income which the Appellant will likely earn, after the accident,
                    as an artist or painter. For these reasons, we think, in the circumstances, that
                    the fairest approach will be to offset these two factors, leaving us to take
                    $2,700 as the reasonable multiplicand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Finally, there remains the question of the
                    appropriate multiplier. In <em>Teo Ai Ling (HC)</em>, the
                    multiplier used by the High Court was 20 years for a 23-year old female
                    polytechnic student at the time of the hearing. However, as we have indicated
                    (at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above), in <em>Teo
                        Ai Ling (CA)</em>, this court substituted the High Court’s award
                    for LFE with a provisional LEC award without disapproving the multiplier adopted
                    by the High Court in that case. In the present case, the Appellant was 22 years
                    old at the time of the hearing before the AR. A multiplier of 20 years does not
                    seem to be inappropriate in this appeal given that the Appellant here was (at
                    the time of assessment before the AR) of nearly the same age as the plaintiff in
                        <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em>. Therefore, the total award
                    for LFE should be $2,700 x 12 months x 20 years = $648,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Future psychiatric treatment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     We will now turn to consider the third
                    disputed head of claim. The Judge noted that although the Appellant claimed only
                    $121,200 (at $505 per month for 20 years), the AR awarded him $144,000 (at $600
                    per month for 20 years). The Judge accepted Dr Wang’s testimony that
                    there was a 70% to 80% probability that the Appellant would require long-term
                    medication for five to ten years and that if after that period the
                    Appellant’s condition remained unchanged, he would require the medication
                    for life. The Judge, however, noted that Dr Wang did not state the cost of
                    the treatment, and that the Respondent had calculated, based on charges incurred
                    by the Appellant in 2008 and 2009, that the cost of treatment amounted to about
                    $350 to $400 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the other hand, the Judge did not accept
                    the Respondent’s argument that the award of expenses should be reduced
                    because, if the Appellant were to receive treatment at a government-structured
                    hospital instead of a private specialist, the expenses could be less than $350
                    to $400 a month. In this regard, the Judge held that (Judgment at [42]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It is for the injured party to decide on the treatment that he is to
                        receive, and he is entitled to claim <em>reasonable</em> costs of treatment. He is not obliged to seek
                        treatment or receive damages at the lowest costs available. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the Judge allowed the Respondent’s appeal by reducing the
                    amount awarded under this head from $144,000 to $90,000 (at $375 per month for
                    20 years).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In considering this head of damage, we need to

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     between 14 October 2008 and
                        9 December 2008, 2 mg of “Risperdal” per day;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     between
                        9 December 2008 and 31 January 2009, 5 mg of “Zydis”
                        per day and 20 mg of “Magrilan” per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Dr Wang stopped prescribing
                    “Risperdal” because the Appellant was not responding well to it.
                    Although the new combination of “Zydis” and
                    “Magrilan” had in fact worked well, Dr Wang switched the
                    medication again because the Appellant complained of drowsiness and grogginess.
                    Dr Wang then prescribed 10 mg of “Abilify” per day and 20 mg
                    of “Magrilan” per day between 31 January 2009 and 4 July
                    2009. Based on the invoices from Dr Wang, the average monthly costs of the
                    different courses of medication were as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The total cost of consultation between 9 December 2008 and
                    4 July 2009 was $1,260, which works out to be about $180 per
                month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Respondent made the following arguments in
                    support of his contention that the amount of $144,000 awarded by the AR under
                    this head is not justified. First, the Appellant in fact claimed only for
                    $121,200 as the cost of future treatment and $9,600 for transport to and from
                    the hospital, making a total of $130,800. Secondly, the AR did not explain the
                    basis upon which she adopted the multiplicand of $600 in calculating this head
                    of damage and the Appellant’s contention that the multiplicand of $600 was
                    based on the later invoices tendered cannot be substantiated. The following was
                    all that the AR explained in relation to this point:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I accept the evidence of Dr Wang that the patient’s organic
                        brain syndrome may lead to certain psychoses which will require medical
                        attention, and that there is a 70-80% chance that he will require long term
                        medication and/or psychiatric attention. In this regard, I am making an
                        award of $600 per month for psychiatric consultation and medication, where
                        this is required. Based on a multiplier of 20 years, this works out to
                        $144,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Thirdly, the Respondent argued that the award
                    for future psychiatric expenses should be based not on more recent invoices for
                    medicine which was more effective and had less side-effects, but on the invoices
                    for the whole course of medication that had been prescribed regardless of the
                    side-effects of any particular cocktail of medicines. On this basis, the
                    Respondent argues that the Judge was right to adopt the figure of $350 to $400
                    per month, which was the average cost of medication prescribed for the Appellant
                    between 14 October 2008 and 4 July 2009. In the absence of any
                    evidence from Dr Wang as to a fair estimate of the cost of future
                    treatment, the only reliable source of evidence would be to look at past
                    invoices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the other hand, the Appellant argues that
                    the calculation advanced by the Respondent should not be accepted because it was
                    based partly on medication that was discontinued by Dr Wang as being not
                    effective or as a result of side-effects. The assessment should be based on the
                    cost of medication which is best suited to the Appellant, meaning the last set
                    of medication prescribed by Dr Wang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We are unable to accept the arguments advanced
                    by the Respondent for the simple reason that it would be wrong to make an award
                    for future psychiatric treatment based on the cost of medication which has been
                    found to be unsuitable to address the ailment and was therefore discontinued. It
                    stands to reason that the court should only adopt the cost of medication which
                    is regarded as being reasonably effective in remedying the ailment with minimal
                    side effects. We have (at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above) stated
                    the reason why Dr Wang switched medication from the combination of
                    “Zydis” and “Magrilan” (“the first
                    combination”) to that of “Abilify” and
                    “Magrilan” (“the second combination”). While we note
                    Dr Wang’s evidence that both combinations were of equivalent
                        effectiveness<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, we
                    cannot disregard the fact that the first combination of medicine caused the
                    Appellant drowsiness or grogginess, whereas the second combination did not. This
                    at least indicates that the second combination is more suitable for the
                    Appellant. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to adopt the cost of the second
                    combination to work out the future cost of psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Besides the cost of the second combination of
                    medicine (which is $402 per month and which we will round down to $400), there
                    is the additional cost of consultation. The average cost of consultation between
                    9 December 2008 and 4 July 2009 was $180 per month. The cost of
                    consultation would naturally vary according to the frequency and length of each
                    visit to the psychiatrist. Arguably, one may visit the psychiatrist only once a
                    year in order to obtain a year’s supply of medication. However, this would
                    clearly not be prudent in light of the fact that psychiatric medication often
                    consists of drugs with a powerful effect on the central nervous system, and that
                    therefore, the use of such drugs should be monitored periodically. The fee
                    charged by Dr Wang for a short consultation was $90 per visit. However, it
                    is also true that over time, the need for consultation will be reduced.
                    Provision for one consultation per month would be adequate. The Appellant also
                    claimed transport cost of $40 per month, seemingly based on two consultations
                    per month. One consultation per month will require half that amount. Thus the
                    cost of consultation and transport will add up to $110 per month. Adding this to
                    the cost of medicine at $400, we arrive at the figure of $510 per
                month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Thus, the appropriate multiplicand here is
                    $510 per month. Both the AR and the Judge used a multiplier of 20 years. As the
                    Appellant was 22 years old at the time of the assessment, this means that he
                    will be 42 years old when the amount awarded for future psychiatric costs is, in
                    theory, depleted. In this regard, we note that in <em>Ang Leng
                        Hock v Leo Ee Ah</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 361, the High Court
                    held (at [59]) that an award of future
                    medical costs, unlike LFE, should be based on life expectancy rather than the
                    retirement age. We agree. In <em>De Cruz Andrea Heidi v Guangzhou
                        Yuzhitang Health Products Co Ltd and others</em> [2003]
                    4 SLR(R) 682, the High Court held (at [211]) that taking into account
                    the vicissitudes of life, a fair multiplier would be two-thirds of the expected
                    remaining 51 years of life (the 51 years was based on the average life
                    expectancy of 80 years for females in Singapore). In the present case, there was
                    no evidence before the court as to the average life expectancy of males in
                    Singapore. Assuming that the Appellant is expected to live until 75 years of
                    age, he would have had approximately 53 remaining years of life as at the time
                    of the assessment. Two-thirds of this would be approximately 36 years. Given
                    that Dr Wang testified that there was a possibility that life-long
                    psychiatric treatment might <em>not</em> be needed (see
                        <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above) and the fact that the entire
                    sum for <em>future</em> psychiatric treatment will be paid
                    upfront as a lump sum, the multiplier of 20 years adopted by the AR and the
                    Judge (which was not challenged by both parties) does not seem unreasonable.
                    Thus, the total award for this head of claim is $510 x 12 months x 20 years =
                    $122,400.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Loss of income of the Appellant’s mother</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It is well-established that this head of
                    damage is recoverable not because it is the mother’s loss, but because it
                    is <em>the Appellant’s loss</em>, being the
                    reasonable cost of meeting the need created by the tort: see <em>Donnelly v Joyce</em> [1974] 1 QB 454 (“<em>Donnelly</em>”) and <em>Kuan
                        </em><em>Kian Seng v Wong Choon Keh</em>
                    [1995] SGHC 43. As Megaw LJ stated in <em>Donnelly</em> (at 461H–462C):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We do not agree with the proposition ... that the plaintiff’s claim,
                        in circumstances such as the present, is properly to be regarded as being
                        ... “in relation to someone else’s loss,” merely because
                        someone else has provided to, or for the benefit of, the plaintiff—the
                        injured person—the money, or the services to be valued as money, to
                        provide for needs of the plaintiff directly caused by the defendant’s
                        wrongdoing. The loss <em>is</em> the plaintiff’s
                        loss. ... The plaintiff’s loss, to take this present case, is not the
                        expenditure of money to buy the special boots or to pay for the nursing
                        attention. His loss is the existence of the need for those special boots or
                        for those nursing services, the value of which for purposes of
                        damages—for the purpose of the ascertainment of the amount of his
                        loss—is the proper and reasonable cost of supplying those needs. That,
                        in our judgment, is the key to the problem. So far as the defendant is
                        concerned, the loss is not someone else’s loss. It is the
                        plaintiff’s loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pre-trial loss of income</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We will now consider the final head of
                    dispute. The basis upon which the AR made this award of $72,600 was explained in
                    these terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I accept the evidence of the parents that [the Appellant] required full
                        time care at home after the accident. As a result, she [<em>ie</em>, the mother] had to give up her part-time employment as a
                        teacher. I will therefore allow the claim for $72,600, for the period 2005
                        – 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Two letters were produced in support of this claim<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. The first letter
                    was sent on 31 December 2004 by the principal of Yuhua Education Centre
                    (“the Centre”), a PAP Community Foundation kindergarten, to the
                    Appellant’s mother, stating that her part-time employment had been
                    converted to full-time employment from 1 January 2005 and that her monthly
                    salary was to be increased from $550 to $1000. This letter was sent to the
                    mother two days before the accident occurred on 2 January 2005. The second
                    letter was sent on 4 May 2009 by the principal of the Centre. It stated
                    that the mother resigned in June 2005 after taking six months of <em>unpaid</em> leave to look after the Appellant. The principal
                    of the Centre went on to state that the mother had been using the Centre’s
                    facilities to conduct tuition classes in the evening since January
                1994.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In RA 440/2009, the Respondent appealed
                    against this award. The Judge allowed the appeal and set aside the award because
                    he felt it was quantified “without an explanation or documentation on how
                    that figure was arrived at” (Judgment at [47]). The Judge found that there was no evidence to support
                    this claim because the two letters were not properly proved in
                evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Appellant concedes that the two letters
                    were not properly admitted into evidence for the purpose of proving the truth of
                    their contents because the letters were just exhibits in the Appellant’s
                    father’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) and the
                    father was neither the writer nor the recipient of the letters. The Appellant
                    argues, however, that both parties had agreed to the admission of the letters at
                    the hearing before the AR. This argument is unfounded. As the Respondent points
                    out, there was no agreement to admit the contents of the letters. In his closing
                    submissions before the AR, the Respondent had clearly objected to the letters on
                    the ground that they were hearsay evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     However, the Appellant contends that even if
                    the letters were not properly admitted in evidence, there was, in any case,
                    sufficient evidence before the AR upon which the award could have been made.
                    First, the Appellant’s mother gave evidence in her AEIC that she had in
                    fact resigned from her job to look after the Appellant. Secondly, the
                    Appellant’s father testified that the mother, <em>ie</em>, his spouse with whom he was living, had in fact done so.
                    These statements are not hearsay evidence but are direct evidence that the
                    Appellant’s mother did, in fact, give up her full-time job to care for
                    him. There is no good reason why such evidence of the Appellant’s parents
                    should not be accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The next issue relates to the remuneration
                    which the Appellant’s mother had received from the job that she gave up.
                    The Respondent argues that the mother’s evidence, that she was earning
                    $550 per month as a part-time teacher before the accident, was self-serving and
                    was uncorroborated by any documentary evidence. However, this argument goes to
                    the weight of the evidence and will depend considerably on the finder of
                    fact’s impression of the witness and her behaviour on the stand. As the AR
                    evidently believed the evidence of the Appellant’s parents (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above), there is no reason to disturb this
                    finding in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary. Moreover, being
                    paid $550 a month for a part-time job as a teacher in a kindergarten in 2004 can
                    hardly be viewed as extravagant. This remuneration does not appear to be
                    unreasonable. The Respondent is unable to provide any plausible reason, other
                    than a bare assertion, that the mother’s evidence is self-serving and
                    should not be accepted. It bears noting that the mother’s evidence was not
                    challenged during cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     A second ground advanced by the Respondent on
                    this head of claim rests on the fact that the AR had already allowed an award
                    for the engagement of a maid (which was affirmed by the Judge) and there was no
                    evidence that two full-time caregivers were needed to care for the Appellant.
                    Here, we note that the Appellant’s mother testified that a maid was needed
                    first, to help in the Appellant’s physiotherapy and to move the Appellant
                    around, and secondly, to help with the housework because she (<em>ie</em>, the mother) was preoccupied with taking care of the
                        Appellant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. This evidence was not challenged
                    during cross-examination. Again, we cannot see any basis to interfere in this
                    finding of the AR when there was evidence before the AR which supported
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Therefore, there was evidence before the AR
                    which could have supported an award for pre-trial loss of income. With respect,
                    we think the Judge erred in stating that the award was made without factual
                    basis. However, there is one aspect of the Respondent’s argument on this
                    award which, in our view, merits consideration. This relates to the quantum.
                    First, the mother did not suffer a complete loss of income because she still
                    managed to give tuition at night, making an average of $1,000 a
                        month<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. Before
                    the accident, she taught at the Centre in the morning only. The housework and
                    grocery shopping would be done in the afternoon while she would give tuition at
                        night<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. If the mother were to commence full-time
                    teaching at the Centre, it would not be unlikely that she would have to either
                    give up some of the tuition classes at night in order to do the housework, or
                    hire a maid to do the housework. This would mean that any additional income she
                    would have earned as a full-time teacher would essentially be negated (or
                    reduced substantially) by either losing part of the tuition income (through a
                    reduction in tuition hours) or having to pay for a maid to do the
                    housework.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Secondly, the award of $72,600 made by the AR
                    in respect of the four-year period (from 2005 to 2008) amounted to approximately
                    $1,500 per month. This figure cannot be supported from the evidence. The
                    Appellant’s father admitted that the mother had been earning about $1,000
                    a month from giving tuition at night before the accident, and that these classes
                    continued after the accident. In other words, there was no reduction in tuition
                    income after the accident. As for her salary at the Centre, if the accident had
                    not occurred, she would have earned $1,000 per month as a full-time teacher.
                    Although the two letters from the principal of the Centre were not properly
                    adduced in evidence, both parents testified that this was the truth. We would
                    also observe that earning $1,000 per month as a full-time kindergarten teacher
                    is hardly excessive. However, as we have explained (at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> above), the mother would have needed some domestic help if
                    she were to take on the full-time job in the Centre. Thus, for the mother to
                    earn $2000 per month, she would have to incur expenses to engage domestic help.
                    Alternatively, she would have to cut down on the tuition classes and earn less.
                    In either event, her net monthly income would have been less than $2000. Bearing
                    in mind that post-accident the mother was still earning $1000 a month from
                    giving tuition, and for the reasons alluded to in this paragraph and above (at
                        <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>), it would not be unreasonable to
                    assume that her actual loss was somewhere around $550 a month (<em>ie</em>, what the mother earned as a part-time teacher) and
                    not $1000 a month. In the result, the loss of income of the mother for the four
                    year period would have been only $26,400 (<em>ie</em>, $550
                    x 12 months x 4 years). Thus, the AR’s award of $76,200 is manifestly
                    excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the result, we hold that the Judge’s
                    decision on this head of damage should be set aside. The AR’s award should
                    be reinstated, but with the quantum reduced to $26,400.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Future loss of income</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The AR rejected the Appellant’s claim
                    for $251,802 as the mother’s future loss of income: the claim was computed
                    at about $1,650 per month for 13 years (until the mother was 62 years old). We
                    should, at this juncture, reiterate that (see <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above) the rationale for this claim is not so much for the
                    Respondent to pay compensation to the mother as such, who has suffered no
                    injury, but rather to compensate the Appellant for the cost of having someone
                    take care of him in the future, which role the mother is fulfilling. The
                    mother’s loss of income, which she would otherwise have earned, is taken
                    as the starting point to compute the reasonable expense which the Appellant
                    would have to incur to obtain such care. The Appellant in RA 445/2009 appealed
                    against the AR’s refusal to make an award for this head of claim. This
                    appeal was rejected by the Judge on the basis of lack of evidence as the two
                    letters from the principal of the Centre (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above) constituted hearsay evidence. In the Notice of
                    Appeal filed against the Judge’s decision, the Appellant appealed against
                    that part of the Judge’s decision that decided that:</p>

                            totaling $12,000.00 plus disbursements.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     What was set aside by the Judge was the
                    mother’s <em>pre-trial</em> loss of income. As
                    regards the mother’s loss of future income, the Judge upheld the
                    AR’s decision not to make any award on that. It would appear from the
                    Appellant’s Case (at para 148) that the Appellant was under the
                    mistaken impression that the Judge had also set aside the claim for the
                    mother’s loss of future income of $251,802. Therefore, there may be a
                    question mark as to whether the claim for the mother’s loss of future
                    income is under appeal. However, when we examine the Appellant’s Case, we
                    hardly see any submissions on this aspect of the claim. This is evident from the
                    following extract of the Appellant’s Case (at paras 150 to
                    152):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">150. We respectfully submit that the order for the mother’s pre
                        trial loss of income should be allowed because the Learned Registrar was in
                        a position to assess the evidence of the mother and the witnesses and
                        experts who testified that the mother was Wei Kong’s primary care
                        giver.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">151. Additionally, as he is not fit to manage his estate or his affairs,
                        the mother would have to continue to be his primary care giver and should be
                        compensated for the loss she <em>had</em> suffered on
                        account of the accident that her son was involved in.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">152. The Learned AR’s computation of pre trial loss of income is
                        almost equivalent to the income she would have earned for six months at
                        $1,000.00 a month. ($1,000 X 12 X 6 = $72,000). Taking into account that Wei
                        Kong was in hospital for more than 5 months and there is evidence that he
                        had to be rehabilitated at home with the mother’s close involvement,
                        the award made for pre trial loss of income is fair and should stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the Appellant is cognitively and psychologically impaired, he
                    is now physically mobile and is able to perform basic domestic functions. He is
                    not likely to require constant care by the mother. In the circumstances, we will
                    not make any award on this item of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For the above reasons, we will allow the
                    appeal in respect of the following heads of claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     the award by the Judge for loss of
                        earning capacity at $250,000 is substituted by an award for loss of future
                        earnings at $648,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     the award by the Judge for future psychiatric treatment is enhanced
                        from $90,000 to $122,400; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_c"></a>(c)     there shall be an award for the Appellant’s
                        mother’s pre-trial loss of income assessed at
                    $26,400.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In view of the fact that the Appellant has
                    substantially succeeded in this appeal, the Appellant shall have two-third of
                    the costs for this appeal as well as for the hearing before the Judge. There
                    will be the usual consequential orders.</p>
