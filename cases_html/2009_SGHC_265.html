<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The two charges arose in the same transaction. Eight blocks of vegetable material wrapped in aluminium foil were recovered from the accused’s car when he was arrested. When the eight blocks were analysed, they were found to contain cannabis and cannabis mixture. This gave rise to two charges because cannabis and cannabis mixture are treated as distinct drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) had kept the accused on surveillance on the date of his arrest on 13 July 2006. He was observed to have driven his car SBR 4484 (“the car”) into the compound of Sri Arasakesari Sivan Temple (“the temple”) along Sungei Kadut Avenue at about 5.15 pm. The accused parked the car and went out of it. He then met up with another man, Sundar Arujunan (“Sundar”) in the compound. Sundar was carrying a red and blue bag (“the bag”). Sundar placed the bag into the back seat of the car. The accused and Sundar then went into the car, with the accused driving and Sundar in the front passenger’s seat. He drove the car out of the temple compound and proceeded to Woodlands Road where Sundar alighted, leaving the bag in the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The CNB officers continued to keep surveillance on the accused’s car. They trailed the car as it made its way to Kranji Expressway, Sungei Tengah Road, Bricklands Road, KJE, Pioneer Road North, Jurong West Streets 91, 92 and 93, Upper Jurong Road, Pioneer Road North, Pioneer Circle and Pioneer Road where the journey ended with the arrest of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The route taken by the accused showed that he was driving around in no particular direction. The officers noted in their pocket books after the arrest that the accused was driving at a high speed, that he drove through two red traffic lights and made two turns around Pioneer Circle<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns="">The accused’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After his arrest, several statements which were recorded from the accused by different officers were admitted into evidence without objection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first statement was recorded by Senior Staff Sgt David Ng (“SSSgt Ng”) at about 6.20 pm on the day of the arrest, after the accused, the car and the bag were taken from the scene of arrest to a trailer park along Jurong Road. This statement was recorded with another officer, Sgt Chelliah Vijay, acting as Tamil interpreter.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rajoo rang me at around two something to three and told me to come to Sivan Temple at Sungei Kadut Road to meet him at 3.30pm. At about 3.30 pm, I went to the temple and no one was around. The gate was closed. He called me again and told me to go to a food centre nearby and asked me to wait there. I parked my car near the food centre and went inside the food centre. I viewed the food stalls and then went to the toilet. I was in the toilet for about 7 minutes and then I came out. Ah Bang, who was a truck driver I knew previously, came into the toilet and confronted me. Ah Bang asked me whether the book had arrived. I did not know what is the book he referred but whenever Rajoo brought in something, they would refer to as book. I told Ah Bang the book had not arrived. He then gave me $4000 and asked me to pass to Rajoo. I called Rajoo later and I went to a coffeeshop later at Choa Chu Kang. Rajoo rang me up on my phone and asked me to meet at the temple. At 5 something, I arrived at the temple. The gate was opened and I parked my car inside. Rajoo arrived then. He was carrying a bag. Rajoo asked me to open up the boot but I had other things in the boot, so he opened up the rear passenger door to put the bag on the seat. Rajoo came and sat in the car. He told me to drive off. While driving along Bukit Timah Road towards city, suddenly Rajoo asked me to stop the car. He dropped off and told me either Ah Bang or himself would call me later. I then drove off. Police arrested me later in the car. They asked me what was in the bag and I told them I don’t know. I did not commit the offence. I helped them because I am obligated to them. They used me because I am a soft man. I will fully cooperate and tell all the truth.</p>

He did not tell me specifically what I was needed to do, just that I was to transport something for him. He further told me that it would not involve any heavy drugs or explosives. My understanding then of heavy drugs was cocaine or heroin.</p>
<p class="judg-quote-1">20    I agreed to help ‘Kumar’ then. In return, I did not expect any reward from him. ‘Kumar’ and ‘Anand’ did treat me to girls and drinks before, and because of that, I felt obligated to help them. I also made it clear to them that I would help only if I could as I was busy with my own work. The meeting ended then. ‘Kumar’ did not tell me exactly when he needed my help.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    In around June 2006, I started helping ‘Kumar’ and ‘Anand’ to do the transportation. ‘Kumar’ had instructed me to park my car at the carpark of a Sivan temple at Sungei Kadut (Recorder’s note: Accused was referring to Sri Arasakesari Temple located at 25 Sungei Kadut Avenue). I was not to lock my car. Someone would come and drop something in my car. Later, I was to transport the thing to a canteen along Sungei Kadut, which was about 7 minutes drive from the temple. I could not remember the exact address of the place. I would then park my car along the main road of the canteen and go for coffee in the canteen. I was to wait until the thing was collected before I could drive off. ‘Kumar’ also told me not to worry and everything would be alright.</p>

<td valign="top" width="95%">
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    Although ‘Kumar’ gave me the instructions for the job, he did not tell me when exactly to do it for him. Altogether, I helped ‘Kumar’ twice. The second time being the one whereby I was arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    I could not remember exactly when was the first time I helped ‘Kumar’. It should be sometime in June, July 2006. ‘Kumar’ called me on my Singapore handphone. ‘Kumar’s’ handphone number did not appear in my handphone then and the display on my phone showed “unknown”. ‘Kumar’ instructed me to go to the temple and I immediately knew then that he wanted me to help him transport something. ‘Kumar’ probably told me what time to go down but I could not remember. I told him that I would go down only if I was free. I also told ‘Kumar’ that I was doing this as a favour for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    At around evening time, I drove down to the temple (Recorder’s note: Accused was referring to Sri Arasakesari Temple located at 25 Sungei Kadut Avenue) and parked my car inside the carpark of the temple. I alighted from my car, washed my feet, and went into the temple to pray. I did not lock my car then. During this period, I did not receive anymore calls from ‘Kumar’ or ‘Anand’. I prayed in the temple for about 20 minutes and came out to find a blue or green haversack left on the left rear passenger’s seat. I did not touch the haversack or open it up. I also could not remember if the haversack was locked, but I did not consider checking the content of the haversack as I did not want to know or have anything to do with it. I did not know what was in the haversack, but I thought they may be testing me by asking me to deliver it. I did not suspect then that it might contain drugs then.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    I wished to add that the arrangement with ‘Kumar’ was that he would tell the other parties my car number and they would then put the thing or take the thing from my car accordingly. I was not to lock my car in order to facilitate these events.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    I then drove down to a canteen along Sungei Kadut and parked my car along the main road. I went inside the canteen and had noodles and coffee. I was seated in a position where I was blocked by the MRT track pillars and could not see my car. I was in the canteen for about 15 to 20 minutes and during this time, I did not see anybody going to my car. When I left the canteen and went to my car, I found that the haversack was gone. I then drove off. About half an hour later, while I was driving, I received a call from ‘Kumar’ and he told me that everything was okay. I knew then that he meant the haversack had been collected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    For this occasion, I did not see anybody who left or collect the haversack from my car. After this incident, sometime later, ‘Kumar’ called me and asked me to come down to Johor Bahru, but I told him that I was not free and I did not meet up with him.</p>

<td valign="top" width="95%">
<p class="judg-quote-1">29    On 13/07/06, in the afternoon, at about 2pm, ‘Kumar’ rang me up and told me to be at the temple at 3.30pm. I again knew that he wanted me to help him transport something. I was at a scrap yard in Sungei Kadut when ‘Kumar’ called, as I had wanted to buy a filter cover for a compressor. I searched around for the filter cover at 2 to 3 scrap yards until around 3.30pm, when I drove to the temple. Upon reaching the temple, I found that the gate was closed. Just about then, I received another call from an unknown person who told me to go to the canteen to have a drink and wait for a while. He said he would arrive in about 15 to 20 minutes. I did not know the caller but he did not sound like ‘Kumar’. The display on my handphone showed “unknown” for this call.</p>
<p class="judg-quote-1">30    I arrived at the canteen at about 3.45pm. I parked my car at the same spot near the MRT track pillar, along the main road in front of the canteen. I viewed the food stalls in the canteen and then went to the toilet. I went into the cubicle for about 5 to 7 minutes and then came out to wash my hand. While I was washing my hand, a male Indian approached me in the toilet. I wish to say that I could not recognize him. He addressed me ‘Abang’ (Recorder’s note: ‘Abang’ is a term for elder brother) and asked me if the “books” had not arrived. As a common greeting, I also called him ‘Abang’, even though I did not recognize him, and told him “no”, implying that the “books” had not arrived.</p>
<p class="judg-quote-1">31    I wished to add that this was the first time I heard of the term “books” and I believed that it was a code but I did not know what it referred to. I believed that ‘Abang’ might have been waiting around and saw me arriving in my car. He had probably gone to my car then and saw that there was nothing inside. So he came to me and asked me about the “books”.</p>
<p class="judg-quote-1">32    ‘Abang’ then gave me a stack of folded money. He did not tell me how much it was but he told me that it was workman’s money and I was to give it to whoever that comes. By that, I understood that I was to give the money to the person who would be giving me the “books”. After this, ‘Abang’ left. I went back to the cubicle again and counted the money. I counted a total of about S$4000. I then kept the money in my right pants’ pocket and left the toilet. I counted the money because I was afraid that they might accuse me of taking the money.</p>
<p class="judg-quote-1">33    ‘Abang’ is a male Indian about 39 years old. He is about 5 feet 5 inches tall. He is slim with a dark normal length hair which was not properly combed. He has a straight face. I did not notice any tattoos or if he wears glasses. He was in a white and blue t-shirt.</p>

While I was driving, I received a call from an unknown person. I did not know who the caller was. It could have been the same unknown caller who called me earlier or the ‘Abang’ whom I met in the toilet of the canteen. This unknown caller told me to wait for another 15 minutes, as he was on the way. I did not want to go to the temple then and I would have just gone back to my workplace if not for the money which ‘Abang’ had given me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    I am now shown my handphone and a phone record for “Answered” phone call. I wished to say that when I received the phone call, I saved the number under ‘Tabi’ (Recorder’s note: Accused was shown his handphone, and the record made on 13/07/06 at 5.22pm belonging to one ‘Tabi’. The phone number of ‘Tabi’ is 93972437). I saved the number randomly under the name ‘Tabi’ with the intention to call him later. In the event that I arrived at the temple and ‘Tabi’ was not present, I would then call him and tell him that I would not be waiting anymore and would be going back to work. I did not know who ‘Tabi’ was then.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    As I was already in the vicinity of Choa Chu Kang when I received the call, I decided to have a coffee at a coffeeshop. After about 10 minutes, I left the coffeeshop and drove towards the temple. I arrived at the temple between 5pm and 6pm. The gate was opened and I drove into the temple compound and parked my car in the carpark. I alighted from the car and as I was about to go into the temple, I saw a male Indian approaching my car. I roughly have an idea of who he was. I remembered his name as ‘Rajoo’, or ‘Abang’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    I believed I had seen ‘Rajoo’ before in Malaysia with ‘Kumar’ and ‘Anand’. However, I could not remember when or in what situation I met him. I could remember his name as ‘Rajoo’ because during one of the drinking sessions with ‘Kumar’, he told me that somebody would come and bring something which he did not specify then. But he mentioned that this somebody could be ‘Rajoo’, ‘Anand’ or someone else. This is why I remembered the name ‘Rajoo’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    While ‘Rajoo’ was approaching my car, I saw him carrying a bag across his shoulder. From the way he carried the bag, I could see that it was heavy. I am now shown a photo of a bag and I recognized it to be the bag that ‘Rajoo’ was carrying (Recorder’s note: Accused was shown the photo with exhibit marked “A”. He confirmed that this was the said bag by appending his signature on the photo). ‘Rajoo’ came nearer to my car, approaching the passenger side. I also went to the driver side of the car. He asked me whether he should leave the bag in the boot, but I told him to leave it in the backseat instead. As the car was not locked, he opened the rear left passenger’s door and placed the bag on the left passenger’s seat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    While ‘Rajoo’ was putting the bag down, I boarded my car as well. I then told ‘Rajoo’ to come into the front passenger seat so that I could pass him the S$4000. As I did not want to stay in the temple compound, I started the car and drove off. I was going in the direction towards my workplace in Jurong. While driving, I took out the money from my right pants pocket and gave to ‘Rajoo’. I could not remember if he counted the money then, but I told him that it was workman’s money. ‘Rajoo’ then asked me where I was going and I told him that I was going to my workplace. Suddenly, he told me to stop the car, which was just before the bus stop, along Bukit Timah Road, in the direction towards the city. ‘Rajoo’ then alighted from the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    I drove off and headed for Jurong with the intention to go to my workplace then. Afterwhich I would wait for ‘Abang’ to call me and arrange for a meeting place to pick up the bag. During this entire time, I did not touch the bag at all. I did not notice whether the bag was locked but I had no intention to see the content inside. I did not want to check the bag as I thought it was better not for me to see. I suspected that something was not right, and the bag might contain something illegal. I had this suspicion because if the content was legal, they would not need to be so discreet. Only then I realized that they were using me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    While travelling, I could not remember the exact time then, I came to a stop at a traffic light along Pioneer Road, at the Esso Refinery and Petrol Kiosk. 3 cars then came by. 1 car stopping in front of my car, 1 behind my car and 1 at the passenger’s side. I saw several men in plain clothes coming out of the car. They smashed my windscreen and the side windows. They brought me out of the car and made me sit on the road. Afterwhich, they then handcuffed me. I did not struggle during the arrest.</p>

However, the word ‘glass’ was read over in English and not translated to me in Tamil. So I thought that the officer said ‘glass’ and I did not correct them. On 20/07/2006 when the same statement was read over to me, I did mention to the Tamil interpreter that I said ‘glass’ instead of ‘grass’ but he did not clarify with the recorder.

<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns="">The evidence of Sundar</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The prosecutor wanted to rely on Sundar’s evidence to show that the accused knew what was in the bag. Sundar was a friend of the accused whom he called Ravi, and the accused knew him as Rajoo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Sundar was arrested by CNB officers after he parted company with the accused. After his arrest, he was charged with two charges of trafficking in cannabis and cannabis mixture in the bag (both quantified at just below the threshold levels at which the death penalty applies). He pleaded guilty to both charges and had been sentenced to concurrent sentences of twenty years imprisonment by the time he became a witness in the accused’s trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Statements were taken from him before and after his conviction. His evidence covered many areas, including common friend he had with the accused by the name “Sasi”, an occasion prior to 13 July 2006 when he had handed a bag to the accused. However, it was his evidence on the accused’s knowledge of the contents of the bag he brought to the car on 13 July 2006 that was most important to the trial of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The prosecutor questioned Sundar on the exchange he had with the accused in the latter’s car after they left the temple and before he got off the car. The use of the term <em>kanja payal</em> (spelt with some variations in the trial transcripts), which means “miser” in Tamil came up for reasons that will be discussed later. Sundar’s evidence was that the accused had called him a <em>kanja payal</em>. According to Sundar this happened when the accused offered to buy Sundar a meal, and when he did not accept the offer, the accused asked Sundar to buy him a meal instead, but Sundar said that he did not have the money for that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_20"></a>20     During cross-examination Sundar agreed with the prosecutor that:</p>

Sundar confirmed that he was truthful when he made four statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He was asked if the statements would help him recall the conversation he had with the accused in the car on 13 July 2006. When Sundar replied that the statements would help him remember,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Sundar was referred to two of his statements of 17 July 2006 and 20 July 2006, particularly to paras 37 and 52 of the respective statements in accordance to s 161 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97 Rev Ed 1997) (“Evidence Act”).

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The prosecutor then took steps to prove that Sundar had given inconsistent accounts of the conversation in his statements. He began by applying for leave under s 156 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine Sundar and when leave was granted, he proceeded to impeach Sundar’s credit on four statements Sundar made on 16, 17, 18 and 20 July 2006 and the statement of facts he admitted to when he pleaded guilty to the two charges against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The prosecutor’s intention was to show that there was a conversation between the accused and Sundar in the car about the contents of the bag.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_34"></a>34     He had only primary school education, but by his efforts he became engaged in business in marine construction and piling in Malaysia and also managed a pub in Singapore. In the course of his work, he dealt with labour suppliers in Malaysia, including two named Anand and Kumar. When he got to know Anand and Kumar better, they visited night clubs together where they had drinks and the company of ladies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In May or June 2006, Kumar asked him to help in transporting a bag from the Sri Arasakesari Sivan Temple to a canteen in Sungei Kadut. Kumar assured him that there would be no drugs or explosives in the bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_36"></a>36     He followed the instructions and drove his car to the temple and went for prayers. When he returned to his car, there was a bag there, and he drove his car and parked it outside a canteen in Sungei Kadut, and went in for his meal. When he returned from his meal, the bag was removed from his car. Kumar telephoned him to assure him that the bag was collected, and told him that there were safety boots in the bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Then the accused referred to the events of 13 July 2006. That morning Kumar’s foreman, Tamby telephoned him and informed him that Kumar or Rajoo (ie, Sundar, whom the accused knew as Rajoo) would be calling him. Subsequently, Kumar called him and instructed him to be at the temple at 3.30pm. Ten minutes later, Sundar also called and confirmed that he would be at the temple at 3.30 pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The accused went to the temple and found the gate closed, and Sundar was not there. He telephoned Sundar, who told him to wait for him. After speaking to Sundar, the accused received a call from a person he was unable to identify at that time. (During cross-examination, the accused identified Abang to be the person who telephoned him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>) That person told him that he was to go to a canteen at Sungei Kadut. He went to the canteen (which was established at the trial to be the Hawkerway Food Court situated along Sungei Kadut Way). In the toilet of the food court, he met a person he referred to as Abang. Abang asked him if the books had arrived, and he replied in the negative. Abang then handed to him a stack of money<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> and told him that it was workers’ money and that he was to give it to the person who would be bringing the book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_39"></a>39     After he received the money from Abang, he received a call from Sundar that he would be at the temple after 5 o’clock. At about 5.00 pm. the accused returned to the temple. At this time, the gates were open and he drove his car into the temple compound. He parked his car and saw Sundar approaching, carrying a bag. Sundar went into the front passenger seat and placed the bag in the back seat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The accused did not know what was in the bag and thought that it may be some industrial articles or a book. He also thought that Sundar was going with him to deliver the bag. He gave the money he received from Abang to Sundar, and told him that it was money for workers, and then they drove out of the temple compound. When they were at Bukit Timah Road, Sundar suddenly asked him to stop at a bus stop. When he stopped there, Sundar got off, leaving the bag in the car. He asked Sundar about it, and Sundar told him that he or Abang will be calling him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_41"></a>41     At that time, the accused realised that there was a car in front and another car at the rear of his car, and he was suspicious about these cars. He drove off and kept observation on them. He drove for about 20 minutes with the cars trailing him. When he stopped at a traffic light junction along Pioneer Road, the other cars blocked his car and persons (the CNB officers) went to his car and arrested him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_42"></a>42     After he was arrested, he was taken to a trailer park nearby, and was made to sit on the side of the road. He said that at the trailer park, he heard some CNB officers mention “grass” and “glass” in relation to the contents of the bag<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> and he knew that “grass” referred to <em>ganja</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The prosecutor cross-examined the accused at some length. The accused confirmed that he had asked Sundar to buy him a meal, and had called Sundar a <em>kanjan</em> or <em>kanjappaya</em> (a miser) when Sundar declined. He had said that as a joke, and they would both laugh over it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The prosecutor also questioned him on the statement he made at the trailer park. The accused clarified that he heard the officers talking, “they were talking among themselves, and I overheard the word ‘grass’”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> and when his statement was recorded, he was asked in Tamil what the content of the bag was and he replied that it was “grass”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns="">The evidence relating to both statements should be examined with care to determine the weight to be placed on this evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns="">The accused’s statement that “grass” was inside the bag</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The heart of the accused’s evidence in court was that he did not know the contents of the eight wrapped blocks in the bag, and he said “grass” only because he heard CNB officers say that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_49"></a>49     However, he also acknowledged that in his investigation statements, he had alleged that he heard more than “grass”, and this has been quoted in para 15 of this judgment. In short, he had stated in para 45 of his statement of 20 July 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> that “… I had overheard the officers mentioning the term “glass” or “grass” earlier … I only heard the word “glass” or “grass”. In his subsequent statement of 7 August 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> he went on to state at para 58 that “… when the officers asked me about the content of the bag, I replied in English ‘glass’ and not ‘grass’.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Both the accused’s statements of 13 July and 20 July 2006 were recorded in English with Tamil interpretations. The earlier statement was recorded by SSSgt David Ng with Sgt Chelliah Vijay acting as English/Tamil interpreter. Their evidence was that when SSSgt Ng posed the questions to the accused in English, the questions were interpreted into Tamil by Sgt Chelliah. When the accused gave an answer, Sgt Chelliah translated the answer into English. It was also their evidence that when the statement was completed it was read back to the accused in Tamil by Sgt Chelliah and he was given the opportunity to correct it before he signed it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is to be noted that the accused’s evidence on the word he used was inconsistent.

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Sundar’s evidence was clearly inconsistent with and contradictory to his statement of 17 July 2006,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> and consequently, the statement came within the operation of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act that:</p>

<td valign="top" width="95%">
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.</p>

<p class="Judg-1" xmlns="">and the statement was admissible evidence that the accused told him that there was <em>ganja</em> in the bag in the way that direct oral evidence by Sundar would be admissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_63"></a>63     While s 147(3) renders the statement admissible in evidence, the weight to be accorded to the statement has to be determined. When para 17 of the statement of 17 July 2006 becomes admissible as though it was the direct oral evidence of Sundar, it does not mean that para 17 must be regarded as truthful. Admissibility of any evidence and the weight to be accorded to the evidence are separate issues. In a situation where s 147(3) operates, a court must take into account the fact that the witness’ statement is inconsistent with or contradicted by his oral evidence. In such a situation, it is open to the court to find:</p>

<a id="p1_63-p2_i" xmlns=""></a>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I find that Sundar had said that the accused had told him that the bag contained <em>ganja</em>, and that he was not mistaken or deliberately lying when he made the statement. Consequently, I find that Sundar’s statement that the accused told him the bag contained <em>ganja</em> is admissible, and is truthful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns="">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The accused was in possession of the bag containing the cannabis and the cannabis mixture. The prosecution had proved that after his arrest, he acknowledged that the bag contained <em>ganja</em>, and that he had also told Sundar that the bag contained <em>ganja</em>, a term which covers cannabis and cannabis mixture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The prosecutor argued that independently of the accused’s admission and Sundar’s evidence, the accused must be taken to have knowledge of the contents of the bag because he had deliberately kept a blind eye to that, and that was the effect of actual knowledge, as explained in <em>Tan Kiam Peng v PP</em> <nobr>[2008] 1 SLR 1</nobr>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The prosecutor referred to para 41 of the accused’s statement of 20 July 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> where he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns="">I drove off and headed for Jurong with the intention to go to my workplace then. Afterwhich I would wait for ‘Abang’ to call me and arrange for a meeting place to pick up the bag. During this entire time, I did not touch the bag at all. I did not notice whether the bag was locked but I had no intention to see the content inside. I did not want to check the bag as I thought it was better not for me to see. I suspected that something was not right, and the bag might contain something illegal. I had this suspicion because if the content was legal, they would not need to be so discreet. Only then I realized that they were using me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Although the accused said in court that he had no opportunity to inspect the bag as he was trying to flee from the suspected gangsters and thugs in the cars which trailed him. I reject this explanation because he had not mentioned in that statement. In addition to that, a further statement was recorded from him on 7 August 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> after the statement of 20 July 2006 was read back and explained to him. In this later statement, he made two clarifications to the statement of 20 July 2006, but he again did not mention that he could not examine the bag because he was fleeing from those persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I therefore find that even if the accused did not have actual knowledge of the contents of the bag, his wilful blindness has the same legal effect as actual knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In view of the quantities of cannabis and cannabis mixture in the bag (which were not disputed), a presumption arose under s 17 of the Act that the accused had those drugs for the purpose of trafficking, as “traffic” being defined in s 2 to be:</p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns="">(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2" xmlns="">(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (<em>a</em>),</p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns="">and the accused has not rebutted the presumption that the drugs were in his possession for the purpose of trafficking as his case is that he was keeping the bag for Sundar or Abang, ie, that he intended to send or deliver the bag to either of them. With those elements established, the accused had trafficked in the drugs under s 5(2) of the Act:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid" width="95%" xmlns="">

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="95%">
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Consequently, I find the accused guilty and convict him on the two charges that he faces, and I impose the death sentence on him for each charge.</p>
