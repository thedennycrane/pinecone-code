        Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerned the sale by the liquidator
                    of the plaintiff company, Norwest Holdings Pte Ltd (in
                    liquidation)(“Norwest”) of the entire share capital of its
                    wholly-owned subsidiary, Norwest Chemicals Pte Ltd (“Norwest
                    Chemicals”), to the defendant, Newport Mining Limited
                    (“Newport”). That sale was aborted as a consequence of the
                    earthquake in Sichuan on 12 May 2008 and the events which followed.
                    Norwest’s action was brought to recover the sum of $5.6475m as damages
                    arising from Newport’s failure to complete the purchase of the entire
                    share capital of Norwest Chemicals. Newport denied that there was a valid and
                    binding contract of sale between itself and Norwest and counterclaimed for the
                    return of the $102,500 deposit it placed with Norwest. On 4 November 2009,
                    I delivered oral judgment dismissing Norwest’s claim and allowing
                    Newport’s counterclaim. Norwest has since appealed against my decision. I
                    now set out and elaborate upon the brief grounds I gave in my oral
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I begin with a brief overview of the facts and the parties’ legal
                    arguments. As stated, Norwest is in liquidation. Its principal asset is its
                    shares (“the NC Shares”) in a wholly owned subsidiary, Norwest
                    Chemicals who, in turn, is the sole shareholder of a Chinese company, Sichuan
                    Mianzhu Norwest Phosphate Chemical Company Limited (“Norwest
                    China”). Norwest China owns the mining rights to two phosphate rock mines
                    (“the Mines”) for a period up to 2015. It also owns production
                    facilities described in Norwest’s statement of claim as including,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, a 30,000 metric tonnes per annum
                    (“mtpa”) sodium and potassium phosphate production facility and a
                    6,000 mtpa facility for acid production (“the Production
                    Facilities”). The Production Facilities and the Mines are located in the
                    Sichuan province of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).
                    Specifically the Production Facilities are located in Hangwang, Mianzhu while
                    the mines are located north of Mianzhu, approximately 45kim away from the
                    Production Facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Essentially, Newport had made a “Firm
                    Letter of Offer” to buy the NC Shares for a price of $10.25m. Norwest
                    argued that this was an offer in the legal sense capable of becoming a contract
                    upon acceptance. Newport rejected the stance taken. It argued that the offer was
                    made subject to the conclusion of a formal contract. In any event, it was common
                    ground that, after Newport made the Firm Letter of Offer, a massive earthquake
                    (“the Sichuan earthquake”) measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale
                    struck the Sichuan province at 2.28 pm Singapore time on 12 May 2008. Two
                    hours later, Norwest’s liquidator, Mr Lai Seng Kwoon, purported to
                    accept the Firm Letter of Offer. Newport argued that even if the Firm Letter of
                    Offer was an offer in the legal sense, it would have lapsed as a result of the
                    damage wrought to Norwest China’s business, which was the underlying basis
                    of the offer, by the Sichuan earthquake. Norwest argued that, as the sale was
                    conducted on an “as is, where is” basis, and in any case was in
                    relation to the NC Shares and not Norwest China’s business, Newport
                    remained bound to complete. The deadline for completion, fixed for 1 June
                    2008, came and went without the sale being completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After the sale of the NC shares fell through,
                    Norwest’s liquidator sold the NC Shares to Norwest’s holding
                    company, Hwa Hong Edible Oil Industries (“Hwa Hong”), for $4.5m.
                    That sale to Hwa Hong was said to be in mitigation of Newport’s breach in
                    failing to complete. I pause here to highlight that Hwa Hong was a creditor of
                    about 90% (approximately $4.1m) of Norwest’s debts and a shareholder of
                    49.5% of its shares. This meant that Hwa Hong did not need to pay much in cash
                    for its purchase of the NC Shares and stood to gain as a contributory, a
                    substantial portion of the sum of $5.6475m claimed as damages by Norwest in this
                    action. Hwa Hong seems well aware of this – it is indemnifying
                    Norwest’s liquidator for his prosecution of this action to the tune of
                    $800,000. It is also worth noting that in May 2008 Norwest’s liquidator
                    was already in contact with Mr Simon Ong, the Chief Financial Officer of
                    Hwa Hong, on the status of the sale of the NC Shares to Newport.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> While this background is
                    strictly irrelevant to the issues before me, I must say that Norwest’s
                    sale of the NC Shares to Hwa Hong struck me as highly opportunistic and
                    tactical.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The liquidator’s sale of, and Newport’s “Firm
                Letter of Offer” for the NC Shares on an “as is, where is”
                basis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       I turn now to a more detailed examination of the
                    facts surrounding the liquidator’s sale the NC Shares. As part
                    Norwest’s liquidation, its liquidator produced an Information Memorandum
                    providing details about Norwest Chemicals and Norwest China, as well as the
                    basis and format of the proposed sale of the entire share capital of Norwest
                    Chemicals. The Executive Summary in the Information Memorandum described Norwest
                    Chemicals and Norwest China’s operations as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Norwest Chemicals] was founded in 1996 with a stated mission “to
                        become a vertically integrated manufacturer and supplier of phosphorous,
                        phosphate chemicals and phosphorous derivatives under ISO9002 and ISO14001
                        standards, delivering these products to the world through a seamless supply
                        chain system”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Norwest Chemicals] has a phosphorous production base in Sichuan, China,
                        through its participation as a majority partner in a 60% – 40% joint
                        venture with an existing phosphorous manufacturer. This allowed them to
                        secure a supply of Yellow Phosphorous, the essential raw material to
                        manufacture phosphate chemicals and phosphorous derivatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In March 1997, [Norwest China] constructed a 30,000 MTPA Sodium and
                        Potassium Phosphate production facility, based on technology acquired from
                        Monsanto of the United States of America. Construction was completed in
                        September 1998 and provided [Norwest China] with the ability to produce many
                        different food and industrial grade sodium and potassium phosphate
                        chemicals... To meet the increased demand for phosphoric acid to produce the
                        downstream chemicals, [Norwest China] also built a 6,000 MTPA facility for
                        acid production.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In 2000, [Norwest China] became the first chemicals manufacturer in
                        Mianzhu to be certified with both ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 Quality and
                        Environmental Standards. In 2002, they acquire the mining rights to a 50,000
                        MTPA phosphate rock mine for a period up to 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Norwest China] was re-incorporated as a wholly-owned Foreign Enterprise
                        on 26 September 2002, after [Norwest Chemicals] acquired all of the
                        other partners’ equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen from the description, Norwest China operated a
                    vertically-integrated phosphate mining, processing and production business
                    – a fact which was accepted by both sides. The business also included the
                    sale of phosphorous, phosphate chemicals and phosphorous derivatives. For
                    convenience, I will refer to the entire business of Norwest China as the
                    “Chinese Business”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The basis of the proposed sale of the NC Shares
                    was described as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is the intention of the liquidator to sell NC [<em>ie</em>, Norwest Chemicals] together with NC China [<em>ie</em> Norwest China] in its present state and condition
                        on an “<em>as is, where is</em>” basis
                        and subject to a Sale and Purchase Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The proposed sale was advertised in a similar
                    fashion in The Australian and the Business Times. The advertisements in both
                    newspapers were identical and the material part read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Newport is a mining and resource exploration
                    company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. On 27 February 2008,
                    Newport first expressed an interest in acquiring the entire share capital of
                    Norwest Chemicals, through Michael Cawley of Taylor Collison Limited, an
                    Australian financial services firm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Simon Taylor, a director of
                    Newport who is a geologist by training, also became involved in the negotiations
                    process. In the bid process, Messrs Taylor and Cawley worked with David Argyle,
                    a shareholder and director of Norwest who has considerable experience in the
                    mining and resource industry. Messrs Taylor, Cawley and Argyle all gave evidence
                    on behalf of Newport at trial. For convenience and ease of understanding, I will
                    refer to the negotiations as occurring between Norwest’s liquidator and
                    Newport and identify individuals only when necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 4 April 2008, Newport submitted its
                    Expression of Interest in the form of Appendix A of the Information Memorandum,
                    formally indicating its interest in purchasing the NC Shares for $5.5m. This was
                    the first time Newport indicated a price. The material part of the Expression of
                    Interest read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on the information currently made available to us, we hereby submit
                        to you an Expression of Interest in the shares held by Norwest Holdings Pte
                        Ltd (in liquidation) in Norwest Chemicals Pte Ltd on an “as is, where
                        is” basis for an amount of Singapore Dollars S$5,500,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Expression of Interest is made on the condition that in acquiring the
                        shares of Norwest Chemicals Pte Ltd, we will gain 100% control of Sichuan
                        Mianzhu Norwest Phosphate Chemicals Co Ltd, a 100% subsidiary owned by
                        Norwest Chemicals Pte Ltd.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event we should make a firm offer for Norwest Chemicals Pte Ltd and

                        terms and conditions set out in the Sale and Purchase Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Around 16 April 2008, Norwest’s
                    liquidator began to make arrangements for Newport to carry out due diligence on
                    Norwest China and the Chinese Business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> In particular, site visits were
                    arranged; however, Newport’s attempts to visit the Mines were twice
                    aborted because of landslides which temporarily prevented vehicular access to
                    the Mines. Most of the accounts of Norwest Chemicals and Norwest China were also
                    made available for Newport’s inspection. On 2 May 2008, Newport
                    submitted its Firm Letter of Offer in the template in Appendix B of the
                    Information Memorandum (with some amendments which I shall come to in a moment),
                    offering to purchase the NC Shares for $10m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In the cover letter for the Firm Letter
                    of Offer, Newport indicated that it was willing to consider revising its offer
                    upwards if (a) Norwest China resolved its ongoing litigation and secured the
                    release of its “frozen” bank accounts, and (b) that Newport be
                    allowed to review the accounts for Norwest Chemicals and Norwest China for the
                    past 3 years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    Norwest’s liquidator acted to accommodate those requests and on 9 May
                    2008 Newport submitted a second Firm Letter of Offer for $10.25m <em>via</em> email which material part read as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Newport’s second Firm Letter of Offer
                    contained some changes from the original template provided in the Information
                    Memorandum and it read as follows (with the changes emphasised):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have conducted our independent assessment of the available information

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The same changes were also made in the first
                    Firm Letter of Offer submitted by Newport. For convenience, I will refer to the
                    second Firm Letter of Offer of 9 May 2008 – which is the document in
                    issue – as the “9 May Offer”. As can be seen from the
                    quotation above, the 9 May Offer was stated to be irrevocable and valid for
                    a period of 45 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The basis of Newport’s interest in the
                    NC Shares was explained by Mr Taylor in his evidence-in-chief as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the acquisition of [Norwest Chemicals] … presented the
                        opportunity of acquiring a phosphate mining and processing business that was
                        already in operation and creating revenue. In my opinion, it was important
                        for [Newport] to acquire a cash generating business to enable [Newport] to
                        differentiate itself from the other exploration companies listed on the ASX.
                        This was one of the main attractions of the [Norwest Chemicals] acquisition
                        to [Newport].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of [Norwest Chemicals], the [Mines] had already proven the
                        capable of producing phosphate rock…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the Information Memorandum itself notes, the Mines still had the
                        potential to yield even more phosphate rock, as it had not reached its
                        maximum stated production capacity of 100,000 mtpa. The mining rights lasted
                        until December 2015…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for the [Production Facilities], it was capable of refining the
                        phosphate rock into a variety of phosphate products, including yellow
                        phosphorous, phosphoric acid, sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium
                        tripolyphosphate. Like the Mines, the [Production Facilities] were producing
                        these downstream phosphate products at healthy figures, but not at 100%
                        capacity…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on [the figures provided in the Information Memorandum], it appeared
                        that NCPL was a potentially good investment opportunity for the
                        Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 12 May 2008 (<em>ie</em>, three days after the 9 May Offer was sent), at
                    2.28 pm Singapore time, the Sichuan earthquake, which as said measured 7.9
                    on the Richter scale, struck. Judicial notice may be taken of the severity of
                    the Sichuan earthquake from the following description of the general effect of
                    the earthquake on the United States Geological Survey webpage:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At least 69,195 people killed, 374,177 injured and 18,392 missing and
                        presumed dead in the Chengdu-Lixian-Guangyuan area. More than 45.5 million
                        people in 10 provinces and regions were affected. At least 15 million people
                        were evacuated from their homes and more than 5 million were left homeless.
                        An estimated 5.36 million buildings collapsed and more than 21 million
                        buildings were damaged in Sichuan and in parts of Chongqing, Gansu, Hubei,
                        Shaanxi and Yunnan. The total economic loss was estimated at 86 billion US
                        dollars. Beichuan, Dujiangyan, Wuolong and Yingxiu were almost completely
                        destroyed. Landslides and rockfalls damaged or destroyed several mountain
                        roads and railways and buried buildings in the Beichuan-Wenchuan area,
                        cutting off access to the region for several days. At least 700 people were
                        buried by a landslide at Qingchuan. Landslides also dammed several rivers,
                        creating 34 barrier lakes which threatened about 700,000 people downstream.
                        A train was buried by a landslide near Longnan, Gansu. At least 2,473 dams
                        sustained some damage and more than 53,000 km of roads and 48,000 km of tap
                        water pipelines were damaged. About 1.5 km of surface faulting was observed
                        near Qingchuan, surface cracks and fractures occurred on three mountains in
                        the area, and subsidence and street cracks were observed in the city itself.
                        Maximum intensity XI was assigned in the Wenchuan area. Felt (VIII) at
                        Deyang and Mianyang; (VII) at Chengdu; (VI) at Luzhou and Xi'an; (V) at
                        Chongqing, Guozhen, Lanzhou, Leshan, Wu'an, Xichang and Ya'an. Felt in much
                        of central, eastern and southern China, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Hefei,
                        Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan and Hong Kong. Also felt in parts of
                        Bangladesh, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Seiches were observed at
                        Kotalipara, Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Specifically, the epicentre of the earthquake was 94 km from the
                    Production Facilities, which were located at Hanwang Town – a district of
                    Mianzhu City. As mentioned, it was not disputed that the assets of the Chinese
                    Business were damaged as a result of the Sichuan earthquake. However, as the
                    significance of the damage to the Chinese Business was disputed by the parties,
                    I will refer to the details later on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Roughly two hours after the Sichuan earthquake
                    (4.20 pm Singapore time) the secretary to Norwest’s liquidator sent an
                    email attaching the liquidator’s letter addressed to Newport purporting to
                    accept the 9 May Offer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> In the same letter, Norwest’s
                    liquidator reminded Newport that the timeline for the completion of the sale had
                    earlier (on 10 April 2008) been moved forward to 1 June 2008 from
                    13 June 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The liquidator said in his affidavit
                    of evidence-in-chief that he did not know about the Sichuan earthquake when he
                    purported to accept the 9 May Offer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> He was
                    not challenged on this aspect of his evidence, even though the timing of his
                    purported acceptance could have raised a brow or two.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     One day later, on 13 May 2008, Newport
                    emailed Norwest’s liquidator, the material part of the email read as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you for your letter of acceptance. We will work towards the deadline
                        of 1 June 2008 as per the original schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I will give you details of our lawyers shortly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the same email, Newport also asked the
                    liquidator to advise on the condition of the Mines and Production Facilities. On
                    the next day, 14 May 2009, Newport paid $47,500, being the outstanding
                    portion of the required 1% deposit of $102,500, to Norwest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> It was not disputed, and I
                    think it cannot be disputed, that at the time of payment, which was only two
                    days after the Sichuan earthquake, Newport was not aware of the actual extent of
                    damage to the Mines and Production Facilities. On 15 May 2008, Newport
                    again asked the liquidator for information on the casualties and damage suffered
                    by the Chinese Business. Mr Taylor testified that the information:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">was necessary to assess the impact of the earthquake on production
                        capacities of the [Production Facilities] and [the Mines], environmental
                        issues, [Norwest China’s] ability to produce cash flow and service its
                        debt requirements, the impact of the earthquake damage on the mining
                        licences, as well as [Norwest China’s] ability to remain a going
                        concern. ... [A]ccording to the Information Memorandum, the licences may be
                        contingent upon continued operation of the [Production
                            Facilities].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Norwest’s liquidator had on 13 May
                    2008 said in an email to Newport, that he “ha[d] not been able to
                    establish any contact with the people there [<em>ie</em>,
                    in the PRC] as the phone lines are apparently down” but that he would
                    keep Newport informed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>
                    However, no information was subsequently supplied. In the absence of any
                    information from the liquidator, Mr Argyle, together with Lee Gray, a
                    Chengdu accountant who was part of Newport’s due diligence team, visited
                    the site to assess the damage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>
                    Subsequently, Newport assessed that, because of the damage wrought by the
                    Sichuan earthquake, the Chinese Business was no longer in the same state and
                    condition as at the time of the 9 May Offer. Mr Taylor said in his
                    evidence-in-chief that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the evidence that [Newport] had available, it became increasingly clear
                        that the basis upon which [Newport’s] offer was made – the
                        [Production Facilities] and [the Mines’] production capacities –
                        had been severely affected, if not completely disrupted, by the devastating
                        effect of the earthquake. [Newport] thus decided not to go ahead with the
                        transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Furthermore, in this case, the [Mines] and [Production Facilities] were
                        not operational. This obviously had a significant impact on the cash flow of
                        Norwest China, as well as the ability of Norwest China to service the debt
                        of RMB 27 million. If the [Mines] and [Production Facilities] could generate
                        no cash flow, there was obviously no basis for [Newport] to acquire [Norwest
                        Chemicals] just to be saddled with a large debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 3 June 2008, Newport’s
                    solicitors informed Norwest’s then-solicitors that Newport would not be
                    going ahead with the purchase of the NC Shares. According to Newport’s
                    solicitors, there was no binding and enforceable contract between the parties in
                    the first place. Further, the 9 May Offer was “premised on the basis
                    that the aforesaid mines, factory and/or their surrounding infrastructure would
                    remain in the same condition at the time of acceptance and/or contract as at the
                    time of the offer.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> This basis was undermined
                    by the Sichuan earthquake, and as a result the 9 May Offer was no longer
                    capable of acceptance after 2.28 pm on 12 May 2008 – the time in
                    Singapore at which the Sichuan earthquake occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As mentioned, Norwest then purported to
                    mitigate its loss of bargain by selling the NC Shares to its (Norwest’s)
                    parent company, Hwa Hong, for $4.5m. Hwa Hong’s Firm Letter of Offer was
                    dated 25 July 2008 and was accepted by Norwest’s liquidator on
                    29 July 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The sale was completed on 1 August 2008
                    when Norwest transferred the NC Shares to Hwa Hong’s nominee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Norwest then
                    brought suit against Newport for $5.6475m – that sum being the difference
                    between Newport’s price ($10.25m), the sum of the mitigation price ($4.5m)
                    and the 1% deposit already paid by Newport ($102,500).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Newport’s application to amend its defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In this suit, Newport was represented by
                    Mr Ang Cheng Hock SC. After the trial, Mr Ang applied by way of
                    Summons No 4559 of 2009 to amend para 26 of Newport’s defence as
                    follows (with the amendments underlined):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further and alternatively, the Defendant avers that, even if the
                        9 May 2008 Letter constituted a valid legal offer capable of acceptance
                        (which is denied), <u>the offer was subject to an implied
                            condition that the Mining Facilities would remain in substantially the
                            same condition as when the offer was made</u>. The extensive
                        damage caused to the Mining Facilities by the Earthquake, and the severe
                        difficulties involved in attempting to resume normal operations at the
                        damaged Mining Facilities after the Earthquake, <u>resulted
                            in the implied condition to the offer being fulfilled, and/or</u>
                        destroyed the underlying basis upon which the offer was made and/or rendered
                        the underlying basis essentially or radically different, such that the offer
                        was no longer capable of being accepted by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I heard the application in chambers on
                    15 October 2009 just before parties made their closing submissions in open
                    court. Counsel for Norwest, Mr David Chan, did not oppose Newport’s
                    application to amend, but commented that para 26 appeared to raise an issue
                    of common mistake, which he had prepared to meet. Mr Ang clarified and
                    confirmed that Newport was not pleading common mistake, and in particular the
                    averment in para 26 that the Sichuan earthquake “destroyed the
                    underlying basis upon which the offer was made and/or rendered the underlying
                    basis essentially or radically different” was not to be read and
                    understood as raising common mistake. Mr Ang further clarified that
                    Newport’s case was founded on an implied condition as pleaded in the
                    amended para 26. I allowed the application with costs to Norwest, which I
                    fixed at $2,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first issue: whether a binding contract was formed immediately
                upon Norwest’s acceptance of Newport’s 9 May Offer – the
                “subject to contract” defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I turn now to the substantive issues raised by
                    the parties. The first issue, which I broadly referred to as the “subject
                    to contract” defence in my oral judgment, concerns whether the 9 May
                    Offer was an offer in the legal sense and thereby capable of forming a binding
                    contract upon Norwest’s acceptance of the May Offer. The issue arises from
                    the express wording in the 9 May Offer – in particular, the
                    Newport’s Australian solicitors' amendment to the template Firm Letter of
                    Offer to provide that it was “subject to the terms and conditions in the
                    Sale and Purchase Agreement <em>to be
                    negotiated</em>” instead of simply “subject to the term and
                    conditions in the Sale and Purchase Agreement”. Mr Ang on behalf of
                    Newport submitted that, as a result of this addition, the 9 May Offer was
                    not an offer in the legal sense, but a non-binding offer made subject to
                    contract. Mr Ang also referred to item (vi) of the table in the Information
                    Memorandum (set out at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above), which
                    stated that the liquidator’s acceptance was “subject to agreement
                    on terms and conditions” – with the negotiation and conclusion of
                    the Sale and Purchase Agreement being the next step.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In response, Mr Chan submitted that the
                    deliberate addition of the phrase “to be negotiated” did not in
                    this case have the effect of deferring the formation of a binding contract as
                    there were no significant matters requiring further agreement between the
                    parties. Mr Ang disagreed, arguing that there were conditions precedent of
                    importance to Newport that remained to be negotiated and agreed, referring in
                    this regard to Mr Taylor’s evidence on the various terms required by
                        Newport,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> and also to
                    Mr Cawley’s testimony to similar effect. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Essentially, the parties’ arguments
                    raised two questions, which they appear to have conflated: (1) whether, after
                    Norwest’s purported acceptance of Newport’s 9 May Offer, there
                    remained essential issues on which the parties had yet to agree upon, such that
                    no contract could arise; and (2) whether Newport in the 9 May Offer evinced
                    an intention to enter into legal relations immediately upon Norwest’s
                    acceptance instead of deferring the creation of legal relations until a formal
                    and complete contract was drawn up. The two questions are based on distinct
                    requirements for the formation of a contract. Question (1) concerns the
                    requirement for substantial agreement between the parties. Question (2) concerns
                    the separate requirement that the parties must intend to create legal relations.
                    The two requirements are related in the limited sense that, in the commercial
                    context, a substantially complete agreement may give rise to a <em>prima facie</em> inference, which may be confirmed or
                    displaced by other facts, that legal relations are intended. More generally,
                    however, the requirements are, nonetheless, distinct and the fulfilment of one
                    does not necessarily entail the fulfilment of the other: parties may reach
                    complete agreement but defer the creation of legal relations between them until
                    the occurrence of some formality or other event; or they may ostensibly agree
                    with all formalities but omit to address essential matters thereby creating
                    uncertainties or incompleteness. With that clarification, I turn to address
                    questions (1) and (2) in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Question 1: whether substantial agreement was reached</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Cases such as <em>May and
                        Butcher, Limited v The King</em> [1934] 2 KB 17 illustrate
                    that an agreement will not be regarded as a binding contract if essential
                    matters, without which the contract is too uncertain or incomplete to be
                    workable, remain to be agreed upon. Conversely put, the parties must reach
                    substantial or essential agreement before a contract can be regarded as
                    concluded. At the same time, it should be emphasised that what is required is
                    substantial or essential agreement and not complete agreement. A contract may be
                    regarded as having been formed even though it has not been worked out in
                    meticulous detail. Similarly if a contract calls for further agreement between
                    the parties, the absence of further agreement between the parties will vitiate
                    the contract only if it makes it unworkable or void for uncertainty. Here it is
                    helpful to refer to the pertinent part of Lloyd LJ’s summary of the
                    applicable principles in <em>Pagnan S.p.A v Feed Products
                        Ltd</em> [1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 601 (at 619):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) … the parties may intend to be bound forthwith even though
                        there are further terms still to be agreed or some further formality to be
                        fulfilled (see <em>Love and Stewart v Instone</em>
                        [(1917) 33 TLR 475] per Lord Loreburn at p 476).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) If the parties fail to reach agreement on such further terms, the
                        existing contract is not invalidated unless the failure to reach agreement
                        on such further terms renders the contract as a whole unworkable or void for
                        uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) … It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to be bound
                        and, if so, by what terms, whether important or unimportant. It is the
                        parties who are, in the memorable phrase coined by the Judge, “the
                        masters of their contractual fate.” Of course, the more important the
                        term is the less likely it is that the parties will have left it for future
                        decision. But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of the
                        parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be
                        agreed later. It happens every day when parties enter into so-called
                        “heads of agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">See also <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, Vol 1
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30<sup>th</sup> ed, 2008) at
                    paras 2-113 and 2-128 (“<em>Chitty</em>”). Whether substantial or essential agreement has been
                    reached is a question of fact to be decided with regard to all the circumstances
                    of the parties’ dealings with each other, including in particular the
                    nature of the transaction envisaged by the parties. It is worthwhile to bear in
                    mind Lloyd LJ’s reminder in <em>Pagnan</em>
                    that, in deciding whether a matter is essential, it is the intention of the
                    parties, and not the opinion of the court, which is decisive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the facts in evidence, the parties had
                    agreed on several points. They agreed to transfer all the NC Shares to Newport.
                    They agreed on the price, <em>ie</em>, $10.25m. They agreed
                    on the allocation of risk – the 9 May Offer stated that the
                    transaction was based on Newport’s independent assessment of the available
                    information, and the Information Memorandum and Expression of Interest similarly
                    stated that the transaction was on an “as is, where is” basis (a
                    point to which I will return later on). In other words, the parties had agreed
                    on the price, subject-matter, and risk, when Norwest accepted Newport’s
                    9 May Offer. These factors are obviously the most essential matters in a
                    sale and purchase transaction – and <em>a
                        fortiori</em> in the case of a liquidation sale on an “as is,
                    where is” basis. As Andrew Stilton writes in <em>Sale of
                        Shares and Businesses: Law, practice and agreements</em>,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> ed (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2006) at
                    p 445, buyers in a liquidation sale have to</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">accept that in such transaction they will be buying “as
                        seen” and will have no come-back if for example any of the assets of
                        the business are subject to an encumbrance in favour of a third party or are
                        in a poor state of repair and condition or even if there are assets which
                        the buyer thinks that he is buying but which he never actually manages to
                        get his hands on – for example there may be plant which appears in a
                        plant register but which has in fact been scrapped.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In short, there is no place for the extensive
                    representations, warranties and guarantees which might be found in normal sale
                    and purchase agreements. In this regard, I accepted the liquidator’s
                    evidence that he was selling the NC Shares on an “as is, where is”
                    basis and was in no position to give any warranty or representation. There was
                    no contemporaneous evidence to show that the list of matters which
                    Mr Taylor said remained to be negotiated between the parties were raised
                    with Norwest’s liquidator or in the actual contemplation of Newport at the
                    relevant time. The list seemed to be created <em>ex post
                        facto</em> for the purposes of this litigation. I was also unconvinced
                    by Mr Cawley’s evidence that Newport would possibly not have
                    contracted to buy the NC Shares if it was not made a condition precedent that
                    the shares were free from encumbrances.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> The truth
                    of the matter was that Norwest’s liquidator had made it known from the
                    outset in drafting the Information Memorandum and again in his letter dated
                    10 April 2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> that
                    he could not commit Norwest to any warranties or undertakings. Mr Taylor,
                    on his part, confirmed in cross-examination that he had seen that letter and
                    that the 9 May Offer was made on the understanding that the liquidator was
                    not in a position to give any warranties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the circumstances, I found that the parties
                    did reach substantial agreement when Norwest accepted Newport’s 9 May
                    Offer on 12 May 2008. It would have been only incomplete as to the
                    mechanics of the sale, and that would not prevent any contract from coming into
                    existence as the mechanics could easily be supplied by the court having regard
                    to what is usual and reasonable in the circumstances (see <em>Chitty</em>, at paras 2-113 to 2-114 and 2-128).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Question 2: whether legal relations were intended</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I turn to question (2), <em>ie</em>, whether Newport intended to enter into legal relations with
                    Norwest immediately upon the latter’s acceptance of the 9 May Offer.
                    As stated, Mr Ang argued that there was no offer in a legal sense because
                    Newport’s 9 May Offer was made “subject to the terms and
                    conditions in the Sale and Purchase Agreement to be negotiated” (see
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Before addressing this argument, it is
                    necessary to deal with some of the evidence Mr Ang relied on: specifically,
                    the minutes of a meeting of Newport’s board of directors purporting to
                    record the understanding that Newport’s 9 May Offer was ‘still
                    subject to the signing of a “Sale and Purchase
                        Agreement”’<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> and certain emails between
                    Norwest’s liquidator and Mr Ong of Hwa Hong, whose contents
                    Mr Ang read to mean that Norwest’s liquidator doubted that an offer
                    in the legal sense had been made to Norwest. It is convenient to reproduce the
                    email thread here.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> The email thread began with the
                    liquidator forwarding Newport’s email of 13 May 2008 (reproduced at
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above) thanking the liquidator for
                    his “letter of acceptance” to Mr Ong, with the following
                    message added:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have to take steps to preserve the value of the business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It must be stated that, in finding an
                    intention to enter into legal relations, and more generally, an intention to
                    make or accept an offer, the law is predominantly concerned with the objective
                    intentions of a party, and not his subjective or actual intentions (see
                        <em>eg Projection Pte Ltd v The Tai Ping Insurance Co
                        Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 798 at [15]). Specifically, the
                    objective approach determines a party’s intentions by looking at all of
                    his words and conduct directed towards his counterparty from the perspective of
                    a reasonable man versed in business. The obvious rationale for the objective
                    approach is to enable parties to deal in reliance on each others’ manifest
                    intentions. It follows from this rationale that there is an exception to the
                    objective approach where a party’s actual intention differs from his
                    apparent intention, <em>and</em> this is <em>actually</em> known to his counterparty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the facts, I rejected as irrelevant the
                    minutes of the Newport board mentioned at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above to finding Newport’s intention, if any, to
                    enter into legal relations. The minutes of Newport’s board were an
                    internal document of Newport which was not known to Norwest, which to all
                    appearances dealt with Newport at arm’s length. They would not therefore,
                    be relevant to deciding whether or not Newport evinced an intention to enter
                    into legal relations. In any case not much weight could be given to the minutes,
                    since they were only signed by Mr Taylor on 29 August 2008, when the
                    relationship between the parties had already turned adversarial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As for the emails between Norwest’s
                    liquidator and Mr Ong, they did not, in the first place, evinced any kind
                    of belief on the liquidator’s part that Newport did not mean to make an
                    offer. Rather, Mr Ong and the liquidator seemed to be concerned that
                    Newport might walk away from the bargain it made, and that the mechanics of the
                    transaction, which remained to be agreed, should be structured to guard against
                    this possibility. This was a practical concern which had nothing to do with
                    whether Mr Ong and Norwest’s liquidator believed that Newport
                    intended to enter into legal relations. I have earlier held that the absence of
                    mechanics did not prevent an agreement from arising. In any case, the subjective
                    beliefs of the liquidator, whatever they might be, were irrelevant since they
                    were not shown to arise from any knowledge of Newport’s actual
                    intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Returning to the question whether Newport
                    intended to enter into legal relations with Norwest immediately upon the
                    latter’s acceptance of the 9 May Offer, I took into account the
                    following facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the structure of the bidding
                        process, as set out in the table in the Information Memorandum (reproduced
                        at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above), appears to contemplate the
                        9 May Offer as the stage where legal relations are created.
                        Specifically, the stage represented by the 9 May Offer stands in
                        contrast to the Expression of Interest stage, not only in the label attached
                        to each stage, but also in the fact that “acceptance” by the
                        liquidator may occur at the Firm Letter of Offer stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the language that Newport used
                        in the correspondence accompanying the 9 May Offer was compatible with
                        an intention to create legal relations immediately upon Norwest’s
                        acceptance. A cover letter with a distinctly formal format and tone was
                        attached in contrast to the relatively informal tone that characterised the
                        prior discussions between the parties. In the email (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), Newport referred to the
                        attachment in its own words as a “firm offer”. Also, both the
                        email and the cover letter stated that Newport looked forward to receiving
                        Norwest’s “formal response”. All this would not be
                        necessary, and would indeed be rather incongruous, if the 9 May Offer
                        was only an intermediate step in the process with no legal significance of
                        its own.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, a holistic view of the 9 May Offer points towards an
                        intention to create legal relations. Here it should be emphasised that
                        Newport did not plainly and distinctly invoke the formula “subject to
                        contract”; its amendment to the template Firm Letter of Offer was
                        rather ambiguous. If the formula “subject to contract” had
                        been invoked in a separate and distinct part of the document to make the
                        9 May Offer plainly subject to contract, the court would require very
                        strong and exceptional circumstances to displace the settled business
                        meaning of the phrase, which was to delay the creation of legal relations
                        until a formal contract was signed (see <em>Chillingworth v
                            Esche</em> [1924] 1 Ch 97; and <em>Alpenstow Ltd v Regalian Properties plc</em> [1985]
                        1 WLR 721). But it was not; the 9 May Offer was made to
                        purchase the NC Shares “subject to the terms and conditions in the
                        Sale and Purchase Agreement to be negotiated”, with the phrase
                        “to be negotiated” added by Newport (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). In my view, the phrase,
                        objectively read, meant that the purchase <em>would take
                            place</em> in accordance with the terms and conditions in the
                        eventual Sale and Purchase Agreement, which were, as Newport stipulated,
                        “to be negotiated.” This reading is fortified and confirmed by
                        the second paragraph of the 9 May Offer, which stated that “In
                        the event [Newport’s] offer is accepted, [Newport] agree[s] to the
                        aforesaid purchase price and <em>will pay the
                            balance</em>, less the [deposit] that has been submitted to you,
                            <em>in accordance to the terms and conditions set out in
                            the Sale and Purchase Agreement to be negotiated</em>”
                        (emphasis added). The wording of the second paragraph makes clear that,
                        while the precise mechanics were to be negotiated, there would be a binding
                        obligation on Newport to pay the balance of the price once Norwest accepted
                        the offer – Newport “<em>will</em> pay the
                        balance” (emphasis added). It would be inconsistent, therefore, to
                        read the first paragraph as delaying the creation of legal relations until a
                        formal contract was signed, and since there was a viable alternative
                        (mentioned above) I declined to do so. In my view, Newport’s unwieldy
                        amendment to the template Firm Letter of Offer served only to highlight the
                        need to negotiate and formalise the mechanics of the sale and purchase of
                        the NC Shares; it failed to make any agreement between the parties
                        “subject to contract” in the technical sense of the term, if
                        indeed that was Newport’s intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, some weight could be given to the
                        fact, which I have found at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above,
                        that the parties had in fact reached agreement on the essential aspects of
                        the transaction – the sale and purchase of the NC Shares on an
                        “as is, where is” basis at a price of $10.25m. (I will later
                        on deal with the implications of the fact that the transaction was on an
                        “as is, where is” basis).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifthly, there is the fact that, on 13 May
                        2008 (<em>ie</em>, the day after the Sichuan earthquake
                        and Norwest’s acceptance), Newport thanked Norwest for its
                        “acceptance”, and stated that it “will work towards the
                        deadline of 1 June 2008 as per the original schedule.” Mr Ang
                        argued that this only evidenced the existence of an agreement to negotiate,
                        but the evidence plainly refuted this. As I have found, the parties had
                        reached agreement on the essential aspects of the transaction. In addition,
                        it is significant that Newport reaffirmed its commitment to the deadline of
                        1 June 2008, which was the deadline for the completion of the sale
                        fixed by Norwest’s liquidator on 10 April 2008 and reiterated on
                        12 May 2008 in the letter accepting Newport’s 9 May
                        Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I therefore found that Newport did evince an
                    intention to enter into legal relations immediately upon Norwest’s
                    acceptance of the 9 May Offer. Given my earlier finding that the parties
                    had reached substantial agreement, I further found that, putting aside any
                    effect of the Sichuan earthquake and the consequent damage to the Chinese
                    Business which is discussed below, the parties had entered into a valid and
                    binding agreement immediately upon Norwest’s acceptance of the 9 May
                    Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second issue: the subject-matter of the contract and the effect
                of the Sichuan earthquake – the construction point</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The next issue that arose for consideration
                    was what I referred to in my oral judgment as the construction point. Under this
                    heading, I will consider the effect of the Sichuan earthquake, if any, on the
                    subject-matter of the contract between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The subject-matter of the contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Mr Chan strenuously argued that the
                    subject-matter of the contract was the NC Shares and the NC Shares alone, and
                    these remained fully capable of transfer even after the Sichuan earthquake. The
                    contract was therefore unaffected in any way by the damage to the Chinese
                    Business. Furthermore, although the Information Memorandum referred to the
                    Chinese Business at length, it was the NC Shares which would be transferred by
                    the sale – there was no direct purchase of the business and/or assets of
                    Norwest China. To reinforce Newport’s argument, Mr Chan stressed that
                    Norwest’s liquidator never held out to Newport or any interested purchaser
                    that the subject-matter of the sale was the business and/or assets of Norwest
                    China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     However, it seems clear to me that the
                    fundamental commercial purpose of the sale and purchase of the NC Shares is to
                    gain access to and take over the Chinese Business. If evidence is needed this
                    can be found in many aspects of the transaction. The Information Memorandum
                    referred extensively to the Chinese Business (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above), and stated that the intention of Norwest’s
                    liquidator was to sell Norwest Chemicals together with Norwest China “in
                    its present state and condition on an ‘as is, where is’
                    basis” – a qualification which would make no sense at all if the
                    subject-matter of the sale was the NC Shares by themselves. The advertisements
                    placed by the liquidator similarly describes the subject-matter as a “PRC
                    based manufacturer or phosphorous phosphate chemicals and phosphorous
                    derivatives” or alternatively, as “a Singapore company who owns a
                    phosphorous production base in Sichuan, China” (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). An Information Sheet issued by the
                    liquidator in February 2008 describes the sale as an</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">opportunity to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    Gain access to a phosphorous production base &amp;
                            its existing customers; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    Gain access to the supply of Yellow Phosphorous in
                                China.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The template Expression of Interest in the Information Memorandum
                    stated that the “Expression of Interest is made on the condition that in
                    acquiring the shares of [Norwest Chemicals], we [<em>ie</em>, the buyer] will gain 100% control of [Norwest China], a 100%
                    subsidiary owned by [Norwest Chemicals].” This was not altered when
                    Mr Cawley submitted the actual Expression of Interest on behalf of Newport
                    (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). The liquidator had himself
                    facilitated Newport’s due diligence process on Norwest China and the
                    Chinese Business, including site visits, for the purposes of determining its
                    offer price. It was clear to both parties that the $10.25m price tag eventually
                    offered by Newport was not arbitrary, a figure plucked from thin air – it
                    was determined based on Newport’s assessment of the value of the Chinese
                    Business as seen in the course of due diligence. Besides, the second Information
                    Memorandum issued by the liquidator on 29 June 2008 after the sale to
                    Newport was aborted stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In May 2008, due to an earthquake in the PRC, much of the [Production
                        Facilities have] has been damaged and operations at the [Production
                        Facilities] have ceased. As at the date of this memorandum, it is not clear
                        as to the extent of the damage caused by the earthquake and there is no
                        clear timeline for the resumption of operations at the [Production
                        Facilities]. Landslides caused by the earthquake have also blocked access to
                        the mine. Mining operations have also ceased since the occurrence of the
                        earthquake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same vein, the reconstruction needed after the damage wrought
                    by the Sichuan earthquake was listed in the second Information Memorandum as one
                    of the issues and challenges facing a buyer of the NC Shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> A second Information Sheet
                    issued in July 2008 similarly stated that “[t]he recent earthquake in PRC
                    has a significant impact on the quality of the assets in PRC and operations at
                    the plant may not resume until physical access to the mines are re-established
                    and the plants are rebuilt.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> All these aspects of the transaction
                    would be rather surreal and nonsensical if the Chinese Business was somehow not
                    essential to the transaction. It is clear, in my judgment, that the Chinese
                    Business was the true subject-matter and essence of the transaction; the NC
                    Shares had a value of $10.25m so long as they gave Newport access to and control
                    of the Chinese Business in the same state and condition as it was in at the time
                    of the 9 May Offer. In my view, Mr Chan’s contention that the
                    sale concerned the NC Shares <em>in vacuo</em>, was –
                    from a commercial and business standpoint – untenable and
                    disingenuous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Plainly, Newport’s 9 May Offer was
                    objectively aimed at gaining access to and control over the Chinese Business
                        <em>in the state and condition it was actually in at the time
                        of the offer – ie, a vertically-integrated and fully operational
                        phosphate mining, processing and production business</em>. It must not
                    be forgotten that the 9 May Offer was expressly made on the basis of
                    Newport’s “independent assessment” of the Chinese Business. Further, the Information Memorandum, which defined the whole
                    negotiation process, expressly contemplated a sale on an “as is, where
                    is” basis. Mr Taylor in cross-examination confirmed that he had seen
                    the liquidator’s letter dated 10 April 2008 and was aware that the
                    liquidator had written to say that the final offer for the NC Shares should be
                    submitted on an “as is, where is” basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Those facts were also repeatedly affirmed by
                    Norwest in evidence and in its submissions. Norwest’s liquidator
                    maintained during cross-examination that, since the negotiations and sale
                    proceeded on an “as is, where is” basis, he was not giving any
                    warranty as to the condition of the Chinese Business. This is correct, but
                    merely one side of the coin. In an “as is, where is” sale, the
                    buyer agrees to take the subject-matter “as it is” or “as
                    seen”, without warranty or guarantee as to quality, character, condition,
                    size, weight or kind (see Anandan Krishnan, <em>Words, Phrases
                        &amp; Maxims Legally and Judicially Defined</em> (Singapore:
                    LexisNexis, 2008), vol. 2 at p A1887; and <em>Mensa
                        Mercantile (Far East) Pte Ltd v Eikobina (M) Sdn Bhd</em> [1989]
                    2 MLJ 170 at 175–176). The buyer cannot ask for the
                    subject-matter to be better than it actually is, but, at the same time, and
                    crucially for this case, the buyer had not agreed to accept anything less. Put
                    in another way, it is against all commercial sense to say that an interested
                    buyer who offers to take in existing condition thereby offers to take in
                        <em>any</em> condition henceforth – an agreement
                    to take “as is” does not operate as an entire assumption of risk.
                    Absent any contrary intention, the condition which the offeror-buyer offers to
                    take is, quite naturally, the condition at the time the offer was made and not
                    the time of acceptance, which is by definition a complete and unconditional
                    agreement to the terms of the offer. Of course, it can well be argued that the
                    buyer would take subject to any change which might occur in the ordinary course
                    of events such as wear and tear, but it can hardly be doubted that the massive
                    Sichuan earthquake and the damage it caused were not events of that
                    nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Accordingly, it was entirely possible for the
                    contract between Norwest and Newport to be affected by the damage caused by the
                    Sichuan earthquake to the Chinese Business. To reiterate, the commercial essence
                    of the transaction shares was not the NC Shares <em>in
                        vacuo</em>. It was not even about <em>control per
                        se</em> over Norwest Chemicals and Norwest China. It was about the
                    object of such control: <em>ie</em>, the <em>vertically- integrated and fully operational phosphate mining, processing
                        and production business</em> that constituted the Chinese Business at
                    the time of the 9 May Offer. While Norwest’s liquidator may not have
                    held out anything, it is undeniable that this was what Norwest was selling, and
                    what Newport intended to buy. This is amply illustrated by the sale to Hwa Hong
                    for $4.5m, which demonstrated how much the Sichuan earthquake affected the value
                    of the transaction. It was, I would repeat, entirely disingenuous to argue that
                    the transaction was unaffected because the NC Shares were themselves unaffected
                    – the entire commercial value of the NC Shares (assessed by Newport at
                    $10.25m) laid in the opportunity to take over the on-going vertically-integrated
                    Chinese Business which was the true subject-matter of acquisition. After the
                    earthquake, the NC Shares did not present the same value as offered on
                    9 May 2008; the value had changed and the liquidator was not able to
                    deliver the value that was bargained for (see Mr Taylor’s evidence at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above) when Newport made the offer
                    on 9 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The damage wrought by the Sichuan earthquake to the Chinese
                Business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I turn now to examine the damage caused by the
                    Sichuan earthquake to the Chinese Business. As said, it was not disputed that at
                    2.28 pm (Singapore time) on 12 May 2008 an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the
                    Richter scale struck the Sichuan province. I have already referred to the
                    catastrophic effect of the Sichuan earthquake in general. With regard to the
                    Chinese Business, Norwest’s witness Wang Xue Bo, the general manager of
                    Hwa Hong’s Chinese operations and since 2002 the executive director of
                    Norwest China, said in his evidence-in-chief that “[t]he Production
                    Facilities and the Mines were close to the heart of the Sichuan
                        earthquake.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Evidence of the damage wrought by the
                    earthquake to the Production Facilities and the Mines were led by several
                    witnesses: Kevin Holley, Newport’s expert witness who is a geotechnical
                    engineer by profession and whose evidence was largely unchallenged;
                    Mr Argyle who visited the Production Facilities in May 2008 after the
                    Sichuan earthquake; Mr Wang, who testified on behalf on Norwest; and from
                    information contained in the first and second Information Memoranda and
                    announcements made by Norwest’s liquidator. Evidence concerning the damage
                    is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     The entrances to four out of five
                        mine shafts were sealed by rubble,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> and (at the time of
                        trial) the extraction of phosphate rock had not resumed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> After the Mines had ceased operation
                        and existing stocks were depleted, phosphate production in Mianzhu had to
                        depend on external sources of phosphate rocks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> There was some argument over
                        whether the validity of the mining licences would be extended in the
                        ordinary course of events or cut short because of the Sichuan earthquake,
                        but in the absence of conclusive proof either way, I considered that the
                        licences would be good until 2015, as they were before the
                        earthquake.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        road to the Mines, which was essentially a dirt track, became inaccessible.
                        Mr Wang’s workers were only able to access the Mines by foot in
                        March 2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> a year after the Sichuan
                        earthquake, and as of the date of trial road access to the Mines had yet to
                        be restored.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>

                        Two were damaged beyond repair – they had either collapsed or were

                        facilities, and the laboratory – were also severely
                            damaged.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     As a result of the damage, the
                        Production Facilities ceased operations for a period after the Sichuan
                        earthquake. In July 2008, the cessation of operations was announced by the
                        liquidator in an Information Sheet: “The recent earthquake in PRC
                        ha[d] a significant impact on the quality of the assets in PRC and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In particular, a comparison of the post-quake production figures for
                    2008 with the net production figures for the same year showed that production
                    levels of sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and phosphoric acid
                    in the first four months (<em>ie</em>, before the Sichuan
                    earthquake) were roughly the same as that for the next eight months (<em>ie</em>, after the Sichuan earthquake) – indicating
                    that production levels approximately halved. The decrease was even worse for
                    yellow phosphorous: the pre-earthquake months were between seven to eight times
                    more productive than the post-earthquake months. No figures were given for the
                    production of phosphate rock in the pre-quake months of 2008, but as stated the
                    production of phosphate rock ceased completely after the Sichuan earthquake
                    caused the collapse of the mine entrances and had yet to resume at the time of
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_g"></a>(g)     In addition, an unspecified number
                        of Norwest China’s employees were killed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> I note once again that Norwest
                        did not provide much primary evidence of its own of the extent of the
                        earthquake damage, but instead focussed on contesting the evidence led by
                        Newport. This was despite the fact that Norwest’s liquidator was
                        clearly in contact with Hwa Hong, the present owner of the NC Shares and
                        Mr Ong for the present litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is clear that, with the supply of phosphate
                    rock from the Mines disrupted, the Chinese Business was no longer a
                    vertically-integrated operation. The Information Memorandum indicated that
                    vertical integration was seen by Norwest’s liquidator as an important
                    selling point (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). This was also
                    why the business was attractive to Newport. In this regard, I accepted
                    Mr Argyle’s evidence that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the key operation of the [Chinese Business] that <em>it’s an integrated business</em> that can produce
                        rock and then sell it or go downstream, produce phosphorous, sell it or go
                        downstream and if they go downstream with the phosphorous, produce acid,
                        sell it or go downstream, then if they produce acid, if they keep it, it
                        would be turned in[to] sodium phosphate. <em>It’s an
                            integrated business</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I also accepted Mr Taylor’s evidence (set out at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above) that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the acquisition of [Norwest Chemicals] … presented the
                        opportunity of acquiring a phosphate mining and processing business that
                            <em>was already in operation and creating
                            revenue</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It also goes without saying that the operational nature of the Chinese
                    Business must have been at the forefront of the parties’
                minds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Mr Chan attempted to make light of the
                    US$3.04m to US$5.36m cost ($4.13m to $7.29m at the exchange rate then
                    prevailing) of repairing the damage done to the Production Facilities and by
                    extension downplay the damage itself. He compared the estimated repair cost to
                    the US$30m to US$43.8m profit which Newport estimated it could make from the
                    venture over the life of the mining licences. This is not a valid comparison at
                    all – the profitability of the Chinese Business would not be the same
                    after the Sichuan earthquake. In my judgment, the proper perspective is this:
                    before the Sichuan earthquake, Newport agreed to pay $10.25m for a fully
                    operational and integrated phosphate mining and production business. After the
                    earthquake, Newport would have had to expend an additional $4.13m to $7.29m to
                    reinstate the Production Facilities, a further unknown amount to repair the
                    Mines, and suffer the consequences of the reduced production and further
                    disruption to cash flow while the repairs were carried out. In addition,
                    Mr Argyle pointed out in cross-examination the importance in the phosphate
                    industry of having flexibility in product lines, which was affected by the loss
                    of the two furnaces. I also took note of the fact that the disrupted cash flow
                    would in all likelihood affect Norwest China’s ability to service the
                    RMB27m debt it owed to the Agricultural Bank of China. I further noted that
                    there was no evidence given at the trial (which took place more than a year
                    after the Sichuan earthquake) to show that the Production Facilities had resumed
                    pre-earthquake production levels – Mr Wang’s evidence that the
                    Production Facilities and Mines could be up and running in 2010 was an opinion
                    which he was not competent to express, and in any case was not substantiated by
                    evidence, and I accordingly did not accept it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In these circumstances, I found that as a
                    result of the Sichuan earthquake, the Chinese Business was substantially not in
                    the same state and condition it was in at the time of the 9 May Offer
                    –
                    <em>ie</em>, a vertically-integrated and fully operational
                    phosphate mining, processing and production business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Effect of the damage on the parties’ contractual
                relations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The effect of the fact that the Chinese
                    Business was substantially not in the same state and condition it was in at the
                    time of the 9 May Offer would, of course, depend on the terms of the
                    parties’ agreement. It should be remembered that the parties reached
                    substantial but not complete agreement – there was, in other words, an
                    agreement on the essentials of the transaction but not the mechanics. The court
                    would therefore have to supply the mechanics of the transaction in accordance
                    with the standard of reasonableness. On the facts, the most obvious and
                    reasonable way to structure the mechanics of the transaction would be for the
                    transfer of the NC Shares and the payment of the $10.25m price to be mutually
                    dependent conditions to be performed at the same time, such that a failure to
                    perform one would be justification for not performing the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     From the details of the damage examined at
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> to <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> above, it was clear that at no point between 12 May
                    2008 (the date of acceptance) to 1 August 2008 (the date the sale to Hwa Hong
                    was completed) was Norwest anywhere near being able to deliver the Chinese
                    Business <em>in the state and condition it was actually in at the
                        time of the offer</em>. And since Newport would not be receiving what
                    it offered to buy, it was not bound to accept the NC Shares or make
                    payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On 1 August 2008, Norwest completed the
                    transfer of the NC Shares to Hwa Hong’s nominee, ostensibly pursuant to
                    the mitigation sale with Hwa Hong which was entered into in the mistaken belief
                    that Newport had breached its contract. But, as stated, Newport was fully
                    justified in refusing to make payment. Accordingly, by its sale to Hwa Hong,
                    Norwest had in fact – by its own deliberate act – made it impossible
                    for it to perform its end of the bargain and thereby to claim the
                price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In other words, there was no point at which
                    Norwest became entitled to the $10.25m price. This is sufficient to dispose of
                    Norwest’s claim. Ironically, it was Norwest who wrongfully and totally
                    disabled itself from performing the contract by selling the NC Shares to Hwa
                    Hong. However, since Newport is not making any claim against Norwest in this
                    regard, it is not necessary for me to go beyond this observation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     To reiterate, my analysis above is based on
                    the interpretation of the term “as is, where is” in the
                    Information Memorandum – from which the 9 May Offer was taken. It is
                    also based on interpreting the fact that the 9 May Offer was made on the
                    basis of Newport’s “independent assessment of the available
                    information.” That said, I noted in my oral judgment that it would be
                    preferable to deal with the present facts using an analysis based on common
                    mistake, as opposed to Newport’s argument based on an implied condition in
                    the offer. I now go on to explain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other issues: the lapse of an offer through failure of an implied condition or by operation of law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Since I have already disposed of the claim in
                    Newport’s favour for the reasons given, there was strictly no need for me
                    to address Newport’s remaining arguments, <em>viz</em> that its 9 May Offer lapsed as a result of the failure
                    of an <em>implied condition</em> that the Chinese Business
                    was to remain in substantially the same state and condition it was in at the
                    time the offer was made, following the English Court of Appeal decision in
                        <em>Financings Ltd v Stimson</em> [1962]
                    1 WLR 1184 (“<em>Financings</em>”);
                    and, alternatively, that the 9 May Offer lapsed by the <em>operation of a rule of law</em> that an offer lapses upon a
                    fundamental change in the circumstances which formed the basis on which the
                    offer was made, following the recent New Zealand Supreme Court decision in
                        <em>Dysart Timbers Limited v Roderick William
                        Nielsen</em> [2009] NZSC 43 (“<em>Dysart Timbers</em>”). I commented on these arguments in my
                    oral judgment because they were raised by Newport’s pleadings, and because
                    the parties made detailed submissions on them. Now that Norwest has appealed
                    against my decision, it is just as well that I had earlier expressed some views
                    on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I start with the facts and holdings in
                        <em>Financings</em> and <em>Dysart
                        Timbers</em>. In <em>Financings</em>, S signed a
                    hire-purchase agreement to purchase a car from F (a finance company) for
                    £414. The hire-purchase agreement was stated to be binding on F only upon
                    it being signed on F’s behalf. Clause 1(c) of the hire-purchase agreement
                    contained an acknowledgement by S that “he ha[d] examined the goods and
                    satisfied himself that they were in good order and condition.” Clause 2
                    provided that S’s “acceptance of the goods shall be conclusive that
                    he has examined the goods and satisfied himself that they were in good order and
                    condition.” On the night of March 24/25, the car was stolen and damaged.
                    On March 25, F signed the hire-purchase agreement. The car was subsequently
                    recovered and sold for £224, and F brought an action to recover the
                    difference between the price of the car less £224. There was an issue of
                    ostensible authority but it is not germane to the present case. It is not clear
                    from the judgments or the report whether F knew about the damage sustained by
                    the car when it signed the agreement. The relevant part of the judgment
                    concerned the effect of the damage to the car on S’s offer. In this
                    regard, Lord Denning MR held (at 1189):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Can a man accept an offer when the condition of the goods has deteriorated
                        in a material respect since the date of the offer?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that, on the facts of this case, the offer made by the
                        hirer was a conditional offer. It was conditional on the car remaining in
                        substantially the same condition until the moment of acceptance. Take the
                        case put by my brother Donovan in the course of the argument: suppose an
                        offer is made to buy a Rolls Royce car at a high price on one day and before
                        it is accepted, it suffers the next day severe damage. Can it be accepted
                        and the offeror bound? My answer to that is: no, because the offer is
                        conditional on the goods at the moment of acceptance remaining in
                        substantially the same condition as at the time of the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Rawley [Counsel for F] argued before us that there was an express
                        clause here saying that the goods were to be "at the risk of the hirer from
                        the time of purchase by the owner." The time of purchase by the owner, he
                        said, was March 18, when the finance company told the dealer orally that
                        they accepted the transaction. Thenceforward, he said, the goods were at the
                        risk of the hirer. This shows, says Mr Rawley, that the condition which
                        I have suggested is inconsistent with the express terms, or, at all events,
                        is not to be implied. In my judgment, however, this clause on which Mr.
                        Rawley relies only comes into operation when a contract is concluded and
                        accepted. Meanwhile the offer is made on the understanding that, so long as
                        it remains an offer, it is conditional on the goods being in substantially
                        the same condition as at the time when the offer was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I agree, therefore, with the County Court Judge in thinking that, in view
                        of the damage which occurred to this car before the acceptance was given,
                        the finance company were not in a position to accept the offer, because the
                        condition on which it was made had not been fulfilled. So on that ground
                        also there was no contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Donovan LJ held (at 1190–1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But if this view be wrong I would agree that the offer here was on the
                        basis that the car remained substantially in the same condition until
                        acceptance, and this did not happen. I do not regard clause 2 of the terms
                        of the printed hire-purchase agreement as incorporated in the offer. Who
                        would offer to purchase a car on terms that if it were severely damaged
                        before the offer was accepted, he, the offeror, would pay the bill? The
                        suggestion seems to me to be quite unreal. I think that the offer is
                        conditioned, in a case where the documents are in the form which they take
                        here, by the clause which the offeror signs to the effect that he has
                        examined the goods and satisfied himself that they are in good order and
                        condition. What is the point of this provision if, before acceptance, the
                        goods are heavily damaged but nevertheless the offeror can still be
                        compelled to buy them. The county court judge held that there must,
                        therefore, be implied a term that until acceptance the goods would remain in
                        substantially the same state as at the date of the offer; and I think this
                        is both good sense and good law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Pearson LJ held (at 1193–4):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I do agree that the offer was conditional. It is not
                        necessary for the purpose of this case to lay down any broad general
                        propositions as to what happens when there is a change in the condition of
                        the goods between the date of offer and the date of acceptance, because we
                        have important special features in this case. This was a hire-purchase
                        transaction and the offer which was signed by the proposed hire purchaser on
                        March 16 contained this provision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">"In signing this agreement the hirer acknowledges that before he
                            signed it - (<em>c</em>) he had examined the goods
                            and satisfied himself that they were in good order and
                            condition."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That is something which has to be signed by the offeror. What is the
                        meaning of it and what must one infer in order to give reasonable business
                        efficacy to this transaction? The obvious intention is this, that both the
                        hire purchaser and the finance company will be able to rely on the condition
                        of the car as it appears to the proposed hire purchaser when he makes his
                        offer, and it is on the basis of the car being in that condition that
                        various figures, which one finds on the same page, must have been
                        assessed.</p>

<em>Financings</em> was interpreted by the

                    the very fair and rational proposition that in every offer, absent evidence to

                    date of acceptance, will be in substantially the same condition as it was when
                    the offer was made.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The facts in <em>Dysart
                        Timbers</em> were rather more unique. DT had obtained judgment against
                    N for about $300,000 in the New Zealand Court of Appeal. N applied for leave to
                    appeal to the New Zealand Supreme Court. Three days after both DT and N had
                    filed their submissions on the leave application, N’s solicitor made an
                    offer to DT’s solicitor to settle at $250,000. The offer was made at 9.23
                    am. At 12.30 pm on the same day, the Registrar of the Supreme Court advised both
                    DT and N that leave to appeal had been granted. At 1.12 pm, DT purported to
                    accept the offer. N argued that the offer to settle was impliedly conditional
                    upon the leave application being unresolved and, therefore, the offer lapsed
                    when leave was granted. The New Zealand Supreme Court was spilt 3-2 on the
                    proper approach to be taken. Tipping and Wilson JJ (whose joint judgment
                    was delivered by Tipping J) elaborated on what they considered to be the proper
                    approach as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[25]  An offer is a statement of the terms upon which
                            the offeror is prepared to be bound if acceptance is communicated while
                            the offer remains alive. It is a unilateral statement and, in that
                            respect, is to be distinguished from the bilateral nature of the
                            contract which comes into existence upon the acceptance of the offer.
                            The distinction is relevant to the basis upon which terms may be implied
                            into the offer. When there is a suggestion a term should be implied in
                            the case of a bilateral transaction, the question is what a reasonable
                            person would consider both parties must have meant to happen in
                            circumstances not expressly addressed by the contract. The conventional
                            concepts (officious bystander and business efficacy) are built on that
                            underlying premise. In the case of a unilateral transaction, such as an
                            offer to contract, the focus should be on what the then sole party to
                            the transaction, the offeror, meant to happen. This approach to offers
                            is consistent with principle and is supported by leading American
                            textbooks on the law of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[26]  What the offeror meant to happen must be
                            objectively assessed. Whether it is appropriate to infer that the offer
                            was meant to lapse in the events which have occurred will depend on the
                            terms of the offer itself and all the relevant circumstances in which it
                            was made. If an offer is made on a particular factual basis or
                            assumption the Court may be justified in finding an implied condition
                            that the offer will lapse should that basis or assumption cease to
                            apply. But that finding should be made only if the continued existence
                            of the factual basis or assumption was fundamental to the making of the
                            offer or to its terms; otherwise it cannot be said to be inherent in the
                            terms of the offer. Put more generally, a condition that an offer lapse
                            upon the occurrence of a particular change of circumstances should be
                            implied into the offer only if it is objectively apparent that the
                            willingness of the offeror to be bound by the offer has been
                            fundamentally undermined by the change of circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[27]  In the result the condition which is implied is
                            that the offer will lapse upon the occurrence of a fundamental change of
                            circumstances. Recognising that a change of circumstances of this
                            fundamental kind is necessary before an offer lapses will ensure that
                            lapse on this basis will be a relatively rare occurrence. This is an
                            appropriate way to reconcile the interests of offerors and offerees and
                            to avoid the considerable uncertainty that would result from the test
                            being at a lower level.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[28]  An offeree cannot reasonably expect to be able to
                            accept an offer if the basis on which it was made has fundamentally
                            changed. Conversely an offeror must ordinarily be expected to provide
                            expressly for the circumstances in which the offer will lapse. The need
                            for there to be a fundamental change in circumstances before an offer
                            will lapse gives appropriate weight to the interests of both offerors
                            and offerees. The reasonable expectations of both parties are thereby
                            accommodated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[29]  In the present case Dysart was aware of the facts
                            constituting the change before it purported to accept the offer. We are
                            not therefore called on to decide whether an offeree’s ignorance
                            of the change should affect the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     With regards to the degree of change needed to
                    trigger the lapse of an offer, Tipping and Wilson JJ drew an analogy to
                    frustration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[30]  There is some similarity between the approach
                            just outlined and that taken at common law to the question of
                            frustration of contracts …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[31]  … Provided the unilateral nature of an
                            offer is recognised, the frustration analogy provides useful guidance
                            for the kind of basis upon which a condition providing for lapse upon a
                            change of circumstances may be implied into an offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[32]  The present significance of an offer being a
                            unilateral transaction is that whereas concluded contracts generally
                            allocate risks between the parties, an offer does not do so. Liability
                            for breach of contract does not usually depend on fault. Performance is
                            not excused by changes in circumstances. Hence traditionally a very high
                            threshold was required for frustration, going as it does to discharge
                            rather than to formation of the contract. Although there is conceptual
                            similarity between frustration and implied lapse of an offer, the
                            differences between the two are such that it is not appropriate to apply
                            the full rigour of frustration principles to the lapsing of offers,
                            albeit the test must still be at a high level.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     On the facts, Tipping and Wilson JJ
                    considered that the grant of leave constituted a fundamental change of
                    circumstances that caused the offer to settle to lapse. The approach taken by
                    Tipping and Wilson JJ was not accepted by McGrath J. He rejected what
                    he called the “rule of law” approach, and preferred instead what
                    he called the “construction” approach, which, according to
                    him:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[51]  … often looks at whether the Court should
                            imply into the offer a condition as to the continuing factual position
                            between offer and acceptance. Such a condition will be a condition
                            precedent which, if not satisfied, will prevent an act of
                            “acceptance” from concluding a binding agreement. On the
                            other hand, if the condition is fulfilled, on acceptance a contract
                            comes into existence and the parties are bound.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[61]  … A test based on contractual construction
                            can take a number of forms, as the cases already discussed make plain.
                            It offers more flexibility than does the rule of law approach in that
                            respect. That flexibility is also appropriately circumscribed by the
                            overriding principles of contract interpretation. The fundamental
                            question on a contractual construction analysis will be whether, having
                            regard to the terms of the offer, the change of circumstances, and the
                            subsequent “acceptance”, viewed as a whole and
                            objectively, there is a concluded agreement. The Court’s ultimate
                            task under this approach is to ascertain whether a reasonable person in
                            Dysart’s position, knowing as its solicitors did of the change in
                            circumstances, would believe the offer was still open for acceptance.
                            This is a test which ultimately will turn on whether the
                            “acceptance” produced a common contractual intention that
                            can readily be determined by applying rules of contractual
                            construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[62]  Seen in this light, a contractual construction
                            approach is conceptually preferable in the present case. That is
                            conveniently addressed as in <em>Stimson</em> by
                            considering whether the offer was subject to an implied term. The
                            question of whether a term should be implied into a contract is an
                            exercise in contractual construction which commonly arises when a
                            contractual instrument does not expressly provide for what is to happen
                            if an event occurs. It should, however, be borne in mind that, as the
                            Privy Council has recently pointed out, the most usual inference in such
                            a case is that nothing is to happen, because if the parties had intended
                            otherwise the instrument would have said so, and the express provisions
                            are to continue undisturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[63]  The legal approach to implication of terms into
                            contracts is readily applicable to offers to enter into contractual
                            relations. I accept, however, that there is a need for the court to be
                            careful in framing the proposed implied term. The formulation could be
                            in specific and narrow, or general and broad terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Elias CJ and Blanchard J (whose
                    joint judgment was delivered by Blanchard J) preferred the approach taken by
                    Tipping and Wilson JJ:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[2]    It is open to someone who makes an offer to
                            stipulate the circumstances in which it will lapse. If the offeror does
                            not do so expressly, it may nonetheless be apparent to an objective
                            observer that the offer was made on the basis of the existence of
                            certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[3]    It is not, of course, every change in
                            circumstances which will cause the offer to lapse, i.e. make it no
                            longer open for acceptance. A rule as wide as that would be productive
                            of great uncertainty for offerees and, indeed, for offerors. Case law,
                            as Tipping J demonstrates, has always required a change which an
                            objective observer will see as very considerable in its consequences for
                            the offeror.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[4]    We are of the view that, in the absence of an
                            express term in the offer, the level of change of circumstance which is
                            required for it to lapse is that of a fundamental change, which may
                            occur all at once or by gradual development. An offeree cannot
                            reasonably expect to accept an offer if the basis on which it was made
                            has fundamentally changed. Furthermore, because it was possible for the
                            offeror to specify the events in which the offer would lapse and,
                            normally, to revoke the offer at any time without having to give a
                            reason, in determining what must be taken to be, or amount to, a
                            fundamental change the Court should give less weight to the occurrence
                            of any event which an offeror must have had in contemplation when making
                            the offer, and about which the offeror chose to be silent. That silence
                            when the offer was made, or when it could have been revoked, may
                            indicate that the offeror did not regard such a matter as fundamental to
                            the continuance of the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[5]    We do not adopt the contractual construction
                            approach which McGrath J suggests. We consider that the analogy
                            with a bilateral relationship is likely to distract attention from the
                            real task of the Court, which is to examine the unilateral action of the
                            making of the offer against the circumstances in which it was made. It
                            is the objective intention of the unilateral actor which is the proper
                            focus. The intention of the offeree in purporting to make an acceptance
                            is irrelevant. To introduce the notion of a condition precedent to
                            acceptance would also add an unhelpful complication. Nor do we consider
                            that the suggested test of whether the “acceptance”
                            produced a common contractual intention can, as McGrath J believes,
                            be deduced by applying rules of construction concerning implied
                            contractual terms. It is surely more straightforward simply to ask
                            whether, objectively, there has been a fundamental change in the
                            circumstances pertaining when the offer was put forward and therefore in
                            the consequences of an acceptance for the offeror.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Interestingly, while Elias CJ and
                    Blanchard J agreed with Tipping and Wilson JJ on the approach to be
                    taken, they disagreed on its application to the facts. Essentially Elias CJ
                    and Blanchard J placed reliance on the fact that N, in making the offer to
                    settle, must have known that the New Zealand Supreme Court might grant or refuse
                    leave to appeal before the offer was accepted. Yet N did not expressly provide
                    for this contingency (see <em>Dysart Timbers</em> at [7]).
                    This indicated to Elias CJ and Blanchard J that the grant (or refusal)
                    of leave was not fundamental to the offer to settle. A similar view was taken by
                    McGrath J (see <em>Dysart Timbers</em> at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> above). In the result, a majority of three
                    judges comprising Elias CJ and Blanchard and McGrath JJ held that the
                    offer did not lapse and was validly accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In my view, both <em>Financings</em> and <em>Dysart Timbers</em> are,
                    strictly speaking, not applicable here as they are clearly distinguishable on
                    the facts. <em>Financings</em> was based on the implication
                    of a condition into the offer that the subject-matter of the offer must remain
                    in substantially the same condition it was in at the time of the offer, failing
                    which the offer lapses. The implication of such a condition governing the lapse
                    of the offer could be said to be necessary on the facts of <em>Financings</em>, where the offeror would be precluded from raising
                    any objection to the quality of the subject-matter of the offer once the offer
                    was accepted, by virtue of a term in the proposed contract which would take
                    effect upon the formation of the contract. By contrast, the parties here had
                    already made provision for the risk of any damage or change to the Chinese
                    Business. As stated above, Newport only offered to buy the Chinese Business in
                    its state and condition as at the date of the offer, <em>ie</em>, 9 May 2008. In the circumstances, it would be <em>redundant</em>, and therefore <em>not
                        necessary</em> for the business efficacy of the offer, to further
                    imply a condition that the Chinese Business was to remain until acceptance in
                    substantially the same condition as it was in at the time the offer was
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     
          <em>Dysart Timbers</em>,
                    for its part, was based on a situation where both the offeror and offeree were
                    aware of the change of circumstances: Tipping and Wilson JJ expressly
                    stated (<em>Dysart Timbers</em> at [29], quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above) that they were not called
                    upon to decide whether the offeree’s ignorance of the change should affect
                    the issue. This is in contrast to the present facts – as stated, the
                    liquidator’s evidence was that he did not know of the Sichuan earthquake
                    at the time he accepted the 9 May Offer. Mr Ang did not cross-examine
                    him on this point and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, there was
                    no basis for a finding that the liquidator knew or ought to have known about the
                    Sichuan earthquake at the time he accepted Newport’s offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the same connection, while I accept the
                    result in both <em>Financings</em> and <em>Dysart Timbers</em> to be fair and commonsensical on their respective
                    facts, an extension of either approach to the present case is not entirely
                    consistent with the predominantly objective approach to offer and acceptance. As
                    I have just mentioned, the offeree in the present case (<em>ie</em>, Norwest’s liquidator) did not know about the change in
                    circumstances (<em>ie</em>, the Sichuan earthquake and the
                    consequent damage to the Chinese Business). Nor had the liquidator, on the
                    evidence, come to know of any facts which suggested the change in circumstances
                    such that it could be said that he ought to have known of the change in
                    circumstances. As far as the liquidator was concerned, nothing had changed since
                    the time the offer was first extended to Norwest, apparently unconditionally,
                    for acceptance. (The only express condition was the 45 day time limit for
                    accepting the offer, which is irrelevant here.) To say that in such
                    circumstances the offer had lapsed, whether through the failure of an implied
                    condition or the operation of a rule of law, would considerably undermine an
                    offeree’s ability to rely on the objectively ascertained apparent
                    intention of the offeror.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     With regard to <em>Financings</em> particularly, it is doubtful that the implied term
                    approach taken in that case provides a satisfactory juristic basis on which to
                    approach the formation problems such as the present for several reasons. First,
                    an implied term – and specifically an implied condition – is not
                    something which the parties had in their actual contemplation. Here it must be
                    pointed out that, while parties may have dealt with reference to a certain state
                    of affairs, they might not necessarily have considered that that state of
                    affairs might change, let alone provided for what would happen if the change did
                    happen. So in this regard an implied term is an artificial solution to
                    unanticipated changes of circumstances, and, for the same reason, has fallen out
                    of favour as the juristic basis for both common mistake and frustration (see
                        <em>Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage
                        (International) Ltd</em> [2003] 1 QB 679 (“<em>Great Peace</em>”) at [73]; and <em>National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd</em> [1981]
                    1 AC 675 (<em>“National Carriers v
                        Panalpina</em>”) at 687–688 <em>per</em> Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC, at 700 <em>per</em> Lord Simon of Glaisdale, and at 717 <em>per</em> Lord Roskill). Second, the implied term approach is
                    necessarily focused on the offeror’s intention at the time of the offer,
                    and on the parties’ intentions at the time of contract. Subsequent actions
                    are only relevant to the extent that they reflect or evince the relevant
                    original intention. Such an approach is appropriate in the case of a contract,
                    where the parties’ obligations are fully formed at the time of the
                    contract and cannot be unilaterally changed thereafter. It would not be
                    appropriate in the case of an offer, which can be unilaterally changed or
                    withdrawn at any time before it is accepted. What the offeror knows and does in
                    the meantime would therefore be relevant in its own right, and not merely as
                    evidence of his intention at the time of the offer. Third – and this ties
                    in with the first reason – the formulation of the precise term to be
                    implied is also likely to be fraught with artificiality and indeed
                    arbitrariness. There can be no rational way to choose between a variety of ways
                    which the risk of a change of circumstances could be provided for. For example,
                    on the present facts, an implied term concerning the condition of the Chinese
                    Business could have taken the form of an implied condition to the offer, as
                    Mr Ang urged; or, it could have taken the form of a term of the contract
                    itself (such as a condition precedent to completion). A failure of the implied
                    term will prevent a contract from arising in the first situation but not in the
                    second, and there seems to be no rational way to choose between the two. Fourth,
                    as evident from the first three points, I do not think that the law on implied
                    terms was designed to be applied to formation problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In my judgment, the usual objective approach
                    to offer and acceptance, or the doctrine of common mistake, is more than
                    adequate to provide a principled approach to changes in circumstances occurring
                    after an offer was made and before the offer is purported to be accepted. If the
                    change of circumstances is known to the parties, it becomes part of the context
                    in which they deal with each other, and the question then is whether the
                    offeror’s original intention to make an offer had, on an objective view,
                    changed in light of the change of circumstances. If, as here, the change is
                    unknown to the parties, then the doctrine of common mistake should apply,
                    subject to its other requirements being met. In my view, the doctrine strikes an
                    appropriate balance between the interests of the offeror and offeree: it applies
                    only to a <em>common</em> mistake as to something which was
                    the <em>common</em> basis of the parties’ agreement.
                    The doctrine, which results in a <em>void contract</em>, is
                    also conceptually sound. It recognises, on the one hand, that there may be a
                    factual meeting of minds when parties dealt with each other while under a common
                    mistake, including a common ignorance about a change of circumstances which
                    falsified the parties’ initial beliefs. On the other hand, it holds that,
                    when the common mistake is such that it fundamentally alters the basis on which
                    the parties dealt, and when no party had expressly or impliedly assumed the risk
                    of the mistake, the parties ought to be relieved by operation of law from the
                    contract which would otherwise result. For the avoidance of doubt, I should
                    state here that, while Newport disavowed the common mistake point, it was
                    possible, on the facts, for me to decide the case on an alternative basis,
                        <em>ie</em>, that even if the contract between the
                    parties was not void for common mistake, Newport was nevertheless justified in
                        <em>not</em> completing the purchase of the NC Shares
                    because Norwest was unable to deliver its end of the bargain (see <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above). Needless to say, this will not be a point that can
                    be taken in every case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The result in <em>Financings</em> and <em>Dysart Timbers</em>
                    could have been reached on the basis of the respective rationale adopted. In
                        <em>Financings</em>, both parties were ignorant of the
                    damage to the car and could be said to have dealt with each other in the common
                    mistake that the car was in good condition. This rationalisation was advanced by
                    Professor PS Atiyah (“Judicial Techniques and Contract Law” in
                        <em>Essays on Contract</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
                    1986) at pp 250 – 251), though he also took the view – which is not
                    open to me to take – that there should be no doctrine of common mistake.
                    In <em>Dysart Timbers</em>, N must have made the offer to
                    settle in the knowledge that leave to appeal may be granted at any time, a fact
                    which must also have been apparent to DT. In failing to make express provision
                    for the possibility that leave might be granted, N would objectively appear to
                    be indifferent to the grant of leave or, in other words, to have assumed the
                    risk of leave being granted. Therefore, when leave was in fact granted, N was
                    precluded both from raising common mistake (which would have been precluded also
                    because DT was not in fact mistaken when it accepted the offer), and also from
                    arguing that objectively he did not intend for the offer to settle to be capable
                    of acceptance if leave was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It was therefore not necessary, in my
                    respectful view, for the learned judges in <em>Financings</em> and <em>Dysart Timbers</em> to
                    resort to the implied term and rule of law approaches respectively. In
                    particular, I would observe that the approach advocated by the <em>Dysart Timbers</em> majority, focussing as it did on the
                    objective willingness of the offeror to stand by the offer in the changed
                    circumstances (see <em>per</em> Tipping and Wilson JJ
                    at [26], and <em>per</em> Elias CJ and
                    Blanchard J at [4]), is not that much different from the usual approach to
                    offer and acceptance. The analogy with frustration is especially unhelpful.
                    There is a vital distinction between frustration and offer situations – in
                    a frustration situation, the parties are in a binding contractual relationship
                    from which they cannot unilaterally withdraw; in an offer situation, the offeror
                    is always free to withdraw or modify his offer. In <em>Dysart
                        Timbers</em>, Wilson and Tipping JJ seemed to have acknowledged
                    this distinction (at [30] – [31]), but thought that it only went to the
                    magnitude of the change required for an offer to lapse, which they set at a
                    lower level than that required for frustration. However, I think that the
                    distinction results in a more important practical difference. Whether a contract
                    is frustrated is entirely a question of law and as Lord Roskill said in
                        <em>National Carriers v Panalpina</em> ([71] above at
                    712), its operation does not depend on the action or inaction of the parties
                    after the frustrating event. On the other hand, whether an offer has objectively
                    lapsed or become mistaken is something which is and ought to be sensitive to
                    whether the offeror actually or ostensibly knew about the change of
                    circumstances, and what he did if he knew – in particular, whether he took
                    steps to withdraw or suspend the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Finally, I was referred by Mr Chan to the
                    Court of Appeal’s counsel of caution with regard to the implication of
                    terms in law in <em>Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities</em>
                    [2009] 3 SLR(R) 518 at [56], and noted in this regard that the width
                    of the approaches enunciated in <em>Financings</em> (as
                    interpreted in <em>Clark Agri Service</em>, quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above) and <em>Dysart Timbers</em> are comparable to the implication of a term in
                    law. It also seemed to me, for the reasons given above, that adopting an overly
                    expansive approach to the lapse of offers would have the effect of undermining
                    the objective approach to offer and acceptance, as well as the doctrine of
                    common mistake. For these reasons, I would have declined to follow both
                        <em>Financings</em> and <em>Dysart
                        Timbers</em>, had it been necessary for me to decide the point. For
                    the same reasons, I would have approached the issues in this case from the
                    alternative perspective of common mistake, had Mr Ang not disavowed the
                    point. Here, I would make the comment that Mr Ang’s opinion that
                    common mistake is inapplicable after the offer is made does not seem to be
                    supported by the authorities, which seem only to require that the relevant
                    contract be <em>formed</em> in common mistake, <em>ie</em>, that it is sufficient that the parties become
                    mistaken by the time of acceptance. It also results in a most curious situation
                    in the interval between offer and acceptance, where common mistake has ceased
                    (in Mr Ang’s view) to apply, and where frustration has not yet begun
                    to apply. However, since I have in any case decided in favour of Newport, it is
                    not necessary for me to go into further detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Newport’s counterclaim for the deposit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Since Norwest did not perform its end of the
                    bargain at all, Newport would be able to recover the $102,500 deposit it placed
                    with Norwest for total failure of consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     For these reasons, I dismissed Norwest’s claim and granted judgment for $102,500 on Newport’s counterclaim. I also ordered that Newport would be entitled to its costs both in the main action and the counterclaim – these to be agreed or taxed.</p>
