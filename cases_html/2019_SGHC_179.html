<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Agreed statement of facts (“ASOF”) at S/N 1.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The first to fourth plaintiffs (“the Plaintiffs”) are the Deceased’s siblings. They did not attend the wedding and were completely unaware of the Marriage. The Deceased’s sudden death from a heart attack in 2017 came as a shock to the Plaintiffs. They received another shock when the Defendant turned up at the Deceased’s funeral wake and claimed to be his wife. The Plaintiffs had known the Deceased to be a bachelor before his demise. In this action the Plaintiffs seek the following reliefs:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) firstly, a declaration that the Marriage was a sham marriage or marriage of convenience (“the First Declaration”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) secondly, a declaration that the Deceased’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) moneys and all his other assets are to be distributed among the Deceased’s immediate family according to the prevailing laws, rules and regulations to the exclusion of the Defendant (“the Second Declaration”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The First Declaration requires the court to determine whether the Marriage was a sham marriage. This is a question of fact. The Second Declaration raises important legal issues, such as whether a sham marriage is a valid or void marriage under the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) and whether a party to a sham marriage is a “surviving spouse” under s 7 of the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed) (“ISA”) and a “wife” under s 73 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”). These provisions are relevant in determining whether the Defendant is entitled to the Deceased’s estate (under the ISA), CPF moneys (under the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36, 2013 Rev Ed) (“CPF Act”)) and life insurance proceeds (under the CLPA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the outset, the terminology used in this judgment ought to be clarified. The term sham marriage is not a term of art (<span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng v Huang Huiqun </span>[2011] 1 SLR 737 (“<span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng</span>”) at [17]). A sham marriage is a general term which may refer to any marriage where the parties do not genuinely intend to live as man and wife for whatever reason (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a marriage to further the parties’ business interests or to please their respective parents). However, the present case is <span class="font-italic">not </span>concerned with sham marriages in all its guises and forms, but only with a <span class="font-italic">specific </span><span class="font-italic">sub-species</span> that corresponds with the definition of a marriage of convenience under s 11A of the Women’s Charter, with the following elements:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the purpose of the marriage is to assist one party to obtain an immigration advantage (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the grant of permanent residence (“PR”) under the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Immigration Act”));</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there is gratification given, offered, or received as an inducement or reward to the other party; and</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the parties did not intend for the marriage to result in a genuine marital relationship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I shall refer to a sham marriage with the above elements as an “immigration-advantage sham marriage”. For short, I shall also refer to element (c) above in terms of whether the marriage was a “genuine marriage”, and references to whether a marriage was a genuine one should be read accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I shall now refer to the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Brief background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Deceased was a Singapore citizen.

Alternatively, (iii) these statements should be given minimal weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I shall deal with points (i) and (ii) together. I do not accept either argument. It is not disputed that the notice requirements were not complied with.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>But even when the notice requirements in O 38 r 4 of the ROC are not complied with, the court may exercise its discretion under O 2 r 1 to cure such non-compliance where the failure to give notice did not cause prejudice to the opposing party rendering it unfair for the hearsay evidence to be admitted: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2019</span> vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2019)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 38/4/3.

These include serving a notice in writing to inform the other parties of his intention to introduce the evidence contained in the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) of the witness through whom the statement is to be admitted, which must state the grounds under s 32(1) of the Evidence Act that are relied on and give details about the circumstances in which non-documentary statements were made (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the time and place of making the statement, the name and address of the person who heard the statement, and the substance or actual words used). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Plaintiffs contend that they have in substance complied with O 38 r 4 because all the requisite details could be found in the affidavits of PW2, PW3 and PW4. Unfortunately, the requisite details are inadequate as the affidavits did not state, amongst others, the time and place of making the statement. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, what the Plaintiffs did or did not do must be seen against the fact that objections were not filed. The Plaintiffs’ counsel pointed out that at the pre-trial conference of 14 February 2019, parties were directed to exchange affidavits by 25 February 2019 and objections were to be raised by 4 March 2019. The Defendant’s counsel accepted that she had not filed a notice of objections, even though a party is obligated to file a notice of objections stating all grounds of objections under para 62 of the Supreme Court Practice Directions. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Furthermore, it is relevant to my determination that no prejudice was caused to the Defendant arising from the Plaintiffs’ lack of notice. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [138], citing Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The more difficult question is when and under what circumstances should a court exercise its discretion to cure such non-compliance. It seems to us that this is ultimately a question much dependant on the extent to which the non-compliance causes prejudice to the opposing party which would render it unfair for the hearsay evidence to be admitted. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Pinsler</span> (at para 6.042): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The purpose of notice is to enable the opposing party to carry out his own investigation prior to the trial in order to ascertain its significance and veracity and to secure information which may refute it or reduce its weight (if necessary).

</div> The Deceased also told PW4 that he was planning to undergo a divorce in due course. Subsequently, PW4 formed the impression from the Deceased’s communications with her that he had become divorced. The Deceased did not mention a wife in their later conversations after 2007. In fact, around one or two years before his demise in 2017, the Deceased had informed PW4 about his intention for his estate to be divided among his siblings, nieces and nephews. There was again no mention of a wife.

Instead of living in the Potong Pasir flat with the Defendant and her younger son, the Deceased chose to rent out the Potong Pasir flat. The Defendant testified that there were eight people living in DW2’s flat, which had four bedrooms. This would have made DW2’s flat fairly crowded, as pointed out by DW3,

</div> This explanation is contrived. If the Deceased had, indeed, stayed over at DW2’s flat with the Defendant regularly, then he could have easily helped to read her letters at DW2’s flat. In all probability, the Whampoa flat was reflected as the Defendant’s address on her NRIC to maintain the façade of a genuine marriage and to deceive the authorities into granting PR status to the Defendant. Interestingly, when asked in cross-examination whether it was misleading to the authorities to give the impression she was living there, the Defendant’s reply was that it was a “very strange question” that she did not wish to and did not know how to answer.

The inference that could be drawn, on a balance of probabilities, is that the Deceased did not contribute financially to the Defendant who had to care for and financially support her younger son studying in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Subsequently, when the Deceased faced financial difficulties and eventually became a bankrupt, there was also no evidence that the Defendant helped to ease his financial woes.

She had only made two trips to Singapore thereafter: once in 2014 to renew her PR status and once more in 2017 to attend his funeral.

For this reason, I reject the Defendant’s argument that s 11A(2) of the Women’s Charter applies in this case. This provision deals with marriages where both parties to the marriage believed on reasonable grounds when contracting or entering into the sham marriage that the marriage would result in a genuine marital relationship. There is no evidence to that effect for the Marriage. Nor did the Marriage evolve into a genuine marital relationship at any point afterwards. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Defendant submits, relying on <span class="font-italic">Tan Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and others </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 at [10]–[15], that while the standard of proof in a civil case where fraud is alleged is still based on a balance of probabilities, the more serious the allegation, the more the party on whose shoulders the burden of proof falls needs to do to establish his case.

Before I start my analysis with the relevant provisions of the Women’s Charter, I would like to deal briefly with the Plaintiffs’ arguments that the principles of illegality in contract law are applicable to the contract of marriage. The Plaintiffs rely on <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another </span>[2018] 1 SLR 363 and argue that marriages should be analysed as contracts and subjected to the usual contractual principles regarding statutory and common law illegality. I disagree. The concept of illegality applicable to commercial contracts cannot be transplanted to the context of marriage as all aspects regarding the contract of marriages are dealt with under the Women’s Charter. Moreover, that approach is too simplistic considering that a marriage is more than a contract. Marriage embodies concepts of love, the union of different genders, procreation, life, morality and institutional facets (see <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng </span>at [11]).

The legal test to determine a sham marriage, which was <span class="font-italic">first </span>set out in s 57C(1) of the Immigration Act, is in substance exactly the same as that in s 11A(1) of the Women’s Charter. Parliament was also under the understanding that s 11A of the Women’s Charter would <span class="font-italic">only</span> operate once a party to the marriage had been convicted under s 57C of the Immigration Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Therefore, there is a close nexus between s 11A of the Women’s Charter and s 57C of the Immigration Act. Critically, s 57C of the Immigration Act is a penal provision and cannot apply retrospectively. Retrospective criminal laws are unconstitutional under Art 11(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) which protects against retrospective criminal laws. With this background in mind, one can then understand why s 11A of the Women’s Charter does not have retrospective effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 However, I am unable to accept the proposition that just because s 11A of the Women’s Charter only applies to marriages solemnised on or after 1 October 2016, this means that all immigration-advantage sham marriages solemnised before then were valid. By introducing s 11A of the Women’s Charter, the legislature made clear that such sham marriages entered into from 1 October 2016 are <span class="font-italic">in</span>valid. Did the legislature intend <span class="font-italic">to validate</span> such marriages simply because they occurred before this date? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 To answer this question, it is necessary to derive the intention of Parliament regarding immigration-advantage sham marriages prior to 2012. I shall refer to this issue in the context of three relevant High Court decisions that have touched on the issue. In chronological order, these are <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee</span>, <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>All three decisions were decided before s 11A of the Women’s Charter was introduced. In the case of <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Ah Thee </span>and <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng</span>, these two decisions were also decided before s 57C of the Immigration Act was introduced. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The relevant case law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee</span>, the two plaintiffs were the deceased’s children from his first marriage. They were also the administrators of the deceased’s estate. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that there was no valid marriage between the deceased and the defendant whom the deceased married in 1996 (“the second marriage”) after his first wife passed away in 1994. It transpired that the deceased  had an extramarital relationship with the defendant much earlier, around 1952, which resulted in the defendant bearing a child. But by the time of the second marriage in 1996, the deceased was 81 years old, wheelchair-bound and suffering from Parkinson’s disease. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiffs argued, amongst other things, that the marriage was void because it was “a sham marriage against public policy as the defendant’s sole or predominant motive in registering the marriage was to revoke the deceased’s will”, made before the second marriage (<span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>at [10]) The plaintiffs contended that the grounds provided for in s 105 of the Women’s Charter were not exhaustive of the grounds on which a marriage may be found void. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Judith Prakash J (as she then was) rejected the plaintiffs’ contention that the marriage was void for being a sham marriage. Prakash J reasoned that s 105 of the Women’s Charter is an “all exhaustive provision” and marriages celebrated in Singapore could not be declared void on any ground other than those provided for in s 105 (at [35]). In holding that the second marriage was valid, Prakash J added at [56]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the law desists from identifying what are the “proper” motives of marriage and does not allow the parties’ private motives to undermine the validity of the marriage. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 However, it ought to be emphasised that while the second marriage in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>was characterised by the plaintiffs as a “sham marriage”, the facts differ materially from the type of sham marriage that this case is concerned with (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, immigration-advantage sham marriages). In <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee</span>, the deceased and the defendant had a genuine romantic relationship and the couple even had a son. There was no allegation that the couple had defrauded or deceived the Registrar of Marriages into issuing them a valid marriage licence. There was also no allegation that the parties had contravened any laws in the process of getting married. Furthermore, while the plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>had alleged that the marriage contravened public policy, this public policy was not clearly identified and articulated. In the circumstances, the facts of <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>are wholly distinguishable from this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I accept the propositions stated by Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee</span>, namely, that s 105 of the Women’s Charter is an “all exhaustive provision”. But it is worth pointing out that <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>did not consider the situation where a marriage licence issued by the Registrar of Marriages was procured by the parties’ fraud and deception, and where the primary purpose of the marriage was never to live as husband and wife but only to perpetuate criminal acts and contravene existing laws. If such a marriage can be caught under one of the grounds in s 105 of the Women’s Charter (which is indeed the case, under s 22 and s 17 of the Women’s Charter read with s 105, as I shall go on to explain), then it will be void. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Toh Seok Kheng</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng</span> was the mother of the deceased, who died intestate in 2009. The defendant was a Chinese national whom the deceased married without informing his family. He continued to live with his family even after the marriage and his family only found out about the existence of the defendant at the deceased’s funeral. After the deceased’s death, the plaintiff applied for a grant of letters of administration of the deceased’s estate but ran into difficulty because the defendant had lodged a caveat, intending to do the same herself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The plaintiff applied for, amongst others, a declaration that the marriage entered into between the deceased and the defendant was void as a “sham marriage in keeping with public policy considerations” (at [6]), alleging that the marriage was entered into to facilitate the defendant’s PR application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Prakash J dismissed the plaintiff’s application. There were procedural defects in the plaintiff’s application, given that it was mandatory for the contentious probate action to be commenced by writ. It was an abuse of process for the plaintiff to initiate an originating summons for a declaration that the plaintiff be made the sole administrator of the deceased’s estate (<span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng </span>at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Prakash J also reiterated the legal propositions stated in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee. </span>In response to the local cases cited by the plaintiffs in support of the public policy argument where the parties involved were convicted for corruption for entering into sham marriages, Prakash J stated as follows at [16]–[17]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 … I did not find [those cases] to be relevant. Those cases are not authority for the proposition that the validity<span class="font-italic"> </span>of a marriage, which must be determined solely according to the Charter’s precepts, can be affected by the motives of the spouses for entering into marriage. <span class="font-italic">Those cases did not hold that contracting such a “sham marriage” in itself offends against </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">general public policy</span><span class="font-italic"> and, </span>a fortiori<span class="font-italic">, nor did they </span><span class="font-italic">hold that it rendered the marriages in question void</span>. The tenor of those cases was that <span class="font-italic">when parties used their validly constituted marital status to obtain something available only to authentically married couples, they might be in breach of specific laws which uphold </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">specific public policies</span><span class="font-italic">, which in those </span><span class="font-italic">cases were immigration policies</span>. The outcome in those cases depended on whether the elements of those laws were satisfied, and not on whether there was a sham marriage <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 … [W]hile judges have used the term sham marriage, it is not a term of art and does not create any legal implications in and of itself.

These types of sham marriages are not relevant to this case, and I need not say more regarding whether there was a general public policy against sham marriages in that broad sense. However, with regard to immigration-advantage sham marriages <span class="font-italic">specifically</span>, I find that there was already a public policy that existed against such sham marriages in 2007. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Section 57C of the Immigration Act and s 11A of the Women’s Charter were only introduced in 2012 and 2016 respectively, after <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng </span>was decided. However, I do not find that a public policy against sham marriages only existed once these provisions came into effect. I am of the view that such a public policy had always existed and that s 57C of the Immigration Act merely created a <span class="font-italic">specific </span>and <span class="font-italic">targeted </span>offence against such sham marriages. Prior to the enactment of s 57C, acts associated with such sham marriages were frequently prosecuted under other statutory provisions, namely s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the PCA or s 57(1)(<span class="font-italic">k</span>) of the Immigration Act (<span class="font-italic">Mehra</span><span class="font-italic"> Radhika v Public Prosecutor </span>[2015] 1 SLR 96 (“<span class="font-italic">Mehra</span><span class="font-italic"> Radhika</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32]).

However, in my view, it is proper for the courts to identify such a public policy, so long as it is attributable to a constitutionally authoritative source, as stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">UKM v Attorney-General </span>[2019] 3 SLR 874 (“<span class="font-italic">UKM</span>”) at [162(a)(i)].

This type of sham marriage corrupts the very sanctity of marriage as the fundamental purpose underpinning the marriage is to obtain an immigration benefit fraudulently. This view is grounded in the provisions of the Women’s Charter, specifically s 46(1), which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Rights and duties</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">46.</span>—(1) Upon the solemnization of marriage, the husband and wife shall be <span class="font-italic">mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union</span> and in caring and providing for the children. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In an immigration-advantage sham marriage, the parties have evinced an intention to subvert the exhortation contained in s 46(1) of the Women’s Charter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Furthermore, the long title of the Women’s Charter states that it is “an Act to provide for monogamous marriages”, which in turn is defined in s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Interpretation Act”) to mean “a marriage which is … contracted as a voluntary <span class="font-italic">union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others during the continuance of the marriage</span>” [emphasis added]. An immigration-advantage sham marriage is inconsistent with the fundamental assumption in the Women’s Charter that marriage should carry with it all the duties and obligations that parties are “mutually bound to co-operate” in upholding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Therefore, that there was a general public policy against immigration-advantage sham marriages is also supported by the provisions of the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 <span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See </span>was a recent case decided by Edmund Leow JC in 2016. The deceased died in 2013, leaving more than $170,000 in his CPF accounts. He had nominated his sisters, the plaintiffs, as the beneficiaries of his CPF moneys in 2009. When the plaintiffs visited the CPF Board after the deceased’s death, they discovered that his nomination had been automatically revoked. Unknown to them, the deceased had married the defendant in 2011. The plaintiffs were convinced that this was a sham marriage and therefore initiated an action to prevent the defendant from obtaining a share of the deceased’s CPF moneys.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Leow JC found that the marriage between the deceased and the defendant was a sham marriage, entered into so the defendant could live and work in Singapore (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an immigration-advantage sham marriage). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 He next considered the issue of whether the marriage was void under the Women’s Charter. The plaintiffs in that case referred to s 22 of the Women’s Charter, which provides that every marriage solemnised in Singapore shall be void unless it is solemnised on the authority of a “valid marriage licence” issued by the Registrar of Marriages. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>at [45], Prakash J had stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The reference to a “valid marriage licence” … must be read as meaning a marriage licence issued by the Registrar of Marriages when he was correctly satisfied that all the requirements of s 17(2) had been met. He would have been so satisfied if the statutory declaration made by each of the parties to the proposed marriage correctly stated that there was no lawful impediment to the marriage. <span class="font-italic">If the deponent of the statutory declaration was wrong in declaring that there was </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no lawful impediment</span><span class="font-italic"> to the proposed marriage, then that </span><span class="font-italic">wrongful declaration would, in my view, have the effect of invalidating the marriage licence because the licence would have been issued on an incorrect basis, the Registrar’s satisfaction having been procured by a wrongful declaration</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The plaintiffs contended that when parties enter into a marriage “with ulterior intent and motive, or without any intention to enter into a genuine marriage, then this would constitute a lawful impediment” (<span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See </span>at [39]). I note that this argument is quite different from one that alleges that a sham marriage is a lawful impediment because it is contrary to public policy, breaches other penal provisions and constitutes a fraud against the authorities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In any event, Leow JC was not persuaded that an intention to enter into a sham marriage qualified as a lawful impediment. Leow JC endorsed Prakash J’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>that “the law desists from identifying what are the ‘proper’ motives of marriage and does not allow the parties’ private motives to undermine the validity of the marriage” (<span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See </span>at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Leow JC also noted that “it cannot be open to two individuals to enter into a marriage and then say, perhaps months or even years down the road, that the marriage was void all along merely because they did not have the requisite intention to enter into a genuine marriage” (<span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See </span>at [43]). I generally agree with this statement. However, such marriages are not the type of sham marriages that I am concerned with in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Leow JC further observed that “prior to the introduction of s 57C of the Immigration Act, there was no clear parliamentary intention that such sham marriages should be void” (<span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See </span>at [48]). As I have explained above, I would respectfully differ and find that there was such a public policy against immigration-advantage sham marriages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Leow JC also mentioned that during the second reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2012 by the then-Second Minister for Home Affairs, “there was no suggestion that the validity of marriages would be affected by the criminalisation of marriages of convenience to obtain an immigration advantage” (<span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See </span>at [48]). The lack of express reference to whether a sham marriage before 1 October 2016 is valid can, at best, support the view that the issue was not considered by Parliament. But Parliament had enacted s 11A of the Women’s Charter to invalidate all immigration-advantage sham marriages. The logical inference must, therefore, be that such marriages that were criminalised prior to 1 October 2016 cannot be valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Therefore, with the greatest of respect, I disagree with the reasons provided by Leow JC to justify why a sham marriage before 1 October 2016 is not void under the Women’s Charter. As I shall further explain, the Marriage, being an immigration-advantage sham marriage as borne out by the facts in this case, is a void marriage, notwithstanding that it was solemnised in 2007 before s 57C of the Immigration Act and s 11A of the Women’s Charter came into force. Before I discuss these reasons, I shall briefly refer to some academic commentaries which may be relevant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Academic commentaries</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The first commentary is by Associate Professor Chen Siyuan in “Sham Marriages, Ancillary Powers, and Moral Discourse: Toh Seok Kheng v. Huang Huiqun; ADP v. ADQ” (2011) <span class="font-italic">Research Collection School of Law </span>1–10. In this commentary, Assoc Prof Chen proffered reasons for why a sham marriage should be void and how this could be justified. He acknowledged that s 105 of the Women’s Charter “quite categorically” rules out any other ground for making a marriage void. However, he then suggested that the court could have recourse to its inherent powers to render a sham marriage void. Assoc Prof Chen suggested that the invoking of the court’s inherent powers could be justified as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]e may have to pitch the endeavour (of justifying why a sham marriage should be void) at a higher level of abstraction and consider the general tenor and purpose of the Women’s Charter. It is perhaps not fanciful to suggest that the Women’s Charter is ultimately about protecting the rights of women and children – and a wide spectrum at that. Such protection, it seems, must be motivated by a recognition of the importance of families in Singapore. If so, upholding sham marriages as valid marriages (even if done indirectly) serves neither of those two broad purposes. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Assoc Prof Chen’s view is contrary to that of Professor Leong Wai Kum in “Clarity in the Law of Valid, Void and Voidable Non-Muslim Marriages” (2009) 21 SAcLJ 575. In this case note, Prof Leong opined at para 21:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is crucial that there be certainty as to when a solemnisation of marriage is successful or, in the alternative, is a nullity. The premise is that only failure of compliance with, first, the statutory requirements of the process of solemnisation, or second, the statutory requirements of the parties possessing capacity to marry, renders the solemnisation invalid. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 While I share the concerns raised by Assoc Prof Chen, I am of the view that the court’s inherent powers should not be readily invoked, especially if an immigration-advantage sham marriage can be declared void on some ground stated in s 105 of the Women’s Charter. In this case, the provisions that are particularly relevant are ss 22 and 17 of the Women’s Charter, and s 22 is expressly referred to in s 105 of the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sections 22 and 17(2)(d) of the Women’s Charter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 To recapitulate, s 22 of the Women’s Charter, which embodies one of the grounds on which a marriage is void under s 105 of the Women’s Charter, states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Requirements for valid marriage</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span>—(1) Every marriage solemnized in Singapore shall be void unless it is solemnized —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) on the authority of a <span class="font-italic">valid marriage </span><span class="font-italic">licence</span> issued by the Registrar or a valid special marriage licence granted by the Minister; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) by the Registrar or a person who has been granted a licence to solemnize marriages. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 As stated in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>at [45], the reference to a “valid marriage licence” in s 22 of the Women’s Charter must be read as meaning a marriage licence issued by the Registrar of Marriages when he was correctly satisfied that all the requirements of s 17(2) have been met.

The first matter to be considered is whether a lawful impediment <span class="font-italic">must </span>be identified with reference to a specific prohibition in the Women’s Charter. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>at [50], Prakash J suggested that a lawful impediment can be identified “notwithstanding the absence of a specific provision so promulgating”. This was in the context of a discussion of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim Ying v </span><span class="font-italic">Hiok Kian Ming Eric </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 525 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Ying</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Lim Ying</span>, the respondent was a female-born transsexual. Following sex reassignment surgery, his sex was re-recorded on his NRIC as male. He later married the petitioner. The petitioner claimed that she had no knowledge that the respondent was a transsexual and applied for a judgment of nullity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 When <span class="font-italic">Lim Ying </span>was decided, s 12 of the Women’s Charter, which pertains to avoidance of marriages between persons of the same sex, had yet to be enacted. K S Rajah JC held that the sex of a person was to be determined by the sex assigned to him <span class="font-italic">at birth</span>, and not the sex shown on the NRIC (this has since been legislatively overturned by s 12(2) of the Women’s Charter). Given that both the petitioner and the respondent were of the same sex, the marriage was void. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Prakash J observed in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ah Thee </span>that Rajah JC did not expressly refer to s 105 of the Women’s Charter and whether a judgment of nullity could be made on the basis of a ground that was not specified in s 105. Nevertheless, Prakash J explained that <span class="font-italic">Lim Ying </span>could be decided on the ground that the fact that the parties were of the same gender was a lawful impediment to the relationship. Prakash J explained at [50]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As Rajah JC reasoned, it is clear that <span class="font-italic">the Charter was promulgated on the basis that marriage is a legal relationship that can only be entered into between a male and a female</span>. He noted that the preamble to the Charter states that it is “[a]n Act to provide for monogamous marriages”. In the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1985 Rev Ed), “monogamous marriage” was then, and still is, defined as “a marriage which is recognised by the law of the place where it is contracted as a voluntary union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others during the continuance of the marriage”. Furthermore, there are numerous references to “husband” and “wife” in the Charter and those terms are gender specific. Hence, it is unarguable that even as it stood in 1992 when <span class="font-italic">Lim Ying </span>was decided, it was a fundamental assumption underlying and informing the provisions of the Charter that a marriage had to be between a male and a female. <span class="font-italic">Thus, persons of the same gender could not marry under the Charter and being of the same gender constituted a “lawful impediment” to the marriage</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Prakash J’s rationalisation of <span class="font-italic">Lim Ying </span>is entirely consistent with the ordinary meaning of s 17(2) of the Women’s Charter, which does not require the lawful impediment to be based on a <span class="font-italic">specific </span>provision in the Women’s Charter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 For completeness, I note that during the Select Committee proceedings on the Women’s Charter Bill in 1960, the Chairman of the Select Committee, Sir George Oehlers, had commented that s 17(2) “ought to be amended to make it clear that the only impediments are those laid down by the Women’s Charter, and nothing more” (<span class="font-italic">R</span>e<span class="font-italic">port of the Select Committee on the Women’s Charter Bill</span> (Legislative Assembly 16 of 1960, 19 May 1960) at p 193). However, this statement arose from a discussion about whether impediments imposed by any given religion could affect the validity of a marriage. In my view, it did not mean that the impediments must be expressly identified in the Women’s Charter. In any event, s 17(2), as it was eventually passed, did not state that the impediments must be expressly identified in the Women’s Charter. It is trite that if the ordinary meaning of a provision is not ambiguous or obscure, then the court is not permitted to use extraneous material to depart from it (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span><span class="font-italic">v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 at [54]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether an intention to enter into an immigration-advantage sham marriage is a lawful impediment to a proposed marriage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The next issue is whether an intention to enter into an immigration-advantage sham marriage is a lawful impediment to a proposed marriage. In my view, where the sole purpose of the marriage was to assist one party to obtain PR in exchange for gratification and the parties never had any intention to enter into a genuine marital relationship, this constitutes a lawful impediment to a proposed marriage. Therefore, the wrongful declaration that there is no lawful impediment to the proposed marriage invalidates the marriage licence issued and the marriage is void. I accept that a lawful impediment that is not expressly identified in the Women’s Charter should not be easily found. The threshold to be crossed ought to be a high one, in the interests of certainty. Nevertheless, for the following reasons, I am of the view that the threshold has been crossed for immigration-advantage sham marriages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138  In this regard, I respectfully depart from the decision of Leow JC in <span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See</span> and the decision of Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng</span>, in so far as Prakash J reached the conclusion that such sham marriages were valid. However, I note that the issue of whether an intention to enter into such a sham marriage constitutes a lawful impediment does not appear to have been an issue in <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng</span>. The reasons for my finding that an intention to enter into an immigration-advantage sham marriage constitutes a lawful impediment are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Firstly, as I have elaborated above at [97]–[117] in my discussion of <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng</span>, there has always been a general public policy against such sham marriages, even before s 57C of the Immigration Act and s 11A of the Women’s Charter were enacted. I would depart from <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng </span>in so far as it stands for the proposition that such a public policy did not exist and ought to be reserved to Parliament for “articulation, delineation and enactment” (<span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng </span>at [15]). I take the contrary view for reasons, which to recapitulate, are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The then-Second Minister for Home Affairs had expressly stated during the second reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill 2012 that while s 57C of the Immigration Act created a new substantive offence that directly targeted sham marriages, there were other laws which were used to address sham marriages prior to s 57C. As I have pointed out, these were s 5 of the PCA and s 57(1)(<span class="font-italic">k</span>) of the Immigration Act. Therefore, s 57C of the Immigration Act did not introduce a <span class="font-italic">new </span>public policy against sham marriages. It only introduced a specific and targeted offence against sham marriages. Unlike in <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng</span>, I am unable to make a distinction between a general public policy against sham marriages (which Prakash J found to <span class="font-italic">not</span> exist) and a specific immigration policy against parties who marry in order for one party to obtain immigration/residency benefits and the other to obtain monetary gratification (a public policy which Prakash J accepted existed) (<span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng </span>at [15]–[16]). If one is only concerned with immigration-advantage sham marriages specifically, there would be no need to draw fine distinctions between the existence of the general and specific public policies referred to in <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Seok Kheng</span>. Parties may enter into marriages for so-called improper motives, or intend to conduct their respective lives as though they were unmarried. But this case is not concerned with such marriages and whether such marriages contravene public policy. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A public policy against sham marriages arises naturally from the values or purposes embodied in the Women’s Charter. While Prakash J had said in <span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Seok Kheng </span>at [10] that “[t]he idea that marriage has a special moral status and involves established moral obligations is … philosophically contentious”, these values or purposes are expressly stated in the Women’s Charter. In my view, it is proper for the courts to have regard to the relevant provisions in order to determine whether a public policy against immigration-advantage sham marriages exists. This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">UKM </span>at [139]. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) For example, the long title of the Women’s Charter states that it is “an Act to provide for monogamous marriages”, which in turn is defined in s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act to mean “a marriage which is … contracted as a voluntary <span class="font-italic">union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others during the continuance of the marriage</span>”. An immigration-advantage sham marriage, like in this case, is entered into solely for the purpose of applying for PR and not with the intention to form a “<span class="font-italic">union of one man and one woman </span><span class="font-italic">to the exclusion of all others during the continuance of the marriage”</span>. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Furthermore, s 46(1) of the Women’s Charter “sets out society’s aspirations of how marriage partners should behave”, and enshrines a legal expectation that husbands and wives are to take their marriage seriously as a permanent union which should be safeguarded (see <span class="font-italic">UKM </span>at [189], citing Debbie Ong, <span class="font-italic">International Issues in Family Law in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2015) at para 4.1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Secondly, an immigration-advantage sham marriage would have been in <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>breach of penal provisions even in 2007. I have identified s 5 of the PCA and s 57(1)(<span class="font-italic">k</span>) of the Immigration Act as provisions under which parties to such sham marriages have been prosecuted under. I should also highlight that an immigration-advantage sham marriage might possibly also constitute an offence of cheating <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the Registrar of Marriages and ICA as defined under s 415 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and punishable under the relevant punishment provisions. Section 415 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">415</span>. Whoever, by deceiving any person, whether or not such deception was the sole or main inducement, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to any person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to “cheat”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Thirdly, flowing from the two points above, it is unquestionable that had the Registrar of Marriages been aware that the marriage between the Deceased and the Defendant was a sham and that they never intended to live as husband and wife but went through a marriage ceremony as a charade so as to enable the Defendant to obtain PR, he would not have issued a marriage licence. The parties to such a sham marriage would have, therefore, intended to defraud and deceive the Registrar of Marriages. In such cases, the institution of marriage is essentially being used for a fraudulent purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In my view, having considered the three points above, it would be a perverse and unjust outcome if an intention to enter into a sham marriage does not constitute a lawful impediment to a proposed marriage. This would be entirely contrary to public policy, wholly inconsistent with existing penal provisions and would condone a fraud against the authorities. More importantly, this immigration-advantage sham marriage corrupts the institution of marriage which is sacrosanct. Therefore, it is not right that such sham marriages would be valid simply because they were entered into before 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The Defendant contends that such a ruling would lead to “complications” to other statutes.

</div>
</div> However, such concerns are not warranted.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Defendant states that a legitimate child may lose his “legitimacy” if his parents’ marriage is found to be a sham marriage. However, if the parties had indeed intended to have a child and to raise a child together, then that would clearly fall outside the definition of a sham marriage. This is because the parties would have contemplated that their marriage would result in a genuine marital relationship, taking it outside the definition of an immigration-related sham marriage.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Defendant also points out that under s 73 of the CLPA, a nomination by the policyholder of his spouse and/or children on his life insurance policy automatically creates a statutory trust in favour of the nominees. If the marriage is found to be a sham marriage, this statutory trust would no longer be valid and creditors of the deceased would be entitled to the moneys payable under the policy. However, if the marriage is, indeed, a sham marriage, there is no reason why the policyholder will nominate his purported spouse to be the beneficiary of his life insurance policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Therefore, I hold that the Marriage in this case, which was solemnised on 20 January 2007, is a void marriage under the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings on the second issue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Parliament’s intention in enacting s 11A of the Women’s Charter <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> have been to affirm the validity of all immigration-advantage sham marriages that took place before that provision’s commencement date. That must be so, as couples of immigration-advantage sham marriages were prosecuted under the relevant statutes – notably, s 57(1)(<span class="font-italic">k</span>) of the Immigration Act and s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the PCA, and later s 57C of the Immigration Act. This demonstrates a general public policy against immigration-advantage sham marriages even prior to the enactment of s 11A of the Women’s Charter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The existence of a general public policy against immigration-advantage sham marriages also means that an intention to enter into an immigration-advantage sham marriage constitutes a lawful impediment to a proposed marriage within the meaning of s 17(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Women’s Charter. A wrongful declaration that there was no lawful impediment thereby invalidates the marriage licence, and renders a marriage void under s 22 read with s 105 of the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: The Defendant’s status under various statutes </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147  The final issue is whether the Defendant is a “surviving spouse” under s 7 of the ISA and a “wife” under s 73 of the CLPA. This would determine whether the Defendant is entitled to the Deceased’s estate (pursuant to s 7 of the ISA), CPF moneys (pursuant to s 25 of the CPF Act) and life insurance proceeds (pursuant to s 73 of the CLPA). As I have found that the marriage is void, it follows that the Defendant does <span class="font-italic">not </span>fall within the definition of these terms. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Defendant is a “surviving spouse” under s 7 of the ISA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The ISA is a relatively short piece of legislation which, as stated in the long title, “make[s] provision for the distribution of intestate estates”. Of particular relevance in this case are the distribution rules set out in s 7 of the ISA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The Deceased died intestate with neither a will nor CPF nomination made. He also did not have any children and his parents were no longer alive at the time of his passing. Therefore, the relevant rule for distribution is Rule 1 of s 7 of the ISA, which provides that the “surviving spouse … shall be entitled to the whole of the estate”. As I have found that the marriage is void, it follows that the Defendant is not a “surviving spouse” under the ISA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 For completeness, I note that this result ties in neatly with the legislative intent embodied in the intestacy distribution rules set out in s 7 of the ISA. This reinforces the argument that a sham marriage, as defined in this case, is a void marriage under the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The legislative intent of s 7 of the ISA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The legislative intent of s 7 of the ISA was to <span class="font-italic">modernise </span>the rules of intestate distribution to give equal rights to both spouses, as discernible from the second reading of the Intestate Succession Bill 1966 (Bill 47 of 1966) (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(12 December 1966) vol 25 at cols 563–565). The then-Minister for Law and National Development, Mr E W Barker, had observed that the law relating to intestate distribution in Singapore, prior to the enactment of the ISA, was contained in the Statute of Distributions 1670 (22 &amp; 23 Car II c 10) (UK), a 17th century statute in England (“Statute of Distributions”). The then-Minister for Law and National Development had stated that the rules contained in the Statute of Distributions were outmoded, and had in fact been repealed in England. For example, under the Statute of Distributions, if a woman died intestate leaving a husband, he would be entitled to the whole of her estate. However, if a man died intestate leaving a wife, she would only be entitled to one-half of the estate. Therefore, the legislative intent of s 7 of the ISA was to <span class="font-italic">modernise </span>the rules of intestate distribution to give equal rights to both spouses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The guiding principles underpinning the new rules contained in s 7 of the ISA were not expressly articulated by the then-Minister for Law and National Development. However, in England, the new law, as reflected in the Administration of Estates Act 1925 (c 23) (UK), was based on the <span class="font-italic">presumed intention or wishes </span>of the deceased person, as opposed to <span class="font-italic">historical precedent</span> (C H Sherrin and R C Bonehill, <span class="font-italic">The Law and Practice of Intestate Succession </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2004) at p 19). In fact, what had transpired was that the new English law was based upon an actual examination of a large number of wills, in order to ascertain the wishes of the majority of testators. As explained by Professor Gareth Miller in <span class="font-italic">The Machinery of Succession </span>(Professional Books Limited, 1977) at p 92:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This reflects the now generally held view that, since the legislature is in effect making a will for the deceased, the rules of intestate succession should coincide as far as possible with the probable wishes of the majority of people who die intestate. In some countries, although this general approach has been adopted, the legislature has in some respects acted on the basis of policy considerations rather than on the basis of the probable wishes of the intestate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 There is no indication that Singapore’s new rules on intestate distribution had departed from this general approach based on the presumed intentions of the testator. Therefore, with this principle in mind, Parliament could not have intended for a party to a sham marriage to fall within the definition of a “surviving spouse” for the purposes of the ISA. This is because the <span class="font-italic">presumed</span> intention of the deceased must have been for his entire estate to be left to his parents and siblings, and not to a “spouse” in name with whom he had no genuine marital relationship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 If a sham marriage is a valid marriage, as a matter of logic, it ought to follow that the widow would be a “surviving spouse” and entitled to rely on the intestacy distribution rules. However, if a sham marriage is a void marriage, as I have found, then the widow is not a “surviving spouse” and this is consistent with the legislative intent underpinning the ISA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Defendant is a “surviving spouse” under s 25 of the CPF Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The term “spouse” appears frequently in the CPF Act. In this case, the relevant provision is s 25 of the CPF Act, which concerns how CPF moneys are payable on the death of a CPF member. The Deceased did not make any CPF nomination. Therefore, the relevant subsection is s 25(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPF Act, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Moneys payable on death of member</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25.–(2) Subject to subsection (2A), where, at the time of the death of a member of the Fund, <span class="font-italic">no person has been nominated by him</span> under subsection (1), the total amount payable on his death out of the Fund shall be paid to the Public Trustee for disposal in accordance with —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the <span class="font-italic">Intestate Succession Act</span> (Cap. 146), if the member is not a Muslim at the time of his death; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Strictly speaking, s 25 of the CPF Act does <span class="font-italic">not</span> contain the term “surviving spouse”. This term becomes relevant because s 25(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPF Act provides that if the deceased has not made a nomination, it is the ISA that shall determine how the deceased’s CPF moneys are to be payable. As per Rule 1 of s 7 of the ISA, it is the “surviving spouse” who will be entitled to all the CPF moneys if there are no children and no surviving parent. This follows the general rule as regards how the deceased’s estate is to be distributed if there are no children and no surviving parent, which has been discussed above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 As I have found that the marriage is void, and that the Defendant is not a “surviving spouse” under s 7 of the ISA, it follows that the Defendant will not be entitled to rely on s 25 of the CPF Act to claim the Deceased’s CPF moneys. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether a sham marriage is a “marriage” under s 25(5)(a) of the CPF Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 A related issue is whether a sham marriage is a “marriage” under s 25(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPF Act, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Any nomination made by a member of the Fund under subsection (1) shall be revoked —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) <span class="font-italic">by his marriage</span>, whether the marriage was contracted before, on or after 15th May 1980; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Essentially, s 25(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPF Act provides that where a CPF member has made a valid nomination, this will be automatically revoked as a matter of law upon his marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In <span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See</span>, Leow JC held that a sham marriage did not fall within the definition of a “marriage” under s 25(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPF Act. Therefore, it would <span class="font-italic">not</span> have the effect of invalidating a valid CPF nomination (<span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See </span>at [52]). This was notwithstanding his earlier finding that a sham marriage is a valid marriage under the Women’s Charter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 With respect, if a sham marriage is a valid marriage under the Women’s Charter, then it ought to follow that it will have the effect of automatically revoking a member’s prior CPF nomination, as with all other valid marriages. In contrast, if a sham marriage as defined in this case is a void marriage, then it is void <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span> and it is treated as though it never took place (<span class="font-italic">ADP v ADQ </span>[2012] 2 SLR 143 at [50]). Therefore, it would follow that a sham marriage will not have the effect of automatically revoking a valid CPF nomination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 This result is consistent with Parliament’s intent in introducing s 25(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). As noted by Leow JC in <span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See</span>, s 25(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) was introduced to prevent a situation where the immediate family of the deceased is left without financial provision due to the inadvertent failure of the deceased to update his CPF nomination. However, a party to a sham marriage could not be said to be part of his immediate family (<span class="font-italic">Soon Ah See </span>at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Instead of finding that a sham marriage is a void marriage, Leow JC read down the meaning of “marriage” in s 25(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPF Act. Conversely, in my judgment, a sham marriage is a void marriage and since it is void <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span>, it will not have the legal effect of automatically revoking a valid CPF nomination. Although this issue is not relevant in this case as the Deceased did not make a CPF nomination, it further reinforces the argument that a sham marriage is a void marriage as it attacks the very foundation of the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Defendant is a “wife” under s 73 of the CLPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The next issue is whether the Defendant is a “wife” under s 73 of the CLPA and therefore entitled to claim the proceeds under any of the Deceased’s life insurance policies. Section 73(1) of the CLPA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Moneys payable under policy of assurance not to form part of the estate of the insured</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">73.</span>—(1) A policy of assurance effected by any man on his own life and <span class="font-italic">expressed</span>, before the date of commencement of section 10 of the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2009, <span class="font-italic">to be for the benefit of his wife or of his children or of his wife and children or any of them</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> … shall create a trust in favour of the objects therein named, and the moneys payable … shall not, so long as any object of the trust remains unperformed, form part of the estate of the insured or be subject to his or her debts.

In any event, I also note that there was no policy before me that was “expressed … to be for the benefit of his wife”. Indeed, the Defendant was not even mentioned in any policy document.

In summary, I make the following findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Firstly, the Marriage was an immigration-advantage sham marriage. The Deceased had agreed to marry the Defendant to help her obtain PR status and he was paid a sum of money in return. In coming to this decision, I find that the couple did not live as husband and wife after the purported Marriage, that there was no financial support from the Deceased to the Defendant, and that there was no evidence of phone and electronic communication between them or photographs of the couple (other than their wedding photographs). Furthermore, the objective evidence shows that the Defendant regarded himself as single. I place significant weight on the evidence of PW4, who was the most objective, credible and reliable witness. She had testified that the Deceased had informed her that the Marriage was a sham and that he was paid to enter into the Marriage in order to help the Defendant obtain PR status. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Secondly, I find that the Marriage is void. An immigration-advantage sham marriage is void under the Women’s Charter. Although s 11A of the Women’s Charter does not apply because the Marriage was solemnised before its operative date, it does not follow that immigration-advantage sham marriages before that date are valid. In this regard, I find that an intention to enter into an immigration-advantage sham marriage constitutes a “lawful impediment” to the proposed marriage. Immigration-advantage sham marriages contravene public policy and infringe penal laws such as s 5 of the PCA and ss 57C and 57(1)(<span class="font-italic">k</span>) of the Immigration Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Thirdly, it follows from my finding that the Marriage is void that the Defendant is not a “surviving spouse” under s 7 of the ISA or a “wife” under s 73 of the CLPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Given my findings above, I need not deal with the Plaintiffs’ additional argument regarding the forfeiture rule. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 For the reasons given above, I make the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I grant the First Declaration that the Marriage between the Deceased and the Defendant was a sham marriage. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I grant the Second Declaration that the Deceased’s CPF moneys and all his other assets are to be distributed among the Deceased’s immediate family members according to the prevailing laws, rules and regulations to the exclusion of the Defendant. For the avoidance of doubt, the entitlement of the Deceased’s immediate family members will have to be subjected to the applicable bankruptcy provisions, if any, as the Deceased was an undischarged bankrupt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 As the Plaintiffs have succeeded in their claim, they are entitled to costs. The costs are to be taxed if not agreed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kelvin Lee Ming Hui and Ong Xin Ying Samantha (WNLEX LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>George Reny Margaret and Melvyn Low Kok Keong (Belinda Ang Tang &amp; Partners LLC) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
