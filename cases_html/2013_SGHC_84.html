<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Ang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This claim and counterclaim originated from a
                    sub-lease agreement (“the Sub-lease”) between the plaintiff, MK
                    Distripark Pte Ltd (“MKD”) and the defendant, Pedder Warehousing
                    &amp; Logistics (S) Pte Ltd (“Pedder”) in respect of 3A Jalan
                    Terusan, MK Distripark, Singapore 619302 (“the Premises”). As the
                    Premises were owned by the Jurong Town Corporation (“JTC”), the
                    continuation of the Sub-lease to the full term of 49 months was subject to
                    MKD’s procurement of JTC’s approval for an extension of the initial
                    approval for the Sub-lease of 12 months. Any such extension of initial approval
                    was to be on terms “no less favourable” than those contained in
                    the Sub-lease. Pedder refused a novation arrangement MKD proposed whereby Pedder
                    would take over from MKD the lease which the latter had of the Premises on the
                    ground that the terms procured for this arrangement were less favourable to
                    Pedder than those under the Sub-lease. Following such refusal, MKD brought
                    action against Pedder for breach of the Sub-lease and this led to MKD treating
                    the Sub-lease as forfeited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I decided as a preliminary point that there was
                    no merit to the main claim and proceeded to hear the counterclaim. I now give
                    the grounds for my decision in the main claim (which is the subject of an appeal
                    by MKD in CA 20 of 2013) and judgment for the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Premises were, at all material times, the
                    subject of a JTC lease held by HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore)
                    Limited as trustee of Mapletree Logistics Trust (“Mapletree”).
                    Mapletree entered into a lease with MKD on 2 May 2008 to let the Premises for a
                    term of seven years (“the MKD Lease”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After about two and a half years, MKD found that
                    it was no longer profitable for it to continue the MKD Lease, and it sought to
                    sublet the Premises for the remainder of the seven year term. Accordingly, MKD
                    began negotiating with Pedder for the Sub-lease. On 11 January 2011, MKD issued
                    a letter of offer to Pedder for a sub-lease of the Premises for a period of
                    49 months, from 1 April 2011 to 30 April 2015, subject to the necessary
                    approvals from JTC and all other relevant government authorities. Pedder
                    countersigned the letter of offer on 12 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The structure of the Sub-lease was not
                    straightforward. As the Premises were owned by JTC, they were subject to strict
                    subletting policies. It was ultimately for Mapletree, as the head tenant,
                    to apply for permission for MKD to sublet the Premises. There were therefore two
                    layers of consent:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mapletree’s consent and
                        decision to apply to JTC; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     JTC’s approval allowing the Premises to be sublet to
                        Pedder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As a result, there was no guarantee that 100% of
                    the Premises could be let for the full term of 49 months. It should be noted at
                    the outset that Mapletree’s consent to the continuation of the Sub-lease
                    was not to be unreasonably withheld (see cl 3.19.2 of the MKD Lease) and that
                    there was no serious suggestion throughout the trial that Mapletree had any
                    intention to withhold consent. Both parties had proceeded on the basis that
                    Mapletree’s consent was more of a formality and it was only during the
                    hearing of further submissions on the counterclaim that counsel for MKD
                    suggested that Mapletree’s consent was an additional wild card to be added
                    to the mix.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In-house legal counsel for MKD, Loh How Yee
                    (“Loh”), sent Pedder a draft Sub-lease on 25 January 2011, and
                    Mapletree simultaneously applied to JTC for consent for the Sub-lease. JTC met
                    with both MKD and Mapletree on 4 March 2011 (“the Tripartite
                    Meeting”). JTC indicated during that meeting that a sublet of 100% of the
                    Premises could be approved for a year, but would be subject to review and
                    approval after the first year. After this meeting, MKD and Mapletree began to
                    explore different options to ensure that the full term of the Sub-lease could be
                    secured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       To this end, Loh furnished a document labelled
                    “Lease of 3A, Jalan Terusan” to Mapletree on 9 March 2011. This
                    document contained a proposed lease to Pedder, where Pedder would be put into a
                    direct landlord-tenant relationship with Mapletree under a new lease agreement.
                    This document further outlined the salient points of the proposed agreement
                    between Mapletree and MKD as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    [T]o suspend the
                            Original Lease Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    MKD
                            to pick up the difference between Original [<em>sic</em>] Lease Agreement and New Lease
                        Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    If New Lease Agreement
                            with Pedder is terminated:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a)    To re-activate Original Lease
                            Agreement;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)    Mapletree to assign to MKD the right of
                                Landlord against Pedder under New Lease Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    MKD shall continue to have the option to renew for
                            further 7 years under Clause 6.14 of Original Lease
                                Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Mapletree did not respond to this proposal until
                    14 March 2011, by which time it had already received informal approval from JTC
                    for 100% subletting to Pedder for a year (from 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012).
                    Mapletree thus suggested that MKD proceed with the Sub-lease for 49 months,
                    subject to review after the expiration of JTC’s consent. JTC’s
                    consent was formally given to Mapletree by way of a letter dated 25 March
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 29 March 2011, MKD sent another draft
                    Sub-lease to Pedder which included a new clause, cl 2A which read as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After the Sub-lease was signed, MKD continued
                    to explore options to ensure the full term of the Sub-lease. On 1 April 2011, a
                    meeting between MKD, Mapletree and JTC took place, where the idea of novating
                    the MKD Lease to Pedder was mooted. Thereafter, Mapletree began to draft a
                    novation agreement. Mapletree sent a draft of the Supplemental Deed for novation
                    (“the Supplemental Deed”) to MKD on 31 May 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Supplemental Deed was forwarded to Pauline
                    on 15 June 2011. According to Pauline, this was the first time novation had been

                    onerous than the MKD-Pedder Lease”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> A copy
                    of the MKD Lease was also given to Pedder for their perusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Pedder took time to discuss the draft
                    Supplemental Deed and First Deed (collectively, “the Novation
                    Agreements”) and the MKD Lease with its legal consultant and
                    shareholders. On 26 August 2011, counsel for Pedder, Mr Tan Yew Fai
                    (“Tan”), wrote to MKD to inform MKD that Pedder was “unable
                    to execute the Novation Agreements and/or to proceed with the same” as
                    “[t]he Tenant’s obligations under the Main Lease are much more

                    Pedder’s agreement to the Supplemental Deed and the First Deed. This was
                    ultimately unsuccessful. On 14 September 2011, Pauline wrote:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 7 October 2011, MKD issued a notice to
                    Pedder pursuant to s 18(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61,
                    1994 Rev Ed), alleging breach of cl 2A(c) of the Sub-lease, which obliged Pedder
                    to agree to any arrangement for continued subletting of the Premises to Pedder
                    if the terms and conditions were no less favourable than those set out in the
                    Sub-lease. MKD claimed that, by failing to sign the Novation Agreements, Pedder
                    had breached its obligations under cl 2A(c), and MKD was entitled to treat the
                    Sub-lease as forfeited. A final notice to remedy the alleged breach was issued
                    by MKD on 2 November 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 9 November 2011, MKD returned the rental
                    sum of $173,765.86 paid by Pedder for the month of October, pursuant to its
                    election to treat the Sub-Lease as forfeited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     When Pedder still refused to sign the Novation
                    Agreements, MKD issued a letter of demand on 16 November 2011 for $324,796 as
                    damages for the alleged breach and proceeded to file this action on 22 November
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Pedder counterclaimed alleging that
                    MKD’s failure to apply for an extension of JTC’s approval for
                    subletting of the Premises beyond 31 March 2012 was a breach of MKD’s
                    obligations under the Sub-lease; this breach made it impossible for the
                    Sub-lease to continue to its full term. The Sub-lease came to an end on 31 March
                    2012 and Pedder moved out of the Premises on 3 April 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     MKD claimed damages for Pedder’s alleged
                    breach of cl 2A(c) of the Sub-lease. Pedder claimed damages for MKD’s
                    failure and/or refusal to apply to JTC for the continued lease of the Premises
                    and for the resultant loss of a chance to continue with the Sub-lease of the
                    Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The issue in MKD’s claim was whether
                    Pedder had breached cl 2A(c) of the Sub-lease, thus entitling MKD to treat the
                    Sub-lease as forfeited. Its resolution depends on whether the Novation
                    Agreements were on terms “no less favourable” than those
                    contained in the Sub-lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The issue in Pedder’s counterclaim was
                    whether MKD had breached cl 2A(b) of the Sub-lease by failing to use its
                    best endeavours to obtain JTC approval for a continuation of the Sub-lease of
                    100% of the gross floor area (“GFA”) or as much thereof as JTC
                    would allow. If there was a breach, what damages would flow from this
                    breach?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The main claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Clause 2A(c) obliges Pedder to accept the
                    lease of the Premises or part thereof:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in the event Lessor [<em>sic</em>] is able to
                        procure the continue [<em>sic</em>] lease of the
                        Demised Premises to Lessee on no less favourable terms and conditions than
                        this Lease Agreement. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The question is whether the Novation Agreements were on “no
                    less favourable terms and conditions” than the Sub-lease. The answer was
                    a clear no.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As a whole, it was not disputed that the MKD
                    Lease was more onerous than the Sub-lease. The whole purpose of the Supplemental
                    Deed was for Pedder to take over the rights <em>and
                        obligations</em>, including those more onerous obligations, of the MKD
                    Lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Clause 4.5 of the Supplemental Deed was also
                    more onerous than the Sub-lease. Clause 4.5 read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Existing Tenant [<em>ie</em>, MKD] and the
                        Substitute Tenant [<em>ie</em>, Pedder] shall
                        jointly and severally indemnify and hold the Landlord [<em>ie</em>, Mapletree] harmless against all liabilities, costs,
                        expenses, claims, obligations, damages and losses arising out of or in
                        connection with the Lease Agreement, the Amended Lease Agreement and/or the
                        Novation [Agreements], whether such liabilities, costs, expenses, claims,
                        obligations, damages and losses arise before, on or after the Effective date
                        [ie, the date when the Supplemental Deed was signed].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Clause 4.5 would include “liabilities,
                    costs, expenses, claims, obligations, damages and losses” which had
                    accrued under the MKD Lease before Pedder entered into the Supplemental Deed.
                    Pedder would thus have to take on a much greater scope and degree of risk of
                    liability under the Supplemental Deed than under the Sub-lease. This meant that
                    the Supplemental Deed was on terms and conditions less favourable than those
                    contained in the Sub-lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Pedder had argued that cl 3.1 of the
                    Supplemental Deed, which provided that the landlord could terminate the lease
                    with three months’ notice, was also a term more onerous than the
                    Sub-lease. However, this was incorrect. Clause 9(b) of the Sub-lease stated
                    clearly that if JTC or Mapletree were to terminate the lease of the
                    Premises:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... for any reason whatsoever, [MKD] shall be entitled, upon receiving the
                        relevant notice or becoming aware of such intention ... to notify [Pedder]
                        to end the [Sub-lease] without affecting the rights of parties herein for
                        any antecedent breach of the other party in respect of the [Sub-lease], but
                        without any liability on JTC, Mapletree or Lessor for the early
                            termination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Under both the Supplemental Deed and the Sub-lease, Pedder would have
                    no legal remedy for early termination by Mapletree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     MKD claimed that the effect of these clauses
                    would be moot because the Supplemental Deed could not be read separately from
                    the First Deed (between MKD and Pedder) which accompanied it and provided that
                    MKD would pick up the “balance obligations” which rendered the
                    Supplemental Deed more onerous than the Sub-lease. This addressed the fact that
                    the MKD Lease, in general, was more onerous than the Sub-lease, but did little
                    to ameliorate the effects of cl 4.5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Pedder would be liable to Mapletree under cl
                    4.5 for the “all liabilities, costs, expenses, claims, obligations,
                    damages and losses” incurred by MKD prior to the date of the Supplemental
                    Deed, notwithstanding the First Deed (to  which Mapletree was not a
                    party). That would <em>prima facie</em> increase
                    Pedder’s risk exposure. Even without the First Deed, Pedder could probably
                    seek a contribution from MKD or join MKD in any claim Mapletree might have
                    against Pedder under cl 4.5. Nevertheless, Pedder would be fully liable should
                    MKD be unable to pay. MKD did not argue that the availability of the legal
                    remedy of seeking a contribution meant that cl 4.5 was “no less
                    favourable” than the Sub-lease; it argued that the First Deed changed the
                    effect of cl 4.5. This proposition was unfounded. Pedder’s position
                    vis-à-vis Mapletree was unchanged by the First Deed; the First Deed did not
                    limit Pedder’s liability under cl 4.5. If MKD were to default, Pedder
                    would be fully liable to Mapletree under cl 4.5. Pedder would have to make a
                    claim against MKD under a <em>separate agreement</em>
                        (<em>ie</em>, the First Deed) and would incur
                    additional cost and expense to enforce any claim for a contribution or
                    indemnification from MKD. In theory at least, MKD could even become
                    insolvent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I, therefore, found that the First Deed did
                    not alter the effect of cl 4.5 of the Supplemental Deed, which was more onerous
                    than the terms and conditions under the Sub-lease. To my mind, there was no
                    question that the Novation Agreements were on terms which were less favourable
                    than the Sub-lease. Accordingly, I found that Pedder was not in breach of cl 2A
                    by refusing to agree to the Novation Agreements. When MKD purported to treat the
                    Sub-lease as forfeited and terminated the Sub-lease on 31 March 2012, MKD acted
                    wrongfully. It follows that the Sub-lease was still subsisting as at 9 November
                    2011 when MKD purported to reject Pedder’s payment of the October 2011
                    rent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In consequence, I found that MKD was entitled
                    to rent arrears for October 2011. Since the Sub-lease was not forfeited, Pedder
                    was entitled to a return of their bank guarantee and deposit. I dismissed
                    MKD’s claim and proceeded to hear the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I should preface my analysis by a brief
                    recount of the circumstances surrounding the counterclaim. It is immediately
                    obvious that there was no guarantee that JTC would have consented to an
                    extension of the Sub-lease beyond 31 March 2012. Accordingly, Pedder could not
                    claim a definite loss arising from MKD’s alleged breach of cl 2A(b) of the
                    Sub-lease. Pedder’s claim was essentially that MKD had not even attempted
                    to seek JTC’s approval for an extension of the Sub-lease beyond 31 March
                    2012 and that they <em>could have</em> continued their
                    Sub-lease of the Premises. However, Pedder had not specifically pleaded the loss
                    of a chance to continue the Sub-lease of the Premises. A claim for loss of
                    chance, however, was open to Pedder on the facts which were pleaded. All Pedder
                    would be doing, by amending its pleadings, would be to bring them in line with
                    the evidence adduced. I noted the <em>dicta</em> of
                    V K Rajah JC in <em>Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 594 (at [86]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In cases where the facts raised in the proposed amendments have been
                        addressed during the evidence and submissions and, particularly, where the
                        opposing side has also had an opportunity to address the very same points,
                        there can hardly ever be any real prejudice. The pleadings, in such
                        instances, merely formalise what is already before the court. As a matter of
                        fairness, allowing amendments at a late stage should usually go hand in hand
                        with granting leave to the other party to adduce further evidence, if
                        necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I found that this was precisely such a case; MKD was fully aware of
                    the substance of Pedder’s case on loss of a chance although it had not
                    been formally pleaded. MKD would suffer no prejudice from my giving leave to
                    amend. In the circumstances, I exercised my power under O 20 r 8 of
                    the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) and
                    invited Pedder to amend its counterclaim to include loss of a chance. I also
                    gave the parties liberty to apply to adduce further evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">MKD’s alleged breach of cl 2A(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Clause 2A(b) of the Sub-lease reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">According to the present JTC handbook on subletting, there will be a 50%
                        subletting cap on GFA [<em>ie</em>, Gross Floor Area]
                        with effect from 1 January 2012. The Lessor will use its best endeavour
                            [<em>sic</em>] to obtain approval from JTC to
                        continue to lease the 100% GFA of the Demised Premises to Lessee, or as much
                        GFA of the Demises [<em>sic</em>] Premises as allowed
                        by JTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The operative words in cl 2A(b), when it comes
                    to MKD’s obligations, are “best endeavour to obtain approval from
                    JTC”. The question is thus whether MKD used its best endeavours to obtain
                    approval from JTC for as much GFA of the Premises as could be allowed.
                    MKD’s argument was that it had used its best endeavours to obtain the
                    necessary approval by proposing the Novation Agreements and entering into
                    negotiations with Mapletree and JTC to permit that novation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Loh admitted, without demur, that MKD (or more
                    accurately, Mapletree) never applied to JTC for permission to continue the
                        Sub-lease.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The simple truth was that MKD
                    had never considered applying for approval for the continuation of the Sub-lease
                    in respect of 50% of the GFA of the Premises. As far as MKD was concerned,
                    Novation Agreements were the best deal which could have been made for a
                    continuation of the Sub-Lease. This is clear from MKD’s treatment of the
                    Sub-lease as forfeited. The question is not, however, whether MKD had
                    subjectively used its best endeavours to secure the continuation of the
                    Sub-lease, but whether “best endeavour” under cl 2A(b) of the
                    Sub-lease objectively required MKD to apply to JTC, via Mapletree, for
                    permission to continue the Sub-lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Clause 2A(b) refers generally to
                    “obtain[ing] approval from JTC”. A  plain reading of
                    this indicates that best endeavours would include an application to JTC for its
                    approval for the continued sub-letting of the Premises. MKD has argued that
                    approval would have to be sought from both Mapletree and JTC. However, as noted
                    at [5] above, Mapletree had supported the continuation of the Sub-lease and,
                    although its consent was required for the continuation of the Sub-lease under cl
                    3.19.3 of the MKD Lease, this consent was not to be unreasonably withheld. It is
                    further noted that Mapletree had previously agreed to the 49-month Sub-lease and
                    had been keen to proceed on the basis of the Sub-lease rather than a novation in
                    its e-mail to MKD dated 14 March 2011. There is no evidence that Mapletree had
                    any intention to withhold its consent. The major factor for continuation of the
                    Sub-lease was and always had been JTC’s, and not Mapletree’s,
                    approval. Mapletree’s approval appeared to have been taken almost as a
                    given by both parties at all material times until further submissions on the
                    counterclaim. In my view, there was actually a high chance of Mapletree giving
                    its consent so long as JTC was also willing to approve the continuation of the
                    Sub-lease whether in respect of the whole or part of the Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In view of the clear language, it would be
                    untenable to interpret cl 2A(b) as applying only to an attempt to novate
                    the agreement, but not an attempt to get approval from JTC for a continued
                    sub-lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     This natural reading of cl 2A is supported by
                    the context of the agreement. When cl 2A was inserted, the idea of novation had
                    already been birthed. However, this was not known to Pedder. Pedder had not
                    attended any of the meetings in which novation was discussed. There was no
                    mention of novation or any other alternative means of obtaining JTC approval in
                    any of the written correspondence between Pedder and MKD prior to the e-mail of
                    15 June 2011 forwarding the Supplemental Deed to Pedder. This corroborates
                    Pauline’s account that novation had not been mentioned prior to 15 June
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The insertion of cl 2A was
                    accompanied by an e-mail from Loh referring to JTC’s consent for one year
                    of <em>subletting</em>. I also noted the e-mail from
                    Mapletree dated 14 March 2011 (see [8] above), which asked that MKD proceed on
                    the basis of the Sub-lease and not the novation. At the time of insertion of cl
                    2A, an objective assessment of the agreement reveals that the parties would have
                    had in mind an application to JTC for approval of a continued <em>sub-lease</em> and not a lease in another form. Pedder could not have
                    agreed that “best endeavour” would be limited to seeking
                    JTC’s approval for novation, as it was not even aware that novation was on
                    the table.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I find that cl 2A(b) of the Sub-lease did
                    oblige MKD to make an application to JTC for continued <em>sub-lease</em> of the Premises, and that it was not enough for MKD to
                    have sought approval for a novation. It should be noted that cl 2A(c) would have
                    obliged Pedder to continue the Sub-lease at less than 100% GFA if the terms and
                    conditions were no less favourable than the Sub-lease terms and conditions. In
                    fact, cl 2A(b) anticipated this situation by stating that JTC policy from 1
                    January 2012 was to impose a 50% subletting cap, and adding the proviso that MKD
                    would use its best endeavours to obtain approval for “as much GFA of the
                    Demises [<em>sic</em>] Premises as allowed by JTC”.
                    Two of Pedder’s three directors, Ang and Heng Lye Chun (“Ms
                    Heng”), also testified that Pedder would have continued the Sub-lease at
                    50% of the GFA of the Premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> At the material time,
                    Tan and Pauline had written to MKD to ask that MKD apply for JTC’s
                    approval for the continued <em>sub-lease</em> (see [14] and
                    [15] above) despite the fact that they must have been aware from the start that
                    there was a chance they would not have been able to have 100% of the GFA of the
                    Premises. I thus give little weight to MKD’s argument that the
                    proposed arrangement via the Novation Agreements was the only “best
                    endeavour” that MKD could have taken at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Accordingly, I find that MKD’s failure
                    to apply to JTC for its approval to continue the Sub-lease beyond 31 March 2012
                    was a breach of cl 2A(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether MKD’s breach resulted in loss to Pedder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Both parties accepted that it was extremely
                    unlikely that JTC would have granted approval for continuation of the Sub-lease
                    of 100% of the Premises. The claim for damages proceeded on the basis that there
                    was a chance that 50% of the GFA of the Premises would have been approved and
                    that Pedder would have continued to sublet the Premises on that basis. MKD
                    attempted to argue that Pedder would not have accepted 50% of the GFA and
                    accordingly JTC’s approval, even if granted, would not have resulted in
                    the Sub-lease continuing. However, as I have already observed (at [39] above),
                    cl 2A(c) would have obliged Pedder to accept a continuation of the
                    Sub-lease even if approval had been granted for only 50% of the GFA. During
                    cross-examination on the counterclaim, Ang was pressed on whether he would have
                    accepted 50% of the GFA if offered. He was adamant that whichever 50%
                    of   the Premises were offered, Pedder would have accepted it. In
                    the circumstances, the real question was whether JTC would have granted approval
                    for 50% of the GFA of the Premises, and <em>not</em>
                    whether the procurement of such approval would have resulted in a continuation
                    of the Sub-lease. The problem is that no evidence was adduced as to the
                    likelihood, or otherwise, of JTC’s granting such approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The fact that the loss cannot be easily
                    quantified does not make the existence of such loss uncertain. There is
                    authority that damages may be awarded for loss of a chance. In <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em> [1911] 2 KB 786, the defendant breached
                    his contract with the plaintiff by failing to deliver her letter of appointment
                    on time, and refusing her request for another appointment. As a result, the
                    plaintiff lost her chance to be selected for a prize. This was held to be a
                    substantial loss, notwithstanding that the loss was based on the contingency of
                    her being selected as one of the 12 prize winners from a clutch of 50 aspiring
                    actresses. The English Court of Appeal disagreed with the defendant’s
                    contention that, since certainty would be incapable of attainment, the damages
                    for breach of contract would be unassessable. Explaining the position of the
                    court, Farwell LJ opined at 798:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the defendant has committed a breach of his contract, the damages
                        claimed are a reasonable and probable consequence of that breach, and loss
                        has accrued to the plaintiff at the time of <em>acti</em>on. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>McRae v Commonwealth
                        Disposals Commission</em> (1951) 84 CLR 377 (“<em>McRae</em>”), the defendants entered into a contract
                    with the plaintiffs for the sale of an oil tanker and its contents wrecked on a
                    reef some 100 miles north of Samarai. The tanker and its contents were sold
                    “as and where they lie with all faults” without any warranty as to
                    the condition, description, quality or otherwise. After having signed the
                    contract, the plaintiffs were unable to locate the tanker. It was subsequently
                    found that there was no such tanker in the locality at the material time. The
                    plaintiffs sued to recover damages for breach of contract. It was held that they
                    could only recover the cost and expenses incurred in looking for the tanker but
                    not damages for loss of profit, and nominal damages were awarded. Commenting on
                    the basis of awarding damages in <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em>,
                    Dixon J and Fullager J in <em>McRae</em> opined at
                    412:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em>, if the contract had
                        been performed, the plaintiff would have had a real chance of winning the
                        prize, and it seems proper enough to say that that chance was worth
                        something. It is only in another and quite different sense that it could be
                        said here that, if the contract had been performed, the plaintiffs would
                        have had a chance of making a profit. The broken promise itself in <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em> was, in effect, “to give the
                        plaintiff a chance”: here the element of chance lay in the nature of
                        the thing contracted for itself. Here we seem to have something which cannot
                        be assessed. If there were nothing more in this case than a promise to
                        deliver a stranded tanker and a failure to deliver a stranded tanker, the
                        plaintiffs would, of course, be entitled to recover the price paid by them,
                        but beyond that, in our opinion, only nominal damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The <em>McRae</em>
                    understanding of <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em> limits the
                    principle of awarding damages for a loss of chance to the situation where the
                    chance was the object of the agreement. Harvey McGregor, <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009)
                    (“McGregor”) at para 8-039 offered a similar opinion after
                    reviewing a line of cases on loss of chance and, most notably, cases on
                    solicitors’ negligence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The circumstances in which the law is prepared to recognise the loss of a
                        chance as itself an identifiable head of loss, as itself constituting
                        compensatable damage, are when the provision of the chance is the object of
                        the duty that has been breached. This comes out clearly in <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em> itself where Fletcher Moulton LJ
                        emphasised that “the very object and scope of the contract were to
                        give the plaintiff the chance of being selected a prize-winner”. An
                        alternative formulation is that it can be said that <em>the
                            essence of the breach of duty is that it deprives the claimant of the
                            chance or opportunity of securing a favourable outcome</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     
          <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em>
                    was approved locally in <em>Straits Engineering Contracting Pte
                        Ltd v Merteks Pte Ltd</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 864 (“<em>Straits Engineering</em>”). The plaintiff in <em>Straits Engineering</em> contracted with the defendant for
                    the latter to sell all the shares in its wholly owned subsidiary. The defendant
                    subsequently insisted on a sale on the basis of a clean company without trade
                    debtors and trade creditors. The trial judge found that there was no agreement
                    for such a basis and that the defendant had breached the agreement when it
                    refused to sell the shares in question. He went on to find that it was clear to
                    both parties that the object of the plaintiff’s acquisition of the shares
                    was for it to expand its business. Accordingly, by its breach, the defendant had
                    deprived the plaintiff of a chance to expand its business. Damages were awarded
                    for the loss of a chance to make profits from an expansion of business. The
                    Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the trial judge to award damages for loss
                    of a chance of making a profit, but reduced the quantum of damages because of
                    the trial judge’s omission to take into account certain factors which
                    would have reduced the plaintiff’s profit projections.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It is unclear whether <em>Straits Engineering</em> actually expanded the principle in <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em> as understood in <em>McRae</em> and McGregor. While the Court of Appeal in <em>Straits Engineering</em> distinguished <em>McRae</em> after quoting its comments on the limited application of
                        <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em> (at [43] above), <em>McRae</em> was distinguished only on its facts; the Court of
                    Appeal observed that there was no evidence as to the state, condition,
                    description, quality or otherwise of the object lost in <em>McRae</em> and an additional burden of uncertainty existed in
                        <em>McRae</em> which was not present in <em>Straits Engineering</em>. In <em>ABC
                        Supermarket Pte Ltd v Kosma Holdings Pte Ltd</em> [2005] SGHC 44, Kan
                    Ting Chiu J, commenting on <em>Straits Engineering</em>,
                    found (at [32]) that the distinction between <em>McRae</em>
                    and <em>Straits Engineering</em> was not about where the
                    element of chance lay (see [43] above). Instead, the distinction was one between
                    a real chance and a mere chance. In <em>McRae</em>, there
                    was only a mere chance of recovering the object lost, whereas in <em>Straits Engineering</em>, there was a real chance of doing
                    so. On this view, the Court of Appeal made no comment on the <em>McRae</em> interpretation of the <em>Chaplin v
                        Hicks</em> principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The chance to make a profit was not the
                    express object of the agreement in <em>Straits
                        Engineering</em>. The object of the agreement was the acquisition of
                    the shares. The chance to make a profit flowed from the loss of the shares
                    contracted for. However, the Court of Appeal looked behind the apparent purpose
                    of the agreement to its true purpose. The Court of Appeal reasoned (at [53]) as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Here, there was a contract for the sale and purchase of all the shares
                        of an operating company having a net worth of some $2.27m and holding a
                        leasehold site with a seafront, which the respondents found would meet their
                        needs commercially. The respondents and their related companies were
                        involved in shipping business and the company with its facilities would
                        probably offer a complementary role to the business of the respondents and
                        their related companies. The trial judge found, and we agree with him, that
                        on acquiring the company the capacity of the respondents to undertake repair
                        jobs would be substantially enhanced and the seafront of the site which the
                        company had would be of great advantage, and that <em>the
                            appellants knew that the respondents were seeking to acquire the company
                            to expand its business</em>. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     While the object of the agreement was not
                    expressly to enable the plaintiff to make a profit from an expansion of
                    business, the Court of Appeal found that “the appellants knew that the
                    respondents were seeking to acquire the company to expand its business”.
                    In other words, the Court of Appeal was ready to find that the <em>true purpose and ultimate object</em> of the agreement in
                        <em>Straits Engineering</em> was the expansion of the
                    plaintiff’s business, which was synonymous with the making of profits.
                    Profits were the easiest way to measure the loss of a chance of business
                    expansion. On this reading of <em>Straits Engineering</em>,
                    the <em>McRae</em> and McGregor understanding of <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em> was implicitly adopted, <em>viz</em>, that loss of a chance as a compensable head of
                    damage applies where the object or purpose of the agreement or clause breached
                    is the chance being claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     A contrary view could also be advanced that
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Straits Engineering</em> in
                    effect extended the principle in <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em>,
                    as understood in <em>McRae</em>, when it permitted recovery
                    for loss of a chance to make a profit even when the object of the contract was a
                    block of shares in the operating company. It will be recalled that in <em>McRae</em>, the court held that apart from wasted costs and
                    expenses incurred in searching for the tanker, the plaintiffs could not recover
                    damages for loss of profit, but only nominal damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Whether one takes a wide or narrow view of
                        <em>Straits Engineering</em>, I find that damages
                    can be awarded for loss of a chance arising from a breach of cl 2A(b) of the
                    Sub-lease. Given that cl 2A(b) was about MK using its best endeavours to secure
                    approval for continued subletting of as much GFA of the Premises as <em>might be</em> allowed by JTC (see [36] to [39] above), I find
                    that its object was to give Pedder the chance to remain in the Premises to the
                    maximum GFA which JTC would be willing to allow. In other words, the subject
                    matter of the counterclaim is the very thing which was contracted for under cl
                    2A(b) of the Sub-lease. It follows that the losses which Pedder can claim in the
                    present case is limited to the value of the chance to continue the Sub-Lease up
                    to the maximum GFA which JTC would have permitted. MKD argued that the object of
                    cl 2A(b) was uncertain as there would be no certainty as to which part of the
                    Premises would be sublet upon renewal of the Sub-lease with only 50% of the GFA
                    of the Premises. I disagree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The object of cl 2A(b) was to give Pedder a
                    chance to renew the Sub-lease. The eventual intricacies of what that would
                    involve, including the drawing up of a new agreement detailing the specific part
                    of the Premises which would form the new demised premises, comes <em>after</em> the obligation to seek Mapletree and JTC’s
                    approval is discharged and not before. The fact that the exact shape of the
                    agreement for a renewed lease could not be certain if only 50% of the GFA of the
                    Premises was allowed cannot change the clear object of cl 2A(b), which was to
                    allow for a chance to make such an agreement to continue the
                Sub-lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In <em>Chaplin v
                        Hicks</em>, Vaughan Williams LJ dealt with the question of uncertainty
                    as follows (at 791–792):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It was said that the plaintiff’s chance of winning a prize
                        turned on such a number of contingencies that it was impossible for any one,
                        even after arriving at the conclusion that the plaintiff had lost her
                        opportunity by the breach, to say that there was any assessable value of
                        that loss. It is said that in a case which involves so many contingencies it
                        is impossible to say what was the plaintiff’s pecuniary loss. I am
                        unable to agree with that contention. I agree that the presence of all the
                        contingencies upon which the gaining of the prize might depend makes the
                        calculation not only difficult but incapable of being carried out with
                        certainty or precision. The proposition is that, whenever the contingencies
                        on which the result depends are numerous and difficult to deal with, it is
                        impossible to recover any damages for the loss of the chance or opportunity
                        of winning the prize. In the present case I understand that there were fifty
                        selected competitors, of whom the plaintiff was one, and twelve prizes so
                        that the average chance of each competitor was about one in four. Then it is
                        said that the questions which might arise in the minds of the judges are so
                        numerous that it is impossible to say that the case is one in which it is
                        possible to apply the doctrine of averages at all. I do not agree with the
                        contention that, if certainty is impossible of attainment, the damages for a
                        breach of contract are unassessable. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... But from first to last there were, as there are now, many cases in
                        which it was difficult to apply definite rules. In the case of a breach of a
                        contract for the delivery of goods the damages are usually supplied by the
                        fact of there being a market in which similar goods can be immediately
                        bought, and the difference between the contract price and the price given
                        for the substituted goods in the open market is the measure of damages; that
                        rule has been always recognized. Sometimes, however, there is no market for
                        the particular class of goods; but no one has ever suggested that, because
                        there is no market, there are no damages. In such a case the jury must do
                        the best they can, and it may be that the amount of their verdict will
                        really be a matter of guesswork. But the fact that damages cannot be
                        assessed with certainty does not relieve the wrong-doer of the necessity of
                        paying damages for his breach of contract. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As the object of the Sub-lease, and in
                    particular cl 2A(b), was not directly or indirectly to ensure profit for Pedder
                    from use of the Premises, Pedder’s loss of profits would be too remote to
                    be claimed. In any event, Ms Heng admitted on the stand that it would be
                    impossible to project Pedder’s future profits (or losses) as it was a
                    fairly new company and had only been operating effectively for nine
                        months.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> I, therefore, reject MKD’s contention
                    that Pedder’s claim in damages for loss of chance should have been the
                    loss of an opportunity to make profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I now turn to whether the breach of cl 2A(b)
                    led to the loss of a chance claimed. In <em>Asia Hotel
                        Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 661 (“<em>Starwood”</em>), the Court
                    of Appeal set out (at [139]) a two stage enquiry to determine if there had
                    been a loss of a chance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... At the end of the day, in a case like the present, two questions
                        should be asked and answered. First, did the breach on the part of the
                        defendant cause the plaintiff to lose a chance to acquire an asset or a
                        benefit? Second, was the chance lost a real or substantial one; or putting
                        it another way, was it speculative? ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In <em>Justlogin Pte Ltd v
                        Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 425, Tay
                    Yong Kwang J clarified (at [38]) that for cases of loss of a chance,
                    “[w]hat we are concerned with is the loss of a chance of a favourable
                    outcome rather than the favourable outcome itself”. In other words, at
                    this stage of the enquiry, it would not matter if Pedder’s chance of
                    obtaining JTC’s approval were not proven on the balance of probabilities
                    so long as this chance was a “real or substantial
                one”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The first limb of the test is whether the
                    breach of cl 2A(b) of the Sub-lease caused Pedder to lose the chance to acquire
                    the benefit of a continuation of the Sub-lease. MKD’s refusal to apply to
                    sublet the Premises for a term beyond 31 March 2012 resulted in Pedder having
                        <em>no chance</em> to continue the Sub-lease. Pedder
                    thus lost its chance to remain in the Premises (albeit with a lower GFA) and the
                    first limb of the <em>Starwood</em> test is made
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The second limb of the test requires a
                    determination of whether the chance lost was “real or
                    substantial”, or merely “speculative”. In Starwood, the
                    Court of Appeal stated (at [137]) that “what would constitute a real or
                    substantial chance need not be proved on the balance of probabilities”.
                    The Court of Appeal then went on to cite Stuart-Smith LJ in <em>Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons</em> [1995] 1 WLR
                    1602 at 1611 and 1614:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Mr Jackson submitted that the plaintiffs can only succeed if in fact
                            tha<em>t chance o</em>f success can be rated at
                        over 50 per cent ... there is no reason in principle why it should be
                        so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… in my judgment, the plaintiff must prove as a matter of causation
                        that he has <em>a real or substantial chance as opposed
                            to</em> a speculative one. If he succeeds in doing so, the
                        evaluation of the chance is part of the assessment of the quantum of damage,
                        the range lying somewhere between something that just qualifies as real or
                        substantial on the one hand and near certainty on the other. I do not think
                        that it is helpful to seek to lay down in percentage terms what the lower
                        and upper ends of the bracket should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In other words, a real or substantial chance
                    could even be rated at or below a 50% chance. However, where the chance is rated
                    at a point so low as to be <em>speculative</em>, the loss
                    of a chance claim would be precluded. Accordingly, I reject MKD’s
                    contention that Pedder must fail in its counterclaim simply because Pedder could
                    not prove that it <em>would have</em> got JTC’s
                    approval for a renewal of the Sub-lease. A 100% chance, or chance approximating
                    to 100%, is not required to show that there was a real or substantial chance of
                    a particular occurrence. There is no specific percentage threshold where a
                    chance crosses into the speculative; this is a matter of common sense which I
                    find is resolved in favour of Pedder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The JTC subletting guide, which both parties
                    made reference to, states that a 50% GFA subletting cap is the “permitted
                    sublet area”, advertising openly that tenants “may sublet”
                    JTC premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Clause 2A(b) likewise referred to
                    this 50% GFA subletting cap, implicitly assuming that there was a real chance of
                    the Sub-lease being approved for up to 50% of GFA. The letter dated 25 March
                    2011 from JTC which granted approval for subletting of the Premises for the
                    initial year also suggested that a renewal of the Sub-lease was a real
                    possibility so long as consent was sought via the updated Online Subletting
                    Application Form. JTC had written to Mapletree:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    Should you wish to increase the Permitted Sublet
                            Area, or renew your subletting upon expiry, you are required to seek our
                            consent by submitting an updated Online Subletting Application Form no
                            later than two weeks before the Subletting Term expires. ...<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">I find that, as a matter of common sense, there was a real
                    possibility (or a possibility which was more than speculative) of approval for
                    continuation of the Sub-lease for up to 50% of the GFA of the
                Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Accordingly, I find that the loss of chance
                    doctrine applies and that Pedder had lost a chance to continue the Sub-lease for
                    up to 50% of the GFA of the Premises, for which Pedder is entitled to claim
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The quantum of damages for Pedder’s loss of a chance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The standard measure for calculating the
                    general loss of a sub-lease arising from wrongful termination or eviction is the
                    rental value of the premises less the contractual rent which would have fallen
                    to be paid in the future multiplied over the unexpired term (see McGregor at
                    para 23-015).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The GFA is stated to be 20,124 square metres
                    which converts to 216,614.73 square feet. The contractual rent is $162,398 per
                    month so that the rent per square foot is $0.7497, rounded up to $0.75 per
                    square foot. The unexpired term is 37 months. The loss of a chance of getting
                    the continued Sub-lease is a function of the general loss of the Sub-lease and
                    may be calculated as a percentage of the standard measure for general loss of
                    the Sub-lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The rental value of the Premises is taken from
                    the rental which the current lessee, Sagawa Express Singapore Pte Ltd
                    (“Sagawa”), pays, <em>viz</em>, $1 per
                    square foot. Pedder claimed that $1 per square foot is an under-estimation of
                    the true value of the Premises, as the current lessee pays additional fees and
                    charges which were not borne by Pedder in the Sub-lease. These include
                    outgoings, quit rent, conservancy charges, and property tax (cl 3.24). The
                    payment of property tax and JTC land rent by the new sub-tenant Sagawa is an
                    additional charge not present in the Sub-lease between Pedder and MKD. I accept
                    Pedder’s submission that the true value of the Premises was more than the
                    $1 per square foot Sagawa pays as monthly rent. Property tax paid by MKD from
                    January to September 2012 was $53,000 or $17,000 a month. JTC land rent adds a
                    further $0.08 per square foot charge. In total, property tax and JTC land
                    rent account for $0.16 per square foot. The true rental value of the
                    Premises was therefore $1.16 per square foot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The calculation of quantum is more complicated
                    in this case than in <em>Chaplin v Hicks</em> and <em>Straits Engineering</em>. It is undisputed that JTC’s
                    approval would have to be sought year on year. Both parties have agreed to
                    proceed on the basis of the loss of chance to acquire 50% of the demised
                    premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     There is no evidence of the percentage
                    probability of JTC granting permission for the subletting of 50% of the demised
                    premises. This is not, however, a bar to the calculation of quantum of damages.
                    This is not a case where loss is not proven. Where there is not enough evidence
                    to enable the loss to be precisely quantified, the court may assess the damages
                    as best as it can based on the available evidence. As stated by <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 31st
                    Ed, 2012) at para 26-015:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that damages are difficult to assess does not disentitle the
                        claimant to compensation for loss resulting from the defendant’s
                        breach of contract. Where it is clear that the claimant has suffered
                        substantial loss, but the evidence does not enable it to be precisely
                        quantified, <em>the court will assess damages as best it can
                            on the available evidence</em>. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     This approach was endorsed in <em>Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Tan Chin Seng</em> [2005] 4
                    SLR(R) 351. In that case, the court had concerns over the reliability of the
                    evidence provided for the purposes of assessment of damages. The chief evidence
                    provided was the club index (or sales data), but there was no evidence as to
                    whether the value of transacted memberships were correctly reported or any proof
                    of a statistical trend because of the low volume of recorded transactions. The
                    court held that “the sales data [were] nevertheless the best thing we
                    have got” and calculated the loss based on the sales data,
                    notwithstanding concerns as to reliability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Particularly in a case of loss of chance, the
                    damages which are awarded would not reach the same level of precision as other
                    assessments for which there are no contingencies. As opined by L P Thean JA
                    on behalf of the Court of Appeal in <em>Straits
                        Engineering</em> at [43]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under this head of damages the amount awarded is unavoidably a lump sum
                        which, in the opinion of a trial judge, is fair and reasonable, after taking
                        into account various contingencies. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I accept Pedder’s submission that the
                    chances of getting JTC’s approval for 50% of the GFA of the Premises were
                    more than fair. I have already observed (at [59] above) that the JTC subletting
                    guide and the letter dated 25 March 2011 granting formal approval for 100% of
                    the GFA of the Premises indicate that there was a reasonable prospect of
                    approval being granted for 50% of the GFA of the Premises or less. There is
                    nothing in these documents, however, to suggest that approval for 50% of the
                    Premises was a foregone conclusion. I was therefore unable to accept
                    Pedder’s submission that the chance of JTC approval should notionally be
                    100%. While I agree that it would be difficult to assign a value to the chance
                    of JTC’s approval, I find that such an endeavour must be made, given that
                    we are in the realm of chance and the assignment of a 100% chance as a proxy for
                    a “more than good” chance would make rubbish of the notion of
                    chance. I have also found at [36] above that there was a high chance that
                    Mapleree would give its consent so long as JTC was also willing to approve the
                    continuation of the Sub-lease. I find that a 60% chance in the round of MKD
                    getting JTC’s approval and Mapletree’s consent for the continuation
                    of the Sub-lease is a fair and reasonable probability. This approval would have
                    to be sought year on year, and each time there would be a 60% chance of success.
                    The final month’s extension may be ignored as it would seem unlikely that
                    either party would consider such an extension worth the effort of an
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The value of damages for loss of chance to
                    obtain 50% GFA of the Premises for the first year of extension is the annual
                    value of the rent less the contractual value of the rent multiplied over the 50%
                    GFA over a 12-month period, with a discount for the fact that there is only a
                    60% chance of success. It is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60% chance x 50% (GFA) x (true rental value – contractual value) x
                        12 months</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">= value of the loss of chance to rent 50% of the demised premises for an
                        additional year</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">0.6 x 0.5 (216,614.73) x ($1.16 – $0.75) x 12 = <b>$319,723.33</b></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The value of damages for loss of chance to
                    obtain 50% GFA of the Premises for the second year will be calculated in the
                    same way. The only difference is that approval for the second year is contingent
                    on approval for the first year, and thus the percentage chance must be
                    compounded to take into account the contingent probability. The following
                    calculation would apply:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60% chance x 60% chance x 50% (GFA) x (true rental value –
                        contractual value) x 12 months</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">= value of the loss of chance to rent 50% of the demised premises for an
                        additional year</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     (0.6)<sup>2</sup> x 0.5
                    (216,614.73) x ($1.16 – $0.75) x 12 = <b>$191,833.99</b> The value of damages for loss of chance to
                    obtain 50% GFA of the Premises for the third year must similarly take into
                    account the contingent probability of approval in the first and second years.
                    The following calculation would apply:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60% chance x 60% chance x 60% chance x 50% (GFA) x (rental value –
                        contractual value) x 12 months</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">= value of the loss of chance to rent 50% of the demised premises for an
                        additional year</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     (0.6)<sup>3</sup> x 0.5
                    (216,614.73) x ($1.16 – $0.75) x 12 = <b>$115,100.39</b>. The cumulative damages for this loss of a
                    chance is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Value of damages for first year + value of damages for second year + value
                        of damages for third year</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">= total cumulative damages</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">$319,723.33 + $191,833.99 + $115,100.39 = <b>$626,657.71</b></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Pedder also claimed “apportioned wasted
                    expenses for moving in and out” of the Premises. There is no basis for
                    the recovery of such claim. If Pedder recovers for the loss of the bargain, it
                    would be inconsistent that it should, in addition, recover for expenses of
                    moving into the Premises which were necessarily incurred by Pedder for its
                    attainment. Likewise, the expenses of moving out were inevitable in any event as
                    the Sub-lease had to come to an end eventually even if it lasted all of 49
                    months. Pedder’s claim for recovery of such expenses is therefore
                    denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     For the reasons given above, I dismissed the
                    main claim for forfeiture of the Sub-lease and now allow the counterclaim for
                    damages for breach of cl 2A(b) of the Sub-lease resulting in the loss of a
                    chance to continue the Sub-lease at 50% of the GFA of the
                Premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In consequence, I awarded MKD $173,765.86 in
                    rent arrears owed to it for the month of October 2011 while the Sub-lease was
                    still subsisting, and directed that MKD return Pedder’s banker’s
                    guarantee and deposit for the Sub-lease. I now award $626,657.71 in damages to
                    Pedder for loss of a chance to continue the Sub-lease at 50% of the GFA of the
                    Premises arising from MKD’s breach of cl 2A(b) of the
                Sub-lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
