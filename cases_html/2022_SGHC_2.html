The first is contractual, and stems from a contract, executed on 8 February 2018, for the provision of consultancy services relating to an initial coin offering (“ICO”) (the “Contract”). Briefly, ICOs are a means of raising funds by offering to the public, cryptocurrency tokens. In some ways, an ICO is analogous to an initial public offering of shares, and for present purposes, it is adequate to think of such ICO-related consultancy services as being <span class="font-italic">loosely</span> comparable to some of the work a capital markets practice team might do, or engage third parties to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The consultant who provided these services was one Gravitas Holdings Pte Ltd (“GHPL”). The Defendant, Invictus Group Pte Ltd, was the recipient of GHPL’s services; it is in the business of providing an e-platform for businesses to engage in business-to-business transactions. Before going further, however, I must call to attention that GHPL is <span class="font-italic">not</span> the Plaintiff in this matter. The Plaintiff, Gravitas <span class="font-italic">International Associates</span> Pte Ltd, purports – by virtue of a deed of assignment (the “Deed”) – to be the proper plaintiff on the grounds that it is the assignee of all of GHPL’s “rights, benefits, interests, claims and titles”

</div> The breached contract in question was a contract of employment entered between GHPL and one Stefano Virgilli (“Mr Virgilli”) (the “Employment Contract”). On the Plaintiff’s account, Mr Virgilli was an employee of GHPL and, in that capacity, had performed work on behalf of the Plaintiff for the Defendant pursuant to the Contract. In the course of working with Mr Virgilli, the Plaintiff avers, the Defendant caused him to breach his Employment Contract with GHPL “by entering into a service or consultancy agreement with [him] sometime in March 2018”.

</div> Thus, it also asserts that it is the proper party in this tortious action. Second, the Plaintiff brought a separate suit against Mr Virgilli in respect of disputes stemming from the Employment Contract. Kwek Mean Luck JC has rendered judgment on that matter (see <span class="font-italic">Gravitas International Associates Pte Ltd v</span> <span class="font-italic">Stefano </span><span class="font-italic">Virgilli</span> HC/S 755/2020 (22 July 2021) (General Division of the High Court) (“<span class="font-italic">Gravitas International </span><span class="font-italic">v Virgilli</span>”)), and where necessary, I will refer to his decision insofar as it bears on the case before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Defendant’s responses to these claims are relatively straightforward. In respect of both, the Defendant’s overarching case is that the Plaintiff simply is not the proper party. As regards the former, the Defendant avers that the contract between it and GHPL was not validly assigned.

</div> This is the starting point of the Defendant’s case and the Plaintiff must therefore prove that the work in respect of which it claims unpaid fees as an assignee, was performed. It also advances certain positive defences, but I will address these, if necessary, in due course. This brings me to the defence to the claim in tort for inducing Mr Virgilli’s breach of the Employment Contract with GHPL. On this action, the Defendant simply refutes having knowledge of the legal relationship between Mr Virgilli and GHPL.

Clause 8.3 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Neither Party may assign</span> any of its rights under this Agreement <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">without the prior consent of the other Party</span>, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided.

It is unclear what was to follow the word “provided” at the end of the first sentence. “Provided” is a conjunction which precedes a qualification of the clause before it. For example, “which shall not be withheld unreasonably; provided <span class="font-italic">the assigning Party gives at least two weeks’ notice of its intention to assign</span>”. Here however, the second sentence does not add any qualification to the first. Therefore, it is likely that the inclusion of “provided” was simply a typological error. This is the most plausible account of why it even appears in cl 8.3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Clauses which prohibit assignment are common in boilerplate contracts, especially consultancy contracts which involve some degree of personalisation in the services to be rendered thereunder.

I invited parties to put forth the original boilerplate clause, but they were unable to assist me.

</div>
</div> I will therefore approach cl 8.3 as if the word “provided” was not there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 However, before examining the consequence of <span class="font-italic">this</span> clause in particular, it is necessary to explain the nature of non-assignment clauses generally, how to analyse them, and the potential consequences they may have.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The effect of non-assignment clauses: A matter of interpretation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The leading case on this topic is the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd and another appeal </span>[1994] 1 AC 85 (“<span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>”). Lord Browne-Wilkinson, who gave the reasoning of the court, accepted that the consequence of a non-assignment clause depends on the construction of the contract (at 104D–105D). In considering the possible constructions, he referred to a case note by Professor Roy Goode on <span class="font-italic">Helstan</span><span class="font-italic"> Securities Ltd v Hertfordshire County Council</span> [1978] 3 All ER 262 (“<span class="font-italic">Helstan</span><span class="font-italic"> Securities</span>”): “Inalienable Rights?” (1979) 42(5) MLR 553–557. Professor Goode’s analysis of the facts of <span class="font-italic">Helstan</span><span class="font-italic"> Securities</span> is not relevant for present purposes. What <span class="font-italic">was</span> significant was his astute observation that non-assignment clauses are “capable of at least four alternative interpretations” (at 554).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 First, as a personal undertaking not to assign, the breach of which gives rise to a claim for damages. Second, as precluding, and thus invalidating the assignment of <span class="font-italic">rights to </span>performance under the contract. Third, as precluding, and thus invalidating not only the assignment of rights to performance but also any <span class="font-italic">fruits of</span> performance. Last, as a condition of the contract, the breach of which is repudiatory. Lord Browne-Wilkinson accepted this classification and added that, although not a possibility considered by Professor Goode, it is hypothetically possible for a non-assignment clause to invalidate the assignment of rights to future performance in a subsisting contract, but not the fruits which have already accrued for performance rendered (at 105). This would fall somewhere between the second and third categories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 For completeness, I note that the approach which their Lordships took towards non-assignment clauses in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> has been accepted in Singapore, though not yet by the Court of Appeal. In <span class="font-italic">Total English Learning Global Pte Ltd v Kids Counsel Pte Ltd</span> [2014] SGHC 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Total English</span>”), Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) remarked, “Although [counsel] urged me to depart from the English position set out in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens v </span><span class="font-italic">Lenesta</span>, there was no reason to suggest why the legal reasoning adopted therein would be inapplicable to the local context” (at [64]). In <span class="font-italic">Arris Solutions, Inc v Asian Broadcasting Network (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd</span> [2017] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Arris Solutions</span>”), after noting that <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> had been applied in <span class="font-italic">Total English</span>, Simon Thorley IJ, delivering the decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court, stated the law as follows: “<span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> stands for the rule that where there is a contractual prohibition on assignment without prior consent, a purported assignment executed without obtaining such consent will be only effective as between the assignor and assignee, but will not bind the other contracting party, whose rights and obligations will remain to the assignor” (at [20]). The assignment in question was one between the first and third plaintiff, and the court, having found that the defendant’s prior written consent had not been sought for the third plaintiff’s assignment to the first plaintiff, entered judgment for the third (see [25] and [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The clause in <span class="font-italic">Arris Solutions</span> was drafted as follows: “<span class="font-italic">Neither party shall be entitled to assign</span>, transfer, and/or subcontract any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be unnecessarily withheld or delayed” [emphasis added] (at [5]). The phrase “shall not be<span class="font-italic"> entitled</span>” does seem to preclude assignability at a more fundamental level (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the second or third of Professor Goode’s categories: see [16] above), rather than merely operating, for example, as a personal undertaking not to assign (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first of Professor Goode’s categories). That being said, I should qualify that I am not expressing a general view that the use of a certain phrase or word will carry a definite legal effect. The rules of contractual interpretation are well-known and very often, a great deal turns on legal and factual context of the case. Indeed, beyond having to determine whether the terms of the non-assignment clause should be understood as a restriction on the very alienability of the chose in action itself, the types of choses in action to which the clause applies must also be determined. For example, the non-assignment clause may only prohibit the assignment of rights to performance; it may do so in respect of both rights to performance as well as rights to accrued fruits; it may even be read as prohibiting the assignment future fruits; and so on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Consider the following example. The non-assignment clause in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> itself provided that “the employer <span class="font-italic">shall not</span> without the written consent of the contractor assign this contract” [emphasis added] (at 99). It seems that the academic commentators, Ying Khai Liew, <span class="font-italic">Guest on Assignments </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Guest</span>”) at para 4-03, Marcus Smith and Nico Leslie, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Assignments</span> (OUP, 3rd Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Smith and Leslie</span>”) at para 25.05, and Gregory J Tolhurst, <span class="font-italic">The Assignment of Contractual Rights</span> (Hart Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Tolhurst</span>”) at 269–270, would interpret “shall not assign” as a promise or personal undertaking not to assign, rather than a preclusion of the power to assign. From the point of view of the plain meaning of those words, I tend to agree. It seems to me that the phrase “shall not assign” connotes a sense of <span class="font-italic">obligation</span>. It does not obviously speak to the character or attributes of the property, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the chose in action itself. In fact, if one examines the arguments in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> closely, it will be seen that counsel for <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> (an assignee), John Dyson QC (who would later become Lord Dyson), made a similar submission. He sought to distinguish the phrase “shall not assign” from firmer expressions such as “unassignable” and “non-transferable” (<span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> at 90–91), which more clearly went towards the alienability of the chose in action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Yet, the House unanimously agreed with the decision of Lord Browne-Wilkinson, who took the view that, on a <span class="font-italic">true</span> construction of the clause, its effect was to prohibit and thus invalidate non-compliant assignments (<span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> at 105). The brief facts of the first case in <span class="font-italic">Linden Garden</span>, which comprised two appeals, were as follows. The employer company was the lessee of a property. The contractor had been engaged to remove asbestos from these premises. After the works were completed, the employer found more asbestos which should have been removed. Subsequently, the employer assigned its leasehold interest to the plaintiff, and thereafter, brought an action against the contractor for damages. After the commencement of this action, the employer purported to assign to the plaintiff, without seeking the contractor’s written consent, its rights of action in the claim for damages. At first instance, the judge found that the assignment was invalid. In the Court of Appeal, the majority, comprising Nourse LJ and Sir Michael Kerr, overturned this decision (see (1992) 57 Build LR 57). They took the view that the non-assignment clause in question (see [19] above) permitted the assignment of rights to fruits arising from the contract, though it prohibited assignments (without written consent) of the right to require future performance. Thus, since the right of action to sue the contractor was a right to fruits, it could be validly assigned without consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The House of Lords rejected this distinction, and in arriving at this conclusion, they took considerable notice of the particular contractual context in which the clause appeared. Lord Browne-Wilkinson noted that, in building contracts, claims for the price are often met with cross-claims for defective performance. This being the case, if an assignee receives a right of action for defective performance, but the assignor remains liable for the price (to the contractor), his Lordship queried whether the assignor would still be able to abate payment of the price on the basis of defective performance, or whether the assignee would need to be joined in the proceedings. In light of these questions, he eventually concluded that the parties are unlikely to have intended such a “confused” state of affairs (at 105):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the context of a complicated building contract, I find it impossible to construe clause 17 as prohibiting only the assignment of rights to future performance, leaving each party free to assign the fruits of the contract. The reason for including the contractual prohibition viewed from the contractor's point of view must be that the contractor wishes to ensure that he deals, and deals only, with the particular employer with whom he has chosen to enter into a contract. Building contracts are pregnant with disputes: some employers are much more reasonable than others in dealing with such disputes. The disputes frequently arise in the context of the contractor suing for the price and being met by a claim for abatement of the price or cross-claims founded on an allegation that the performance of the contract has been defective. Say that, before the final instalment of the price has been paid, the employer has assigned the benefits under the contract to a third party, there being at the time existing rights of action for defective work. On the Court of Appeal's view, those rights of action would have vested in the assignee. Would the original employer be entitled to an abatement of the price, even though the cross-claims would be vested in the assignee? If so, would the assignee be a necessary party to any settlement or litigation of the claims for defective work, thereby requiring the contractor to deal with two parties (one not of his choice) in order to recover the price for the works from the employer? <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I cannot believe that the parties ever intended to permit such a confused position to arise</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I would, with great respect to the English Court of Appeal, agree with his Lordship. The distinction which Nourse LJ and Sir Michael Kerr sought to draw on the uncomplicated terms of the actual non-assignment clause (“shall not… assign <span class="font-italic">this contract</span>”), seems to me rather forced. On my part, I would press for a reminder to return to the beginning of Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s speech. He stated there that determining the effect of a non-assignment clause is, at its core, a question of construction. It is, as such, important to approach the issue by asking what the parties might objectively have intended by the clause, starting with its text as the “first port of call” (<span class="font-italic">Lucky Realty Co Pte Ltd v HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1069 at [2], where the Court of Appeal reiterated the importance of starting with the text of any contract).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I will simply add that this question of interpretation should be a focused one, chiefly directed at asking two successive questions. First, whether the terms of the non-assignment clause suggest that parties intended for the very alienability of the right to be restricted. Second, still referring to the terms of the clause, what type of rights does it appear to capture (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, rights to performance, rights to present or future fruits, or combinations thereof). The formulation of these two questions, in this manner, is nothing novel. It is derived from Professor Goode’s observations on the possible interpretations which can be applied to a non-assignment clause. By breaking the inquiry down into two parts, which in any event, appeared to me to address distinct issues, it is hoped that the question of interpretation is slightly more manageable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Having said the above, I am mindful that the technical complexities in this area of law, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the assignability of choses in action, make for a rather stark mismatch between the boilerplate reality of contract drafting and the underlying legal principles (as we see in this case: see [11]–[13] above). This will likely entail some difficulty in the search for what parties objectively “intended”, and it is somewhat exacerbated by the fact, as I observed at [19]–[20] above, that there is genuine room for disagreement as to the consequence of even the most basic phrases, such as “shall not assign” in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>. In my view, however, this is not an issue which can or should be resolved by the proposal of a grand conceptual scheme in a single decision. I have, in the paragraphs above, set out a general approach towards answering the question: “does <span class="font-italic">this</span> non-assignment clause prohibit <span class="font-italic">this</span> assignment”. As much turns on the specific text of the clause, the factual background of the case, as well as the relevant contractual context, there is little more that can be said by way of general guidance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interpretation of the non-assignment clause in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 With all of the above in mind, in particular, the questions posed at [23] above, there are two parts of cl 8.3 of the Contract (see [11] above) which call for interpretation. First, “Neither Party may assign”; and second, “any of its rights under this Agreement”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The phrase “Neither Party may assign” is equivalent to the phrase “The Parties may not assign”. Where the parties are all known, there is no difference between saying all of them “may not” do something, and none of them “may” do that thing. Both carry the same meaning. Hence, as it is less cumbersome, I will interpret the phrase “may not”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my view, “may not” suggests that cl 8.3 operates as a curtailment of the power of the parties to assign. To use the language of my own formulated question at [23] above, the phrase “may not” appears to me to affect the very alienability of the chose in action in question. The requirement of consent thus takes effect as a condition-precedent to a valid assignment. Such a view of the phrase “may not” is also taken by Professor Tolhurst in his text dedicated to the subject: see <span class="font-italic">Tolhurst</span> at 270. Admittedly, the phrase “may not” does not convey as strong a prohibition as the non-assignment clauses in certain other cases which have also reached this conclusion (cross-reference <span class="font-italic">Arris Solutions</span> at [18] above; also see <span class="font-italic">Hendry v </span><span class="font-italic">Chartsearch Ltd</span> [1998] CLC 1382 (“<span class="font-italic">Hendry v </span><span class="font-italic">Chartsearch</span>”) where, like <span class="font-italic">Arris Solutions</span>, the phrase “shall not be entitled to assign” was also used in the non-assignment clause). Indeed, it would not be unfair to query the difference between “shall not” – which <span class="font-italic">Guest</span>, <span class="font-italic">Smith</span><span class="font-italic"> and Leslie</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Tolhurst</span> would read as a promise not to assign – and “may not”, which as stated, <span class="font-italic">Tolhurst</span> suggests likely invalidates an assignment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The answer seems to lie in the linguistic differences between “shall” and “may”. When we say one “shall” do something, that is an obligation to act (as I suggested at [19] above); conversely, when one “shall <span class="font-italic">not</span>” do something, that is an obligation to abstain. Hence, if a person acts in contravention of a clause expressed in those terms, it would connote a breach of contract. However, when we say one “may” do something, that permits or empowers that individual to perform the act but does not oblige him to do so. By the phrase “may not”, we forbid the doing of the act, or deprive him of any power to perform that act. This has connotations of invalidity of the act rather than the breach of an obligation. This generally intuitive distinction between the meaning of the terms is, in my view, sufficient to explain the difference between “shall not” and “may not”, and therefore their differing legal consequences in relation to non-assignment clauses. That said, I am conscious that this distinction cannot be pushed too far. The context of the clause may have a greater effect on the interpretation than the natural meaning of those words, and in light of the outcome in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>, it is not unarguable to say that when a person “shall not” do something, he is deprived of the power to do that specific act, rather than being under a mere obligation to abstain from doing it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 This, however, does not pose a problem to my analysis. Indeed, the fact that the language of “shall not” can quite comfortably accommodate both the concepts of a <span class="font-italic">duty</span> as well as a restriction on one’s <span class="font-italic">power</span> is probably a useful way to reconcile the academic views of the phrase “shall not” with the actual decision in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> as I set out at [21] above. Furthermore, the force of this explanation seems supported by the fact that such re-characterisation cannot be so easily applied to the phrase “may not”. That is, recasting the phrase “may not” as an obligation to abstain seems to attract much greater dissonance between the language and the proposed concept. Obligations in contract are supposed to be, at least generally, sharp and defined; one either <span class="font-italic">must</span> or <span class="font-italic">must not</span> do a thing. The language of “may” and “may not” can, but does not comfortably encapsulate this. If, for example, in a contract for the sale of goods, I am only able to receive delivery on a specified day, and I contract with the seller for this, it is awkward to achieve this by stating in the contract that the seller “may not” deliver on any day other than my specified day. Conversely, saying he “may” deliver on that day does not create the obligation I wish to impose. Of course, we could say that he “may <span class="font-italic">only</span>” make delivery on that day, but the operative obligation is then not created by the word “may” but rather the word “only”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I do not mean to say that it is not possible for the language of “may” and “may not” to be recast in this way. My point is that doing so creates disjunction between the usual understanding of the terms and the underlying legal concepts. Thus, just as the difference in academic commentary and the outcome of <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> can be explained by the relative ease with which the phrase “shall not” can be re-characterised as a strict prohibition, I would suggest that the lack of ease in applying the same treatment to the phrase “may not” can be said to be a reasoned explanation of Professor Tolhurst’s seemingly intuitive suggestion that, “Provisions stating that a party ‘may not’ assign probably also fall within [the group of clauses drafted to negate the power to assign]” (<span class="font-italic">Tolhurst</span> at 270).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I turn then to the second phrase in cl 8.3 requiring interpretation: “any of its rights under this Agreement”. In my view, this should include <span class="font-italic">all</span> choses in action arising from the Contract. As suggested at [22] above, the first port of call is to look at the language of the provision. Nothing about the phrase “rights under this Agreement” suggest that the parties intended to distinguish between rights of performance, which are irrelevant in this suit, and rights to fruits, which <span class="font-italic">are</span> relevant. In fact, to the contrary, the rather poor drafting of cl 8.3 I highlighted at [11]–[12] above indicates that the parties probably did not have such a specific, legally precise intention upon entering the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I therefore find that the legal consequence of non-compliance with the terms of cl 8.3, specifically, failing to seek the “prior consent of the other Party”, is that the purported assignment will be invalid. On this basis, I turn to consider GHPL’s purported assignment of its “rights, benefits, interests, claims and titles” under the Contract to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The effect of failing to seek prior consent as required</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As stated at [6] above, it is not disputed that no prior consent was sought. In fact, the purported assignment – effected on 24 April 2020 –  was only brought to the Defendant’s attention on 13 August 2020, by a letter from Malcolm Tan Chambers LLC.

</div>
</div> Again, no reply was adduced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The Plaintiff relies on these letters to make the claim that, even if there were procedural defects in the assignment, they have been cured. The difficulty I have with this submission, is that the letters were all sent <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Deed was executed on 24 April 2020. No subsequent deed was re-executed after the letters were issued. If that had been the case, it could at least have been argued that the Defendant’s consent was sought, but unreasonably refused. It is difficult to say that the Defendant unreasonably refused <span class="font-italic">prior</span> consent when such consent had never been requested. Further, the letters were not even sent by GHPL, but the Plaintiff. So, they do nothing to address the issue of whether the <span class="font-italic">assignor</span>, GHPL, properly sought the prior consent of the <span class="font-italic">obligor</span>, its counterparty in the Contract, the Defendant. This is what cl 8.3 of the Contract requires (see [11] above), and the letters do not demonstrate that this has been satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Given my finding at [32], the letters, however, gives rise to a slightly more difficult question, and one which the English Court of Appeal considered, <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Hendry v </span><span class="font-italic">Chartsearch</span>. The non-assignment clause in that case provided: “The Client [Defendants] shall not be entitled to assign, licence or otherwise transfer the benefit of this Agreement whether in whole or in part without the prior written consent of Interface … Interface <span class="font-italic">shall not be entitled</span> to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement in whole or in part or to sub-contract any of obligations hereafter <span class="font-italic">without the prior written consent of the Client which shall not be unreasonably withheld</span>” [emphasis added] (at [8]). The essential facts are straightforward: Interface did not seek consent prior to assigning certain rights to the plaintiff, who was alongside his wife, the owner of Interface. The plaintiff proceeded to sue for breach of the purportedly assigned contracts. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendant had induced Interface’s employees to break their contracts of employment. On the facts of the case, Evans LJ, delivering the judgment of the court, held that, had the defendant been properly asked, it would have been entitled to reasonably refuse consent to the assignment. So, the case could be disposed of on this basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, the court’s factual decision aside, it also mooted the following question. Where an assignor does not even ask for consent, contrary to the terms of a non-assignment clause, may that assignment nevertheless be effective on the grounds that, had the consent of the obligor been sought beforehand, it could not in any event have been reasonably withheld? In light of his assessment of the facts, Evans LJ found it unnecessary to decide the point, and preferred to leave it open (at 1392–1393). He did, however, express inclination towards the view that – if consent could not have been unreasonably withheld – the assignment could be valid notwithstanding the assignor’s failure to even seek prior consent. To understand why he was so inclined, we need to examine Millett LJ’s observations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Millett LJ took the view that it is irrelevant whether consent could have been unreasonably withheld. In his terms, the matter “is not a proper subject of inquiry” (at 1393). To arrive at this view, he started from the premise that it is settled law that, if the lessor’s consent is required for an assignment, failure to obtain such consent is fatal to any assignment attempted by the lessee (at 1394). He cited <span class="font-italic">Barrow v Isaacs &amp; Son </span>[1891] 1 QB 417 and <span class="font-italic">Eastern Telegraph Co Ltd v Dent</span> [1899] 1 QB 835, and I note that there are many more authorities. For decisions following <span class="font-italic">Hendry v </span><span class="font-italic">Chartsearch</span>, see <span class="font-italic">Norwich Union Life Insurance Society v </span><span class="font-italic">Shopmoor Ltd </span>[1999] 1 WLR 531, <span class="font-italic">passim</span>; <span class="font-italic">Greymouth Gas </span><span class="font-italic">Kaimiro Ltd v GXL Royalties Ltd</span> [2011] 1 NZLR 289 at [10], Young J delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Zealand; and <span class="font-italic">Fulham Partners LLC v National Australia Bank Ltd </span>[2013] NSWCA 296 (“<span class="font-italic">Fulham Partners</span>”) at [38], Basten JA giving the delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 He then goes on to say that, although there are “significant differences” between the assignment of an interest in land, and the benefit of a contract, these differences do not bear on the validity of an assignment which fails to comply with the requirement to seek prior consent. The learned Lord Justice, in reasoning this assertion, begins with the observation that, where interests in land are concerned, the law finds repugnant and holds void, conditions against the alienation of such interests. Yet, even then, the cases (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, those cited above) have established that where a lessee fails to seek consent to assign, such consent having been covenanted for, it is “no answer” for him to say that no reasonable objection could have been made if consent had been sought (at 1394). Thus, in the case of contractual choses in action, where the law does not even object to stipulations of inalienability, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, a failure to seek consent should be fatal to the assignment. This reasoning essentially builds on that of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>. There, his Lordship held that – unlike interests in land – there is no public policy against restricting the alienability of choses (<span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> at 107):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the face of this authority, the House is being invited to change the law by holding that such a prohibition is void as contrary to public policy. For myself I can see no good reason for so doing. Nothing was urged in argument as showing that such a prohibition was contrary to the public interest beyond the fact that such prohibition renders the chose in action inalienable. Certainly in the context of rights over land the law does not favour restrictions on alienability. But even in relation to land law a prohibition against the assignment of a lease is valid. We were not referred to any English case in which the courts have had to consider restrictions on the alienation of tangible personal property, probably because there are few cases in which there would be any desire to restrict such alienation. <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the case of real property there is a defined and limited supply of the commodity, and it has been held contrary to public policy to restrict the free market. But no such reason can apply to contractual rights: there is no public need for a market in choses in action</span>. A party to a building contract, as I have sought to explain, can have a genuine commercial interest in seeking to ensure that he is in contractual relations only with a person whom he has selected as the other party to the contract. In the circumstances, I can see no policy reason why a contractual prohibition on assignment of contractual rights should be held contrary to public policy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Henry LJ took the same position as Millett LJ, though he provided an additional, more straightforward reason in support (at 1394):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The suggestion that the assignor can validly assign in breach of his contract without ever seeking prior</span> consent by asserting that, as such consent could not reasonably be refused, so it is unnecessary, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">seems to me to be a recipe to promote uncertainty and speculative litigation</span>. I prefer the simple certainty that prior consent never applied for is never withheld or refused (whether reasonably or otherwise). The burden of suing should be on the party who asserts that he is not obliged to ask for prior consent as his contract required him to because it could not reasonably be refused.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Returning then to Evans LJ’s view. He does not cast any doubt on the rule insofar as leases are concerned. However, he suggests that there is no authority which has extended the rule to the assignment of contractual rights, and that it “may be arguable that a debtor cannot object to the validity of an assignment on the ground that he was not asked for his consent, when he could not reasonably have refused it” (at 1392).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I can see the intuitive appeal of Evans LJ’s suggestion. After all, if the assignment would not have failed had an ostensibly minor procedural step been taken, it seems harsh to deny a plaintiff the standing it needs to bring a claim, particularly if it is meritorious. This harshness may be amplified further in cases where the assignee no longer exists, or is simply disinterested in re-effecting a fresh, compliant assignment. However, I do not think it is permissible to accept these concerns whilst also purporting to follow <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>. If we start from that position, bearing in mind <span class="font-italic">Total English</span> and <span class="font-italic">Arris Solutions</span> insofar as Singapore law is concerned, it is in my view difficult to assert on one hand that non-assignment clauses (properly interpreted) are effective in invalidating non-compliant assignments, whilst also saying on the other that it is permissible for the court to consider the hypothetical question posed by Evans LJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In this regard, I think it useful to refer to the paper of Gregory J Tolhurst and JW Carter, “Prohibitions on Assignment: A Choice to be Made” (2014) 73(3) CLJ 405–434 (“<span class="font-italic">Tolhurst</span><span class="font-italic"> and Carter</span>”). Here, the learned professors consider the two opposing views which have arisen in this area: (a) the “property view” – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that encapsulated by the judgment of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>; and (b) the “contract view” – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that which proposes that contracted prohibitions on assignment, no matter how they are framed, should operate only in the realm of contract (as promises not to assign), and not at the level of property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Preferring the latter view necessarily entails a departure from <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>, for which I am aware there is both judicial and scholarly support. In <span class="font-italic">First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC (Formerly National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC) v BP Oil International Limited </span>[2018] EWCA Civ 14 (“<span class="font-italic">First Abu Dhabi</span>”), Gloster LJ (with whom Lord Briggs and Patten LJ agreed) expressed that, had she not been constrained by the authority of <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>, she would likely have preferred the contract view (at [28]), citing an article by Professor Goode making the case therefor: “Contractual Prohibitions against Assignment” [2009] LMCLQ 300–318. Indeed, I would also regard the decisions of <span class="font-italic">Barbados Trust Co Ltd v Bank of Zambia and another</span> [2007] 2 All ER (Comm) 445 and <span class="font-italic">Don King Productions Inc v Warren and others</span> [1998] 2 All ER 608 as decisions which exemplify an unspoken discomfort with the strict, “property view” that <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> applies to non-assignment clauses. In these cases, it was held that a declaration of a trust over a chose in action, in favour of an intended assignee, can escape the effect of a non-assignment clause. Of course, these courts arrived at their decisions by interpreting the prohibitory clause in question. This seems aligned with <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>. However, given that a trust over a chose in action, <span class="font-italic">mechanically</span>, operates in the same manner as an equitable assignment (<span class="font-italic">Smith and Leslie</span> at para 25.41; though I make no remark on the far more difficult conceptual difference which has attracted the attention of an entire monograph: see CH Tham, <span class="font-italic">Understanding the Law of Assignment</span> (CUP, 2019)), the distinction seems quite vexed. The willingness of the courts in these cases to draw such fine distinctions to, ostensibly, get around the consequences of <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> might warrant at least, closer examination of the Lords’ decision, if and when the applicability of <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> goes before the Singapore Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 That said, as far as the matter before me is concerned, I – like the judges in <span class="font-italic">Total English</span> and <span class="font-italic">Arris Solutions</span> – have not been presented with any reason to depart from <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> in favour, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, of<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">First Abu Dhabi</span>. Indeed, though <span class="font-italic">Tolhurst</span><span class="font-italic"> and Carter</span> argue that the “property view” should be preferred for a range of reasons, their ultimate point, as would be apparent from the title of the article, is that it is “necessary to make a clear informed choice as to the operation of provisions which prohibit assignment. That choice is not a simple one as it goes to the very heart of the law of assignment and personal property” (at 434). Without the benefit of full arguments on the issue, I am not in a position to choose between the “property view”, the “contract view”, or some other middle-of-the-road approach which Evans LJ’s inclination might be said to reflect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The consequence of this, as I alluded to at [42] above, is that I prefer the view of Millett and Henry LJJ in <span class="font-italic">Hendry v </span><span class="font-italic">Chartsearch</span>. This is consistent with <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>, which Evans LJ’s does not appear to be. It is worth noting that in <span class="font-italic">Fulham Partners</span>, the Supreme Court of New South Wales also took this view. After a brief restatement of <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span>, Basten JA suggested that if consent is not even sought, the assignment would be ineffective whether or not it was reasonably or unreasonably withheld (at [38]–[41]). Applying this to the present case, GHPL’s purported assignment to the Plaintiff of its rights under the Contract is plainly invalid as no prior consent was ever sought from the Defendant. The Plaintiff therefore has no standing to bring its contract claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Do non-assignment clauses survive termination?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This then brings me to a final point which arises because of an argument the Plaintiff makes. In essence, counsel for the Plaintiff argues that cl 8.3 is irrelevant because it does not survive the Contract’s termination. In support of this, he relies on cll 3.1 and 6.2 of the Contract which expressly provide that cll 3 and 2, respectively, shall survive termination. There is, however, no clause that preserves cl 8.3.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I do not accept this. A consequence of accepting <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> is that the inherent transferability of the chose in action created by the contract is, by the non-assignment clause, <span class="font-italic">restricted</span>. Put another way, the terms of the contract do not operate as a bar on the transferability at the level of contract, instead, it is the very proprietary character of the chose in action which is restricted. This is precisely the distinction between the “property view” of non-assignment clauses which is encapsulated by <span class="font-italic">Linden Gardens</span> and the “contract view” for which Gloster LJ expressed support in <span class="font-italic">First Abu Dhabi</span>. Thus, as it is the inherent proprietary characteristics of the chose in action which restricts transferability, it is not relevant that the Contract has ended or that the non-assignment clause “has not survived”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Validity of the assignment of the Employment Contract </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As mentioned at [4] above, the Plaintiff asserts standing in respect of its claim against the Defendant for inducing Mr Virgilli’s breach of his Employment Contract. The terms of the Deed assigning the rights under this contract from GHPL to the Plaintiff, are set out at [9] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is well-established on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Nokes</span><span class="font-italic"> v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd</span> [1940] AC 1014 that the right to receive services of an employee under a contract of employee is a personal right which cannot validly be assigned without the employee’s consent (at 1020 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Viscount Simon LC, 1026 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Atkin). One need only consult the standard texts to conclude that this position is beyond doubt (see <span class="font-italic">Tolhurst</span> at para 6.72; <span class="font-italic">Smith and Leslie</span> at para 24.12; <span class="font-italic">Guest</span> at para 4-48). I am, of course, mindful that the Plaintiff is not asserting a right to Mr Virgilli’s performance of work as an employee. However, as I will explain shortly, the inability of GHPL to assign the right to Mr Virgilli’s services as an employee, without his consent, is a crucial point which must be borne in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The right of GHPL which the Plaintiff <span class="font-italic">actually</span> asserts in the present suit is its right to bring an action for damages against the Defendant, in respect of its alleged inducement of Mr Virgilli’s breach of the Employment Contract. The parties’ submissions do not even canvass the standing of the Plaintiff to bring this tortious claim. I find this curious given that the Defendant has made much of the Plaintiff’s lack of standing to bring its claims under the Contract. It should at least have been noticed that, by bringing this claim in tort, the Plaintiff <span class="font-italic">may</span> have been enforcing a bare right to litigate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In any case, the parties’ omission does not raise any particular challenges. Although the concepts maintenance and champerty have been described to be “evolving concepts” given their roots in public policy (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Smith and Leslie</span> at paras 23.07–23.13), the law as it stands is broadly settled. Since the decision in <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> Trading Corp v Credit Suisse</span> [1982] AC 679 (“<span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span>”) (also see <span class="font-italic">Lim Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hoa and another v Ong Jane Rebecca</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 775 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hoa</span>”) at [24]–[47], where the Court of Appeal referred to many salient portions of the House of Lords’ reasoning with approval), it has been accepted that an assignment of a right of action will not necessarily be struck down as savouring of maintenance or champerty. This depends on whether the assignee can show a “genuine commercial interest” in receiving the right and enforcing it for his benefit. In assessing the existence of such interest, the court looks at the “totality of the transaction” (<span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span> at 703 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Roskill).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Given the lack of a performance interest in the Employment Contract, it is difficult to see what genuine commercial interest the Plaintiff can have in a suit against the Defendant for the tort of <span class="font-italic">inducing</span> breach of such contract. It should be apparent from the name of the tort that the wrong which it seeks to remedy, is, primarily, the breach or non-performance of the contract in question. The tort is secondary to this contractual breach. As the House of Lords explained in <span class="font-italic">OBG Ltd v Allan</span> [2008] 1 AC 1, liability for inducing another’s breach of contract is a form of <span class="font-italic">secondary</span> liability ([44] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Hoffmann, [189] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Nicholls, [254] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Walker, [302] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Baroness Hale, and [319] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Brown; also see <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc v </span><span class="font-italic">Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 1 SLR 860 at [76], which similarly adopts this view).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Put simply, in the present case, even if it can be found that Mr Virgilli breached the Employment Contract, this is of no concern to and has no impact on the Plaintiff as it is not his employer. There is, as such, no genuine commercial interest which <span class="font-italic">the Plaintiff</span> can vindicate by this tortious right of action against the Defendant. I therefore find that this right of action is not assignable because it is a bare right to litigate which savours of champerty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Before I leave this point, however, it is proper for me to mention Kwek JC’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Gravitas International </span><span class="font-italic">v Virgilli</span> (see [5] above). The Plaintiff, not GHPL, was also the plaintiff in that case, and it succeeded in establishing certain claims against Mr Virgilli, based on the Employment Contract. The most significant of which were sums Kwek JC found to be due following a novation of the Employment Contract (<span class="font-italic">Gravitas International </span><span class="font-italic">v Virgilli</span> at [36]–[50]). The issue of the Plaintiff’s standing was not raised in that case. Even so, there is no inconsistency which this creates; and this is for two key reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, it is not controversial that fruits of a contract of employment, such as wages earned by an employee or conversely, sums due to an employer, are assignable (see <span class="font-italic">Beckham v Drake </span>(1849) 2 HLC 579, where the House of Lords held that a sum due to an employee pursuant to his employment contract was validly assigned to and taken over by his trustees in bankruptcy; also see other cases cited by <span class="font-italic">Smith v Leslie</span> at para 24.12). This is distinct from the present case, which concerns a right of action in tort, not contract. Historically, the law has tended to view assignments of rights of action in tort as invalid (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Defries</span><span class="font-italic"> v Milne</span> [1913] 1 Ch 98 at 109 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Farwell LJ). Although such a broad proposition cannot hold in modern law (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</span> (Michael A Jones gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 23rd Ed, 2020) at paras 5-68–5-70), my analysis at [53]–[54] above shows that the tortious action <span class="font-italic">in this case</span> certainly is not one which should push the law further away from history.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The second reason requires us to inquire as to the nature of the fruits assigned by GHPL to the Plaintiff: <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, actions in debts or damages. As a starting point, I observe that the law has developed in such a way as to treat debts as a kind of property, such that rights of action which need to be exercised in order to vindicate that property, are merely an incident of the property (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Camdex</span><span class="font-italic"> International Ltd v Bank of Zambia</span> [1998] QB 22 at 32 and 39 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Hobhouse LJ, 40 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Peter Gibson LJ, and 41 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Neill LJ; also see <span class="font-italic">Lim Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hoa</span> at [38] which affirmed this view). The validity of assignment of debts thus rides on the long been established rule that where a right of action attends or is incidental to a transfer of property, an assignment of such right will not savour of maintenance or champerty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 With this in mind, it appears to me that the claims the Plaintiff made in <span class="font-italic">Gravitas International </span><span class="font-italic">v Virgilli</span> (at least those on which it succeeded) were of the nature of debts, and not claims for contract damages. This included a salary claim and certain fees owed by Mr Virgilli on the basis of a novated Employment Contract between him and GHPL. Thus, its successful claims in that case, based on the facts found by Kwek JC do not suggest that the Plaintiff had any interest in performance of the Employment Contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the sense of being entitled to Mr Virgilli’s performance of work), so as to alter my analysis at [53]–[54] above. It was merely enforcing a right to the <span class="font-italic">fruits</span> of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Plaintiff’s contractual claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Given my finding at [46] above on the issue of the Plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>, or rather, lack thereof, I dismiss its claim. However, in the event that I have erred on the law, I will consider the Plaintiff’s claim on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Claim for unpaid fees</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Key terms of the Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I have loosely stated the purpose of the Contract at [1] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 With that in mind, the starting point is to note that the Contract did not prescribe a fixed list of services for which the Defendant was paying upfront, and would thus be entitled to receive. Instead, the structure of the Contract was such that the Defendant agreed to pay an “Engagement Fee” to GHPL, and in exchange, GHPL agreed to make available a suite of services to the Defendant, each service having its own individual, itemised cost. This is evident from cll 2.1 and 2.2 of the Contract which I set out in full below:

</div> it is not immediately obvious why this was a repudiatory breach. Indeed, as I state at [101] below, the Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence that by entering into this contract, the Defendant induced Mr Virgilli to breach his Employment Contract with GHPL. I have found in respect of (d) that no fees are owing to GHPL. So, this leaves breaches (b) and (c), but the Plaintiff has provided no particulars as to how and to what extent the Defendant failed to cooperate or perform its obligations under the Contract, much less why these failures were <span class="font-italic">repudiatory</span> breaches. I accordingly find that there is inadequate basis for me to conclude that the Defendant committed any repudiatory breaches of the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In any event, even if I assume the Defendant committed such breaches, the Plaintiff has not adduced <span class="font-italic">any</span> evidence that, had the Contract been performed to completion, the Defendant would have – as cl 2.2 prescribes as a condition – achieved its “Pre-Sale soft-cap targets”. To reiterate the burden of proof expected of plaintiffs seeking to recover lost profits, I can do no better than quote Mason CJ and Dawson J in <span class="font-italic">Commonwealth of Australia v Amann Aviation Pty</span> (1991) 104 ALR 1 (at 9–10):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The onus of proving damages sustained lies on a plaintiff and the amount of damages awarded will be commensurate with the plaintiff’s expectation, objectively determined, rather than subjectively ascertained. That is to say, a plaintiff must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that his or her expectation of a certain outcome, as a result of performance of the contract, <span class="font-italic">had a likelihood of attainment rather than being mere expectation</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In the present case, the evidence of the Plaintiff’s sole witness, Mr Tan, focused on GHPL’s performance of services under the Contract, the Defendant’s alleged breach of contract, as well as their alleged inducement of Mr Virgilli’s breach of contract. He did not give any evidence which went towards what <span class="font-italic">would have</span> happened had the Contract been performed.

</div> Lastly, but most significantly, the Defendant avers that, in light of GHPL’s poor work quality, it approached GHPL with doubts about its ability to complete the tasks necessary for the Defendant’s planned ICO. As a result, the Defendant and GHPL’s representatives (including Mr Virgilli) engaged in a conference call to discuss how to move forward with the Contract. It is the Defendant’s case that, during this discussion, it and GHPL agreed that: (a) the Contract would be terminated; (b) any work which had been substantially commenced by GHPL would be completed, alongside other works which were needed for the “orderly cessation of services”, but only to the extent of the value of the upfront fees the Defendant had already paid; and (c) all other outstanding services under the Contract, which GHPL had not commenced, was to be performed by Mr Virgilli’s company, Queen George Pte Ltd (operating under the trade name “Vox”), pursuant to a new contract.

In its defence, the Defendant avers that, in the period leading up to 8 February 2018, Mr Tan – then a director of GHPL – made numerous misrepresentations which induced it to enter the Contract. These alleged representations were that: (a) Mr Tan and GHPL were “competent and able to promote investment products and provide investment advice in the matter of ICOs”; (b) that Mr Tan and GHPL were “each knowledgeable, capable and experienced in conducting ICOs”; (c) that Mr Tan had “organised several ICOs, where he had personally raised 50 million United States Dollars for the owners in each of them”; (d) that Mr Tan “was a lawyer of good reputation and character”; and that lastly, (e) that Mr Tan had exaggerated his involvement in a number of ICOs with which he allegedly claimed to have been “intimately involved”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 On the basis of these representations, the Defendant makes two operative pleadings. First, that the false representations “gives rise to an action in misrepresentation under s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390) and/or fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation for the losses incurred by the Defendant in making the investment”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-b2ed22e7-219c-4fdb-a0f9-96abdeb0a8c8" data-toggle="modal" type="button">61</button></sup>

</div> However, no counterclaim was brought by the Defendant. There is nothing in the defence which even attempts to particularise what these losses might be. Thus, save for the factual averment that misrepresentations were made by Mr Tan, I cannot understand what the Defendant sought to achieve with this pleading, and I do not find that anything substantive can be made of it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The second operative pleading which the Defendant makes in respect of the misrepresentations Mr Tan allegedly made is that it has, on this basis, “a right to rescind or terminate the [Contract]”.

</div>
</div> On the case of both parties, the Contract has long been terminated, and as such, seeking “termination” is meaningless. As to rescission, I cannot understand what the Defendant seeks when it says the Contract should be rescinded. If it prays for the remedy of rescission <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span>, a proper counterclaim should have been brought as I have stated in the paragraph above. So, once again, nothing can be made of this pleading.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Plaintiff’s tortious claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 For the reasons at [53]–[54] above, I found that the right of action against the Defendant for inducing Mr Virgilli’s breach of the Employment Contract is, a bare right to litigate which could not have been validly assigned by GHPL to the Plaintiff. Indeed, as I have stated, it savours of champerty. I therefore dismiss the Plaintiff’s tortious claim on this basis. That said, as with the Plaintiff’s claim in contract, I will alternatively consider this claim on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The elements for the tort of inducement of breach of contract are well-known (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span><span class="font-italic"> SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai </span>[2015] 1 SLR 163 at [285]): (a) the defendant must know of the existence of the contract and intend to procure its breach; (b) there must have been procurement of the breach whether by persuasion, inducement or otherwise; (c) there must in fact have been a breach; and (d) the plaintiff must have suffered damage as a result <span class="font-italic">of the breach of contract</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The Plaintiff’s claim fails roundly on the last element. Its pleaded case is that the Defendant caused Mr Virgilli to “cease and/or refuse” to work for GHPL by entering into a new consultancy agreement with Mr Virgilli’s company, Vox. In <span class="font-italic">Gravitas International </span><span class="font-italic">v Virgilli</span>, the Plaintiff averred that Mr Virgilli failed to give the requisite <span class="font-italic">one-months’</span> notice pursuant to the Employment Contract. On that basis, one claim in that suit was for S$11,000 representing a month of Mr Virgilli’s salary, in lieu of his notice (see <span class="font-italic">Gravitas International</span><span class="font-italic"> v Virgilli</span> at [58]). Kwek JC allowed the Plaintiff’s claim, finding that Mr Virgilli had failed to give notice of termination (at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Having successfully claimed one months’ salary in lieu of notice, there seems to me to be no other loss which GHPL – and by extension, the Plaintiff as its assignee – can recover. It is trite that employees may terminate their contracts of employment, without any cause, so long as requisite notice is served. Given the “minimum legal obligation rule” (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Wong Sung Boon v Fuji Xerox Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2021] SGHC 24 at [120]–[121], citing <span class="font-italic">Alexander Proudfoot Productivity Services Co </span><span class="font-italic">S’pore Pte Ltd v Sim Hua Ngee Alvin and another appeal</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 933 at [13]), where an employee fails to give sufficient notice in breach of contract, the quantum of the employer’s claim is limited to the salary representing the period of notice which should have been given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The proposition that employees can validly terminate their contracts of employment with sufficient notice is so established, in fact, that there is no need for me to deal with the other factual elements in the alternative. Though, I will make one brief remark in vindication of the Defendant. The Plaintiff adduced no evidence which showed that the Defendant persuaded, induced, or otherwise procured Mr Virgilli’s breach of contract. All the Plaintiff has shown is that the Defendant entered into the new consultancy agreement with Mr Virgilli. There was no evidence showing that Mr Virgilli was prohibited from taking on external work – in fact, the Plaintiff did not even adduce the Employment Contract as evidence before me – nor was there anything showing that the Defendant knew that, by entering into the new consultancy agreement, that Mr Virgilli would even terminate the Employment Contract without notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Thus, even on the facts, the Plaintiff’s tortious claim fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss both the Plaintiff’s contractual and tortious claims primarily on the grounds that it lacks <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>. The proper plaintiff is GHPL. In any event, I have nevertheless assessed the evidence in support of the Plaintiff’s claims, and I find alternatively that, even if I had erred on the law, the facts do not bear them out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I will hear parties on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">K V Sudeep Kumar and Airell Ang (Magna Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Han Wah Teng and Winston Chui (CTLC Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
