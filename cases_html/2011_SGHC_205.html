<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this judgment, the workings of the
                    Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits)
                    Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”) will be considered and
                    applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In essence, this case concerned an application
                    by the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) for the confiscation of the
                    benefits derived by Ng Teck Lee (“NTL”) from his criminal conduct
                    and the realisation of property to satisfy the confiscation order. There were
                    also applications by three parties, namely, Centillion Environment &amp;
                    Recycling Ltd (“Centillion”), Thor Beng Huat (“TBH”)
                    and Ung Yoke Hooi (“UYH”) who asserted their interests in some of
                    the properties which the PP considers to be realisable under the
                CDSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">NTL’s alleged offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       NTL was the Chief Executive Officer cum
                    President of Citiraya Industries Ltd (“Citiraya”) (as the company
                    was named before changing its name to Centillion). Citiraya was engaged in the
                    business of recycling and recovering precious metals from electronic scrap.
                    Citiraya entered into agreements with a number of companies which produced
                    computer chips (“the chip manufacturers”) whereby Citiraya was to
                    crush substandard items made by the chip manufacturers and recover precious
                    metals from that scrap.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       NTL’s criminal conduct was uncovered by
                    the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”). Chief Special
                    Investigator Fong Wai Kit (“Fong”) of the CPIB filed an affidavit
                    in these proceedings on 10 June 2008 in which he stated that investigations
                    against NTL were commenced following the receipt of a complaint in December
                    2004. The investigations related to offences including criminal breach of trust
                    as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and other
                    offences, all of which came within the definition of a “serious
                    offence” under the Second Schedule to the CDSA. The relevant paragraphs
                    of Fong’s affidavit stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    As the Chief Executive Officer cum President of
                            [Citiraya], [NTL] was entrusted with electronic scrap sent to [Citiraya]
                            by its clients for destruction. With the assistance of his brother, Ng
                            Teck Boon, [NTL] had misappropriated a portion of the electronic scrap
                            sent to [Citiraya] for destruction by [the chip manufacturers] in the
                            years 2003 and 2004. Instead of crushing all the electronic scrap in
                            accordance with the terms of the agreements [Citiraya] had with [the
                            chip manufacturers], a portion was removed from the premises of
                            [Citiraya] and subsequently repacked and sold to buyers in Hong Kong and
                            Taiwan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    Ng Teck Boon, the General Manager of [Citiraya],
                            helped to arrange for the misappropriated electronic scrap (which
                            included computer chips) to be delivered to Thor Beng Kiong at a
                            warehouse at 67 Ubi Crescent #04-05 and later to a warehouse at 3A Joo
                            Koon Circle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    Thor Beng Kiong, [NTL’s] brother-in-law,
                            would sort and repack the misappropriated computer chips pursuant to
                            [NTL’s] instructions. Gan Chin Chin, [NTL’s] personal
                            financial adviser and Chief Financial Officer of [Citiraya], would then
                            arrange for the misappropriated computer chips to be delivered to buyers
                            in Hong Kong and China based on [NTL’s]
                        instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Gan Chin Chin confirmed that a total of 62
                            shipments of misappropriated computer chips were made in 2003 and 2004.
                            Most of the payments for the 62 shipments were made to two bank accounts
                            in Hong Kong held by Pan Asset International Limited (“Pan
                            Asset”): Credit Suisse Hong Kong Branch (“Credit
                            Suisse”) account [xxx] and UBS AG Hong Kong Branch
                            (“UBS”) account [xxx]. Pan Asset is a company incorporated
                            in the British Virgin Islands in the name of Gan Chin Chin but owned and
                            controlled by [NTL]. A total sum of <b>US$51,196,938.52</b> was received by [NTL] as payment for
                            the 62 shipments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Gan Chin Chin (“Gan”), former
                    Chief Financial Officer of Citiraya and personal financial advisor to NTL,
                    deposed an affidavit in which she confirmed her role in Citiraya and in
                    NTL’s criminal activities. She went on to disclose that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Although companies
                            such as Neat World Trading and Compunet Trading were named as the
                            sellers of the computer chips, [NTL] instructed that payments for the
                            computer chips were to be made to two particular bank accounts of a
                            company known as Pan Asset International Limited (“Pan
                            Asset”). Pan Asset is a company incorporated in the British
                            Virgin Islands under my name pursuant to [NTL’s] instructions. The
                            company belongs to [NTL].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    The
                            two bank accounts of Pan Asset that payments for the computer chips were
                            made to are:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) account no. [xxx];

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    I was managing all the transactions in relation to
                            these two bank accounts held by Pan Asset. All credits and debits made
                            to these accounts were based on [NTL’s] instructions. Most of the
                            proceeds of sale of the 62 shipments of computer chips ... were paid
                            into these two bank accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    A total sum of <b>US$51,196,938.52</b> was received as payment for the 62
                            shipments of computer chips. Out the [<em>sic</em>]
                            total payments received, US$ 24,897,394.43 was credited into Pan

                            USD 20,349,608.09 was credited into Pan Asset’s UBS Hong Kong
                            account (Account No: [xxx]). The remaining US$ 5,949,936.00 was credited

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       NTL was not charged or prosecuted for any
                    offence because he had left Singapore on 19 January 2005 and had not
                    returned since.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Following his departure, efforts were made to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Centillion and TBH asserted their interests in
                    particular properties that the PP sought to realise on 11 July 2008 and
                    21 October 2008 respectively. When the PP’s application came on for
                    hearing, I informed the parties that I proposed to deal with the PP’s
                    application for a confiscation order first, on the understanding that the making
                    of the order would not prejudice the right of any third party to assert their
                    interest in any properties. There were no objections to the proposal, and the
                    confiscation order was made on 4 May 2009. UYH subsequently asserted his
                    interest on 22 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It was necessary in these proceedings to have
                    a clear understanding of the term “benefits derived … from

                            income, and the holding of which cannot be explained to the satisfaction

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On a reading of s 8(1)(<em>a</em>), the benefits derived by a person from criminal conduct are
                    determined by a process where:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     the person’s property or
                        interest in the property is established;</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     it is established that the property or interest in the property is
                        disproportionate to the person’s known sources of income, and the
                        disproportionality is not explained to the satisfaction of the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the application for a confiscation order in this
                    case the PP did not refer to s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) or the
                    requirements therein, but instead presented direct evidence that NTL had derived
                    benefits amounting to US$51,196,938.5 from the sale of the computer chips
                    misappropriated from Centillion (“the misappropriated
                    chips”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The proper construction of
                        s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) was critical to the PP’s
                    application. Section 8(1)(<em>a</em>) may be construed as
                    the <em>exhaustive</em> definition of benefits derived from
                    criminal conduct, or it may be construed as <em>one</em>
                    definition of the benefits. This issue was not raised during the
                hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     There is a good reason for the definition in
                        s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) to be regarded as
                    non-exhaustive. If a person is known:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     to have engaged in criminal conduct;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     to have
                        obtained $X from the criminal conduct,</p>
<p class="Judg-1">then the court
                    should find that $X is the benefit derived from the criminal conduct without
                    having to refer to s 8(1)(<em>a</em>). It is only in a
                    situation where a person is known to have engaged in criminal conduct but the
                    amount of benefit that he had derived from the criminal conduct is not known
                    that s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) is needed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The process in s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) predates the CDSA. It can be traced back to
                        s 5(1)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the Corruption
                    (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (No 16 of 1989) (“CCBA”), which

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [L]et us take the case of an offender who has been corrupt prior
                        to that particular offence for which there was discovery and for which he
                        was charged. He may have assets which are clearly disproportionate to his
                        known sources of income and for which he can give no satisfactory
                        explanation. <em>Such assets, under existing law, cannot be

                        specially within his own knowledge and it would be difficult, if not,
                        impossible to obtain evidence concerning them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bill, therefore, provides new powers for tracing and freezing the
                        benefits of corruption and for confiscating those benefits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under clause 4, Sir, where a person has been convicted of a corruption
                        offence and the Public Prosecutor makes an application to the court, the

                        benefits derived by him from corruption. The safeguard is that the court
                        must be satisfied that such benefits have been so derived. A person is
                            <em>deemed to have derived benefits</em> from
                        corruption if he holds or has held assets disproportionate to his known

                        satisfaction of the court. The onus of explaining assets which are
                        disproportionate to the defendant's known sources of income is placed on
                        him. This is fair since it will only apply after he has been convicted of a
                        corruption offence and that he is in the best position to explain how he

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In a further speech, Professor Jayakumar spoke
                    on clause 4 and clause 5 of the Bill, which were to become s 4 and s 5
                    of the CCBA respectively (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 4, subsection (4) <em>deems</em> a person to

                        satisfactorily accounted for. Under clause 5, these disproportionate and
                        unexplained assets constitute the benefits of corruption. But as there may
                        be situations where the personal representatives or next-of-kin are unable
                        to rebut the <em>presumptions</em> in clause[s] 4,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It can be seen from this legislative material
                    that s 4(4) and s 5(1)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the CCBA
                    were enacted to facilitate the confiscation of the property of a person who has
                    engaged in corrupt practices by creating <em>presumptions</em> which could be applied where there is no proof that
                    the person had derived direct benefit from acts of corruption. The CCBA has been
                    repealed and the confiscation of benefits derived from corruption is now dealt
                    with under the CDSA. Section 5(1)(<em>a</em>)(i) of
                    the CCBA is carried over in s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    CDSA, and s 4(4) of the CCBA is carried over in s 5(6) of the CDSA
                    which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    … [F]or the purposes of this Act, a person

                            accruing from such property or interest) disproportionate to his known
                            sources of income, the holding of which cannot be explained to the
                            satisfaction of the court, shall, until the contrary is proved, be
                            presumed to have derived benefits from criminal conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     When s 8(1)(<em>a</em>) of the CDSA is read against its legislative history and in
                    conjunction with s 5(6) of the CDSA, it is clear that it is a presumptive
                    provision and not an exhaustive definition of the benefits derived from criminal
                    conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applications relating to realisation of property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After the making of the confiscation order
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above, I turned my
                    attention to the applications relating to the realisation of property under
                    s 19 of the CDSA. There were a multitude of applications from Centillion,
                    UYH and TBH. The applications were, <em>inter
                    alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Centillion’s application for a
                        declaration that it has an interest in the properties the PP was seeking to
                        realise;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     UYH’s application for a declaration that he is the beneficial owner
                        of the money in his bank accounts which the PP was seeking to realise;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     TBH’s
                        application for a declaration that he is the beneficial owner of TCH’s
                        60% interest in the property known as 95A Paya Lebar Crescent, which the PP
                        was seeking to realise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     While the claimants’ applications were
                    for different forms of relief, the purpose behind them was common: they opposed
                    the PP’s application for a realisation order over some properties on the
                    ground that they had interests in some of the properties. In view of that, I
                    proposed (and the parties agreed) that the third party claimants’
                    applications, despite being taken out under a variety of different procedures,
                    were to be taken as applications under s 13 of the CDSA which deals with
                    the protection of rights of third parties under that Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The effect of s 13 had to be considered.
                    The relevant sections have been set out at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above. Section 13(1) requires a third party who
                    asserts an interest in a property affected by a confiscation application to
                    apply for an order under s 13(2) (ss 13(3) and (4) also allow third
                    party applications to be made after a confiscation order has been made.)
                    Section 13(2) sets out two conditions in sub-sections (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) that the applicant must
                    satisfy before he can succeed. The condition in s 13(2)(<em>a</em>) relates to the applicant rather than the property. The
                    condition in s 13(2)(<em>b</em>) relates to the
                    acquisition of the property, and it is not clear whether it relates to any
                    property acquired by the applicant or only to property acquired by the applicant
                    from the defendant. Section 13(2)(<em>b</em>)(i)
                    suggests the latter interpretation because the sufficiency or existence of
                    consideration is not relevant unless the property was acquired from the
                    defendant. Although this is not expressly stated in s 13, a declaration in
                    an applicant’s favour under s 13(2) would mean that the property in
                    question is not realisable property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of the PP’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The PP’s application extended over 28
                    classes of property set out in para 5 of the PP’s amended Originating
                    Summons No 785 of 2008 (“OS 785/2008”). I have listed these
                    properties in the PP’s List of Realisable Properties (Appendix A).
                    The PP regarded the listed properties as realisable property under the CDSA.
                    Realisable property is defined in s 2 as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    any property held by
                            the defendant; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    any property held by
                            a person to whom the defendant has, directly or indirectly, made a gift
                            caught by this Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Definition (<em>b</em>) covers not only gifts
                    caught by the Act, but <em>any</em> property held by the
                    recipient of such gifts. In this light it should be noted that s 21(3)
                    provides that the amount to be realised in the case of such a recipient shall
                    not exceed the value of the gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     A “gift caught by the Act” is in
                    turn defined in s 12(8):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8)    A gift (including a
                            gift made before 13th September 1999) is caught by this Act if

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    it was made by
                                the defendant at any time since the beginning of the period of 6
                                years ending when the proceedings for a serious offence were
                                instituted against him or, where no such proceedings have been
                                instituted, when an application under section 5 for a confiscation
                                order is made against him; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    it was made by
                                the defendant at any time and was a gift of property which is or is
                                part of the benefits derived by the defendant from criminal
                                conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Under this definition, s 12(8)(<em>a</em>) covers gifts made by NTL within the period of six
                    years prior to 10 June 2008 (the date the application for the
                    confiscation order was made) and s 12(8)(<em>b</em>)
                    covers gifts made at any time out of the benefits derived from NTL’s
                    criminal conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Effectively, a “realisable
                    property” can be any property held by NTL, whether or not it is derived
                    from criminal conduct, and any property held by a person to whom NTL had made a
                    “gift caught by the Act”, even if the specific property is not
                    itself a “gift caught by the Act”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of UYH’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     UYH claimed an interest in the money in five
                    bank accounts in his name. The PP asserted that these were realisable properties
                    at para 5.18 of OS 785/2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of Centillion’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Intervention by a “white knight”
                    enabled Centillion to survive NTL’s misappropriations. The company entered
                    into a scheme of arrangement with its creditors. Centillion sued NTL and
                    obtained a default judgment against him on 3 November 2008 for the sum of
                    $51,196,938.52 (in Singapore dollars; contrast the currency stated in
                    Fong’s and Gan’s affidavits at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> and <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Through the administrator of the scheme of
                    arrangement, Centillion put forward its application on two grounds. It asserted
                    as judgment creditor an interest in a majority of the properties the PP asserted
                    to be realisable, and, alternatively, it claimed an interest in a smaller
                    category of traceable properties on the basis that NTL held these properties as
                    constructive trustee for Centillion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of TBH’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     TBH claimed a beneficial interest in
                    TCH’s 60% share of the property known as 95A Paya Lebar Crescent. The PP
                    asserted that this share was a realisable property at para 5.9 of
                    OS 785/2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings relating to the parties’ applications</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings on the PP’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The PP had to show that the properties in his
                    application were realisable property as defined in s 2 <em>ie</em> that they were either property held by NTL or property held
                    by a person to whom NTL had made a “gift caught by the Act” as
                    defined in s 12(8) (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above).
                    Some of the properties at para 5 of OS 785/2008 (and listed in Appendix A)
                    were not realisable property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I have listed the true realisable assets in
                    the List of Realisable Properties (Appendix B). These properties were realisable
                    properties because they were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     properties in the name of
                        NTL;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     properties
                        in the names of persons (namely, Gan Chin Chin, Kwok Seng Hua and Goh Lik
                        In) who admitted that they held the properties on trust for NTL;
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     money in the
                        client account of M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP in the name of NTL. The
                        account number has been stated as [xxx] in para 10 of Fong’s affidavit
                        filed on 11 February 2009 and [xxx] in para 5.28 of OS 785/2008.
                        The correct account number should be verified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The list in Appendix B is shorter than
                    the list in Appendix A because of the exclusion from Appendix A of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     the properties at paras 5.6, 5.7,
                        5.8 and 5.9 of OS 785/2008 and TCH’s half share of the properties at
                        paras 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 of OS 785/2008 (TCH’s
                    properties);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        properties at paras 5.26 and 5.27 of OS 785/2008 which the PP had included
                        on the basis of the hearsay evidence said to be from Wee Kok Keng
                        (“Wee”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     the properties at para 5.18 of OS 785/2008 (UYH’s
                        properties); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     the traceable properties in respect of Centillion’s
                        application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The properties at paras 5.6, 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9
                    of OS 785/2008 were properties in the name of TCH. The properties at paras 5.3,
                    5.4 and 5.5 of OS 785/2008 were properties in the joint names of NTL and
                    TCH, of which TCH held a half share. The PP had sought to include TCH’s
                    properties as realisable properties on the basis that TCH had no employment
                    record and was a homemaker, and her properties must therefore have been derived
                    from NTL. The flaw in this argument was that those properties had to be
                    realisable properties as defined in s 2 of the CDSA (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above). As they were not held by NTL they did
                    not fall under definition (<em>a</em>). For any property
                    held by TCH to be a realisable property under definition (<em>b</em>), it had to be established that NTL had made a gift caught by
                    the Act to her. By the definition in s 12(8), that would include gifts made
                    by NTL to TCH within six years prior to the date of application for the
                    confiscation order (10 June 2008) and any gifts made by NTL to TCH out of
                    the benefits of his criminal conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The only evidence relating to a gift made from
                    NTL to TCH was the following statement in Fong’s affidavit at para
                    29:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29.    From the proceeds of sale of the misappropriated
                            electronic scrap, [NTL] <b><em>gave</em></b> no less than
                                <em>US$1,249[,]414.10 and $3,001,465.48</em> to
                            his wife, [TCH]. He had instructed [Gan] to transfer the following sums
                            of money from Pan Asset’s Credit Suisse account [xxx] to
                            [TCH]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Fong then set out several bank transfers from Pan Asset International
                    Limited (“Pan Asset”)’s Credit Suisse account [xxx] to
                    TCH’s bank accounts. These transfers totalled US$1,249,414.10 and
                    $3,001,465.48. Fong did not disclose the basis for him to assert (a) that the
                    US$1,249,414.10 and $3,001,465.48 came from the proceeds of sale of the
                    misappropriated chips and (b) that the money was a gift from NTL to
                TCH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Gan, who received NTL’s instructions and
                    made the transfers mentioned above, only stated (at para 36 of her affidavit)
                    that NTL had instructed her to transfer sums totalling US$1,249,414.10 and
                    $3,001,465.48 from Pan Asset’s Credit Suisse account [xxx] to TCH. She did
                    not state that the money was derived from the proceeds of sale of the
                    misappropriated chips or that the transfers were gifts from NTL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There was therefore no proper evidence that
                    the money transferred to TCH from Pan Asset’s accounts came from the sale
                    of the misappropriated chips or that it was gifted to TCH by NTL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Even if it was assumed that TCH’s wealth
                    was derived from NTL, there was no evidence that those properties were direct
                    gifts from NTL or that TCH had acquired the properties in question with gifts
                    that she had received from NTL within the six years prior to
                    10 June 2008. TCH may have acquired those properties with money gifted
                    to her by NTL before the six-year period. There was also no evidence that TCH
                    used money that was gifted to her by NTL out of the benefits derived from his
                    criminal conduct to acquire those properties. NTL was engaged in legitimate
                    business and it could not be assumed that any gift he made to TCH was derived
                    from his criminal activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The properties listed at paras 5.26 and 5.27
                    of OS 785/2008 were shares and money held by a company, Ventures Trust Pte Ltd
                    (“Ventures Trust”), which was alleged in Fong’s affidavit to
                    have been set up by Wee. Fong also alleged that Wee confirmed that the shares
                    and money belonged beneficially to NTL. However, the PP did not adduce any
                    direct evidence from Wee. The reason put forward was that Wee lives and works
                        overseas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Wee’s
                    “evidence” regarding these properties was hearsay evidence which
                    did not come within the exceptions to the hearsay rule in s 32(<em>c</em>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), and
                    was inadmissible. Consequently, the shares and money held by Ventures Trust
                    could not be regarded as properties of NTL and were not realisable
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings on UYH’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     UYH asserted that the monies in his bank
                    accounts were the balance of $2m received as part payment due under an oral
                    agreement for NTL to buy from him, Ung Yoke Khim (“UYK”) and Soon
                    Ah Lan (“SAL”) four million shares in a company, Citiraya
                    Teknologi Sdn Bhd (“CTSB”), which major shareholder was
                    Centillion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The PP disputed the existence of the
                    agreement. Questions were raised over the fact that the agreement was not
                    evidenced in writing and that no shares were transferred to NTL (UYH’s
                    evidence was that it was agreed that the shares were to be transferred only upon
                    full payment). UYH had produced affidavits from UYK and SAL which confirmed that
                    there was to be a sale of the shares. These affidavits exhibited letters from
                    UYK and SAL appointing UYH to represent them in the negotiations. UYK gave oral
                    evidence at the hearing and he was not questioned on the letter of authority he
                    issued to UYH. SAL’s attendance in court was dispensed with when it was
                    disclosed that she was hospitalised in Malaysia and was
                uncontactable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I found on a balance of probabilities that
                    there was an agreement for the sale of the shares as described by UYH. There was
                    no dispute that UYH, UYK and SAL owned four million shares in CTSB which they
                    were prepared to sell to NTL. On the other hand, the PP did not put up any
                    plausible reason for UYH to be holding the money on trust for NTL, or for NTL to
                    have made gifts of the money to UYH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I found that UYH had established his interest
                    in the money in his bank accounts. There was no allegation that
                        s 13(2)(<em>a</em>) or s 13(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the CDSA applied to him. As for the issue of
                    consideration under s 13(2)(<em>b</em>)(i), there was
                    no allegation that the purchase price of $1 a share (as stated by UYH) was
                    insufficient consideration. However, I did not declare that the money belonged
                    to UYH beneficially because the money may be refundable as the sale of the
                    shares was aborted because CTSB was wound up subsequently. That question should
                    be determined in separate proceedings between NTL, UYH, UYK and SAL. I limited
                    myself to declaring that the money in the accounts as stated at para 5.18
                    of OS 785/2008 was not realisable property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It should be stated that the PP had included
                    the monies in two of the five bank accounts of UYH (corresponding to paras
                    5.18(i)–(ii) of OS 785/2008) in an affidavit listing properties that
                    were traceable to the proceeds of sale of the misappropriated chips (see
                        <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> below), and this list was accepted
                    by Centillion. However, UYH had not accepted the list, and he was not bound by
                    any admissions contained in it. As the inclusion of the two accounts in the list
                    was not supported by any evidence, there was no proof, as far as UYH was
                    concerned, that the money in the two accounts was traceable to the proceeds of
                    sale of the misappropriated chips.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings on Centillion’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Centillion based its application on two
                    grounds, firstly as a judgment creditor, and secondly as a beneficiary under
                    constructive trusts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On the first ground, Centillion claimed that
                    as judgment creditor, it had an interest in the property of NTL. It relied on
                    the definition of an “interest” in relation to property in
                    s 2 of the CDSA, which states that such an “interest”
                    “includes any right”. It was argued that “any right”
                    included a right to take out enforcement proceedings over property. As support
                    for this contention, Centillion’s counsel relied on an Australian act, the
                    Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Act 87 of 1987) (Cth) (“POCA”) which
                    provides for the confiscation of benefits of corruption. The specific provision
                    relied on was s 4 of the POCA, which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“interest”, in relation to property,
                        means:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    a legal or equitable estate or interest in the
                                property; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    a right, power or privilege in connection with
                                the property,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">whether present or future and whether rested or contingent …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Counsel contended that the right to take out
                    enforcement proceedings would come within the definition in s 4 of the POCA
                    and that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    … It is appropriate for the Court to have
                            regard to the meaning of “interest” under the [POCA]
                            because ... section 13 of the CDSA was adapted from section 31
                            of the [POCA].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Counsel for Centillion did not go so far as to state whether the
                    POCA definition of “interest” is established to include the right
                    to take out execution proceedings or why the POCA definition would apply to
                    proceedings under the CDSA, which has its own definition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     When s 2 of the CDSA defines
                    “interest” to include “any right”, it uses the words
                    “‘interest’ … in relation to property”. The
                    “right” referred to must be a right relating to the property in
                    dispute. In a situation where an application for a realisation order is made in
                    respect of specified properties, “any right” asserted by a third
                    party under s 13 must relate to those specified properties. A general right
                    to take out enforcement proceedings pursuant to a judgment is not a right in any
                    specific property. It can be argued that when enforcement proceedings are
                    commenced with regard to specified properties, the judgment creditor has a
                    potential interest in the properties, and when the right of enforcement is
                    obtained, the judgment creditor would have an actual interest in those
                    properties. However, on these facts Centillion had not taken out any enforcement
                    proceedings in relation to the properties in question, and no explanation was
                    given for that. Could it be that Centillion was not able to take out enforcement
                    proceedings against those properties? As the onus was on Centillion to show that
                    it had an interest in the properties in question, Centillion had not discharged
                    the onus simply by referring to the judgment in its favour against
                NTL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Centillion also made a claim on some of the
                    properties as beneficiary of a constructive trust. There is some background to
                    this claim that should be mentioned. Centillion had applied for discovery
                    against the PP. Centillion explained that it needed to discover evidence on the
                    proceeds of sale of the misappropriated chips, in particular, whether the
                    proceeds had been used to purchase properties, and if so, what the properties
                    purchased were. The PP was prepared to give discovery of the documents seized
                    from Centillion, but was not prepared to give discovery of the documents of
                    third parties without their consent. The impasse was resolved when the PP
                    offered to file an affidavit to disclose the properties which could be traced to
                    the proceeds of sale of the misappropriated chips. The PP filed an affidavit on
                    12 July 2010 deposed by Principal Special Investigator Tok Thiam Soon
                    Frederick (“Tok”) of the CPIB in which he stated that the
                    properties described in paras 5.10(ii), 5.11, 5.13, 5.14, 5.15, 5.17,
                    5.18(i), 5.18(ii), 5.19(i)(a), 5.20, 5.21, 5.22, 5.23, 5.24, 5.25, 5.26 and 5.27
                    of OS 785/2008 were established in investigations to be “traceable
                    to the proceeds of sale of the chips misappropriated by [NTL]”. On
                    receipt of the affidavit, Centillion did not proceed with its application for
                    discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I should highlight the fact that while
                    Tok’s statements could be regarded as containing admissions that bind the
                    PP (and were accepted by Centillion), they did not bind the other parties. This
                    is why Tok’s affidavit could not bind UYH in respect of the properties
                    listed at paras 5.18(i)–(ii) of OS 785/2008 (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above). Similarly, Tok’s affidavit could not bind
                    Ventures Trust concerning the properties listed at paras 5.26 and 5.27 which
                    were held by Ventures Trust as those were not proven to be realisable (see
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Counsel for Centillion then argued that as NTL
                    had misappropriated the chips from Centillion, NTL held the proceeds of the sale
                    of the chips and the property acquired with those proceeds as a constructive
                    trustee for the benefit of Centillion. This was an argument based on tracing
                    from property misappropriated from Centillion. Centillion also had an
                    alternative constructive trust argument, namely that NTL had made illegal
                    profits by misappropriating the chips. Centillion therefore asserted that
                    NTL’s illegal profits (and the properties traceable from those profits)
                    were subject to a constructive trust in favour of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Two landmark decisions, <em>Attorney-General of Hong Kong v Charles Warwick Reid and others</em>
                    [1994] 1 AC 324 (“<em>AG v Reid</em>”) and
                        <em>Thahir Kartika Ratna v PT Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas
                        Bumi Negara (Pertamina)</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 312
                        (“<em>Pertamina</em>”), were cited as
                    authority for Centillion’s contention. Both cases dealt with the question
                    of whether a principal was entitled to assert a beneficial interest in a bribe
                    received by an agent or fiduciary, and in both cases, it was held that the
                    principal was entitled to assert a constructive trust over the bribe (and
                    property traceable from the bribe).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In particular, Centillion’s counsel set
                    out in its submissions Lord Templeman’s finding in <em>AG v
                        Reid</em> at pp 331B–332A as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a bribe is offered and accepted in money or in kind, the money or
                        property constituting the bribe belongs in law to the recipient. Money paid
                        to the false fiduciary belongs to him. The legal estate in freehold property
                        conveyed to the false fiduciary by way of bribe vests in him. Equity,
                        however, which acts in personam, insists that it is unconscionable for a
                        fiduciary to obtain and retain a benefit in breach of duty. The provider of
                        a bribe cannot recover it because he committed a criminal offence when he
                        paid the bribe. The false fiduciary who received the bribe in breach of duty
                        must pay and account for the bribe to the person to whom that duty was owed.
                        In the present case, as soon as the first respondent received a bribe in
                        breach of the duties he owed to the Government of Hong Kong, he became a
                        debtor in equity to the Crown for the amount of that bribe. So much is
                        admitted. But if the bribe consists of property which increases in value or
                        if a cash bribe is invested advantageously, the false fiduciary will receive
                        a benefit from his breach of duty unless he is accountable not only for the
                        original amount or value of the bribe but also for the increased value of
                        the property representing the bribe. As soon as the bribe was received it
                        should have been paid or transferred instanter to the person who suffered
                        from the breach of duty. Equity considers as done that which ought to have
                        been done. As soon as the bribe was received, whether in cash or in kind,
                        the false fiduciary held the bribe on a constructive trust for the person
                        injured. Two objections have been raised to this analysis. First it is said
                        that if the fiduciary is in equity a debtor to the person injured, he cannot
                        also be a trustee of the bribe. But there is no reason why equity should not
                        provide two remedies, so long as they do not result in double recovery. If
                        the property representing the bribe exceeds the original bribe in value, the
                        fiduciary cannot retain the benefit of the increase in value which he
                        obtained solely as a result of his breach of duty. Secondly, it is said that
                        if the false fiduciary holds property representing the bribe in trust for
                        the person injured, and if the false fiduciary is or becomes insolvent, the
                        unsecured creditors of the false fiduciary will be deprived of their right
                        to share in the proceeds of that property. But the unsecured creditors
                        cannot be in a better position than their debtor. The authorities show that
                        property acquired by a trustee innocently but in breach of trust and the
                        property from time to time representing the same belong in equity to the
                        cestui que trust and not to the trustee personally whether he is solvent or
                        insolvent. Property acquired by a trustee as a result of a criminal breach
                        of trust and the property from time to time representing the same must also
                        belong in equity to his cestui que trust and not to the trustee whether he
                        is solvent or insolvent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a bribe is accepted by a fiduciary in breach of his duty then he
                        holds that bribe in trust for the person to whom the duty was owed. If the
                        property representing the bribe decreases in value the fiduciary must pay
                        the difference between that value and the initial amount of the bribe
                        because he should not have accepted the bribe or incurred the risk of loss.
                        If the property increases in value, the fiduciary is not entitled to any
                        surplus in excess of the initial value of the bribe because he is not
                        allowed by any means to make a profit out of a breach of duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage was applied in <em>Pertamina</em> at
                        [56].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     
          <em>AG v Reid</em> and
                        <em>Pertamina</em> related to a form of trust which
                    does not exist until the bribes are received by a fiduciary in breach of his
                    duties, as contrasted to cases where property is entrusted onto the wrongdoer
                    from the outset, prior to the wrongdoing. The decision of the English Court of
                    Appeal in <em>J J Harrison (Properties) Ltd v
                        Harrison</em> [2002] 1 BCLC 162 (“<em>Harrison</em>”) dealt with a trust of the second form. In that
                    case, a director of a company disposed of the company’s property in breach
                    of his fiduciary duties. Chadwick LJ held at [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[27]  It follows, also, from the principle that
                            directors who dispose of the company’s property in breach of their
                            fiduciary duties are treated as having committed a breach of trust that,
                            a director who is, himself, the recipient of the property holds it upon
                            a trust for the company. He, also, is described as a constructive
                            trustee. But, as Millett LJ explained in <em>Paragon
                                Finance plc v D B Thakerar &amp; Co</em> [1999] 1 All ER 400
                            at 408–409, his trusteeship is different in character from that of
                            the stranger. He falls into the category of persons who, in the words of
                            Millett LJ ([1999] 1 All ER 400 at 408) ... ‘though not strictly
                            trustees, were in an analogous position and who abused the trust and
                            confidence reposed in them to obtain their principal’s property
                            for themselves.’</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage applies squarely to NTL. The trust of the type in
                        <em>Harrison</em> conforms to the conventional view on
                    trust, while the bribe-related trusts in <em>AG v Reid</em>
                    and <em>Pertamina</em> reflect a more recent development in
                    the law of trust. Both forms of trust are recognised in Singapore. Under both
                    types of constructive trust, I found on the basis of Tok’s evidence (see
                        <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above) that NTL held the properties in the List of
                    Constructive Trust Properties (Appendix C) on trust for
                Centillion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The PP raised multiple arguments against a
                    constructive trust. The first argument was that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    ... [NTL] was [Centillion’s] CEO and its
                            directing mind. His actions were the actions of the company, and the
                            company acted through him. Thus when he sold used or defective computer
                            chips slated for crushing for enormous profits, it can be said that the
                            company did this. …<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is a curious argument. Firstly, there was no evidence that
                    NTL was the directing mind of Centillion. Secondly, it is ridiculous to say that
                    when NTL misappropriated the chips from Centillion, sold them and kept the
                    proceeds for himself, it can be said that the company did that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The second argument was that Centillion was
                    not entitled to claim a constructive trust over the proceeds of the sale of the
                    misappropriated chips because Centillion could not have obtained those proceeds
                    in the usual course of its business, and therefore Centillion was attempting to
                    obtain “unjust, if not illegal, enrichment for
                        itself.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                    The argument is misconceived. Under the analysis in <em>AG v
                        Reid</em>, the constructive trust arises out of NTL’s breach of
                    his fiduciary duties to the company, and the constructive trust applies to all
                    benefits NTL derived from the breach of these duties. There is no basis to
                    confine the constructive trust to the benefits that Centillion would have
                    derived in the course of its business. The argument confuses Centillion’s
                    entitlement to restitution in respect of its direct loss of the misappropriated
                    chips with Centillion’s entitlement as the beneficiary of a constructive
                    trust to the benefits NTL derived from his breach of fiduciary duties. In this
                    case it is the latter that is under consideration, not the former. Under the
                        <em>Harrison</em> type of constructive trust it is even
                    clearer that the properties traceable from the proceeds of sale of the
                    misappropriated chips represent, on a totally orthodox tracing analysis, the
                    value of Centillion’s misappropriated chips. There is no reason this value
                    should not be claimed by Centillion as constructive trustee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is not unjust for there to be a
                    constructive trust over the proceeds of the sale of the misappropriated chips
                    and this was made clear by Lord Templeman in <em>AG v
                        Reid</em> in the passage of his judgment that has been set out at
                        <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above as well as at 338A–C of
                        <em>AG v Reid</em>, where he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>… Phipps v. Boardman</em> [1967] 2 A.C. 46
                        … demonstrates the strictness with which equity regards the conduct
                        of a fiduciary and the extent to which equity is willing to impose a
                        constructive trust on property obtained by a fiduciary by virtue of his
                        office. In that case a solicitor acting for trustees rescued the interests
                        of the trust in a private company by negotiating for a takeover bid in which
                        he himself took an interest. He acted in good faith throughout and <em>the information which the solicitor obtained about the company
                            in the takeover bid could never have been used by the
                            trustees</em>. Nevertheless the solicitor was held to be a
                        constructive trustee by a majority in the House of Lords because the
                        solicitor obtained the information which satisfied him that the purchase of
                        the shares in the takeover company would be a good investment and the
                        opportunity of acquiring the shares as a result of acting for certain
                        purposes on behalf of the trustees; see <em>per</em>
                        Lord Cohen, at p. 103. If a fiduciary acting honestly and in good faith and
                            <em>making a profit which his principal could not make
                            for himself</em> becomes a constructive trustee of that profit
                        then it seems to their Lordships that a fiduciary acting dishonestly and
                        criminally who accepts a bribe and thereby causes loss and damage to his
                        principal must also be a constructive trustee and must not be allowed by any
                        means to make any profit from his wrongdoing. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the contrary, it would be wrong to allow NTL to retain ownership of
                    the proceeds of the sale of the misappropriated chips in excess of the value of
                    the crushed chips, even if there is the expectation that they may be confiscated
                    from him on the application of the PP. NTL’s right of retention must be
                    considered separately from the liability to confiscation. If nothing is retained
                    by NTL, there will be nothing to confiscate from him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Thirdly, it was submitted that Centillion
                    “has not adduced any evidence as to the losses that it suffered”
                    from NTL’s actions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    Two responses can be made to the submission. Firstly, there can be no doubt that
                    when NTL misappropriated the chips, Centillion suffered loss, at the minimum, of
                    the value of the misappropriated chips. Secondly, and more importantly, loss is
                    not a requirement for a constructive trust, as was made clear by Morritt LJ in
                    the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>United Pan-Europe v
                        Deutsche Bank</em> [2000] 2 BCLC 461 at [47] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47.    … [T]he object of the … imposition
                            of a constructive trust is to ensure that the defaulting fiduciary does
                            not retain the profit; it is not to compensate the beneficiary for any
                            loss. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Morritt LJ was referring to constructive trusts of
                    the <em>AG v Reid</em> type, the same principle (that no
                    proof of loss is required) applies to constructive trusts
                generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Fourthly, the PP took issue that
                    “Centillion has failed to adduce any evidence as [<em>sic</em>] to prove which of the computer chips belonged to the
                    company at the time of misappropriation”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> implying that NTL’s
                    liability for breach of trust and the formation of any constructive trust should
                    be restricted to misappropriated chips which belonged to Centillion. That is a
                    departure from the basis of these confiscation proceedings that the PP is
                    pursuing. The PP, in his first set of written submissions, stated that he made
                    the application on the following ground:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    ... [NTL] had committed criminal breach of trust as
                            a servant ... by misappropriating computer chips sent to [Centillion]
                            for crushing. He repacked and sold these chips to buyers overseas and
                            received a total sum of over US$50 million as payment for the
                            goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the PP was stating that NTL had committed breach
                    of trust as a servant of Centillion in respect of all the chips which were
                    misappropriated and sold. The quoted statement correctly states that the offence
                    is constituted by a misappropriation that followed after an entrustment of
                    property. Neither the entrustment nor the misappropriation was conditional on
                    Centillion being the owner of the chips. It was sufficient that Centillion had
                    possession and control of the chips at that time and had entrusted them to NTL.
                    The same reasoning holds true for a finding in relation to a constructive trust:
                    it was not necessary for Centillion to have owned the chips for me to find that
                    NTL held them on trust for Centillion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In any event, the PP’s position was not
                    that Centillion did not own the chips at the times of misappropriation. His
                    position was that while he was satisfied that Centillion had paid the chip
                    manufacturers for the chips and that title in the chips passed upon payment, he
                    was unable to establish if the chips were misappropriated before or after
                    Centillion had paid for them (and therefore obtained title over them). In such a
                    situation s 112 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) applies.
                    This section provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>112</b>. When the question is whether any person
                        is owner of anything of which he is shown to be in possession, the burden of
                        proving that he is not the owner is on the person who affirms that he is not
                        the owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the chips were misappropriated while they were in
                    Centillion’s possession, Centillion was deemed to be the
                owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The PP also put up an argument based on policy
                    considerations, namely that: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">g.    There is the wider policy consideration that a
                            finding of a constructive trust on the terms sought by Centillion will
                            undermine the confiscation regime established by the CDSA as criminals
                            can exploit this by structuring their activities such that the benefits
                            they obtained from their claims can be recovered by their nominees
                            through the legal fiction of a “constructive
                            trust”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no explanation or elaboration of criminals’
                    alleged ability to exploit or take advantage of constructive trusts. More
                    pertinently, the PP was not saying that NTL could exploit the mechanism of a
                    constructive trust on the facts because he clearly could not. Properties falling
                    under a constructive trust would go to Centillion’s creditors under its
                    scheme of arrangement: none of them would have gone to NTL. In my view the
                    relevant policy considerations favour Centillion’s creditors, who have a
                    right to claim against Centillion’s assets, rather than the State, which
                    would receive any realised property as a windfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings on TBH’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     TBH asserted an interest in the 60% share of a
                    house at 95A Paya Lebar Crescent. That 60% share was registered in the name of
                    his sister TCH, with TBH being the registered owner of the other 40% of the
                    property, but the PP was only seeking to realise TCH’s 60% share of the
                    property. The basis of TBH’s claim was straightforward. He claimed that
                    there was an agreement between him and TCH that she held her 60% share on trust
                    for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In an affidavit filed on 21 October 2008
                    TBH explained the history of the acquisition of the property:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    … The said property was purchased in June
                            2002 for $1.25 million. It was purchased in my name and that of my
                            sister [TCH] as Tenants-in-Common. My sister held a 60% share in the
                            property whilst I held a 40% share in the said property. It was agreed
                            that out mother will have the absolute right to spend the remaining
                            years of her life there and together with the other siblings and we
                            would do all that was necessary to give her a good life. I was required
                            to pay a deposit of 20% of the purchase price of $1.25 million i.e.
                            approximately $250,000.00 with the balance to be raised from a bank in
                            the form of a loan. Another $300,000.00 to $400,000.00 was needed on
                            renovation works. Since the entire sum was quite substantial, I
                            requested my sister [TCH] for financial help and she
                        agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    My sister [TCH] extended to me a loan of
                            $150,000.00 and I forked out about S$100,000.00 to pay the initial
                            deposit of approximately $250,000.00. I paid the stamp fees. In the
                            course of finalizing the loan for the said property it became apparent
                            also that I alone would not qualify for the loan quantum and had to have
                            another sibling’s name inserted as co-owner and
                        borrower.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Under those circumstances, parameters and
                            undertakings were agreed. [TCH] and I were named by the Thor family to
                            be the legal owners of the said property as well as borrowers liable for
                            the mortgage of the said property to the bank. Thus, [TCH] and I have a
                            legal and moral obligation by virtue of our undertakings and agreements
                            to our siblings to protect the interest of the property for the benefit
                            of our mother and the Thor family. Since [TCH] was married into a family
                            which was financially sound, she was the obvious choice with no fear of
                            her turning around in future to assert her rights as a legal
                            owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Although she had a 60% share in the property, she
                            did not contribute towards the monthly instalments. It was a family
                            arrangement based on mutual trust. I have been paying all the monthly
                            instalments and my sister [TCH] did not make any monetary contribution
                            at all. The home was for my mother, my siblings and myself to stay and I
                            can say my sister [TCH] has no beneficial interest in the property
                            because I had already settled the debt of S$150,000.00 owed to my
                            sister, referred to in paragraph 5, when my business in Hong Kong
                            flourished. It was merely a family arrangement made to protect our
                            mother’s position in a home meant for the Thor family. I did not
                            anticipate that this family arrangement would place me and my family
                            members in such a predicament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this affidavit, TBH did not assert that he held a beneficial
                    interest in the 60% share of the property registered under TCH’s name. He
                    only went so far as to say (at para 12) that TCH “has no beneficial
                    interest whatsoever in the said property”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     TBH’s mother See Siew Geok
                    (“See”) also gave evidence to support his claim. She filed an
                    affidavit in which she revealed the Thor family’s concern over TBH’s
                    girlfriend/future wife:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    Although my daughter [TCH] had a 60% share in the
                            property, she did not contribute towards the initial deposit and/or
                            towards the monthly instalments. It was a family arrangement based on
                            mutual trust. My son, [TBH] have been paying all the monthly instalments
                            and my daughter [TCH] did not make any monetary contributions at all.
                            The home was for me and my children to stay and I can say my daughter
                            [TCH] has no beneficial interest in the property since [TBH] had already
                            repaid the $150,000.00 loan taken from [TCH]. It was merely a family
                            arrangement made to ensure that I would have a home till I die. We
                            certainly did not anticipate that this family arrangement would place us
                            in such a predicament.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    Last but not least, my son [TBH] who then had a
                            steady girlfriend was contemplating to marry her. All sorts of things
                            went through my mind and the minds of my other children including a
                            lurking fear that should their marriage fail, his wife would put a claim
                            to the property which belongs to the Thor family. Another compelling
                            reason for including [TCH] as a 60% legal owner was, in the event
                            [TBH’s] future wife asserts her influence over him, resulting in
                            [TBH] failing to fulfil his undertakings and responsibilities towards my

                            In the event she asserts her rights, there would be the possibility of

<p class="Judg-1">Counsel for TBH did not seek any clarification or qualification from

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">On the PP’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     After having considered the evidence adduced
                    and the issues raised by the parties, my orders were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     I certified that the properties in
                        the List of Realisable Properties (Appendix B) were realisable
                        properties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        PP was to have liberty to apply for further confiscation or realisation
                        orders (i) if fresh evidence is available on other properties, or (ii) upon
                        the production of admissible and sufficient evidence from Wee on the shares
                        and money held in the name of Ventures Trust (if this is done, the
                        consequence will be that the shares and money, which Tok has confirmed are
                        traceable to the proceeds of sale of the misappropriated chips, will not be
                        realisable as Centillion will have a constructive trust interest in them
                        (see <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above));</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"></a>(c)     I ordered costs to the PP to be paid
                        by NTL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I declined to issue a certificate under
                    s 10(2) of the CDSA on the amount recoverable under the confiscation order
                    because the amount would only be known after the realisation process is
                    completed, at which point the amount recovered can be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I did not make the other orders sought by the
                    PP because a receiver should be appointed for the realisable property as
                    provided in s 19(3) of the CDSA which empowers the court to appoint the
                    Public Trustee or any person as receiver in respect of realisable property. When
                    a receiver is appointed, further orders may be obtained under s 19(1) to
                    empower the receiver to realise the properties and generally to complete the
                    realisation process.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">On UYH’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I declared that the money in UYH’s bank
                    accounts corresponding to para 5.18 of OS 785/2008 was not realisable property,
                    and I ordered costs to UYH to be paid by the PP.</p>

                    interest under a constructive trust in the properties listed in the List of
                    Constructive Trust Properties (Appendix C), and ordered that Centillion was to
                    have half the costs of its application (as it had failed in its claim based on a
                    judgment debt but succeeded on its claim based on constructive trust), to be
                    paid by the PP.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Strenuous submissions were made on behalf of
                    the PP that the PP should not be ordered to pay costs. The thrust of the
                    submissions was, firstly, that the PP was discharging his legal duty when he
                    filed the confiscation proceedings. Secondly, it was submitted that throughout
                    the proceedings the PP had acted reasonably and in good faith.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Although this was not stated expressly, the PP
                    was essentially relying on the principle enunciated in <em>Baxendale-Walker v Law Society</em> [2008] 1 WLR 426
                        (“<em>Baxendale-Walker</em>”), a decision
                    of the English Court of Appeal. <em>Baxendale-Walker</em>
                    was discussed and applied by the Court of Appeal in <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Top Ten Entertainment Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR
                    1279 (“<em>Top Ten</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The facts of <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> were as set out in the headnote of the report
                    of the case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Law Society [of England and Wales] instigated disciplinary proceedings
                        against the solicitor in the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. One of the
                        two allegations of conduct unbefitting a solicitor was not proved but the
                        second was admitted and the tribunal found the solicitor guilty of
                        unbefitting conduct and suspended him from practice for three years.
                        Pursuant to section 47(2) of the Solicitors Act 1974, the tribunal made an
                        order that the Law Society pay 30% of the solicitor’s costs of the
                        proceedings since the first allegation had not been proved and a greater
                        proportion of the solicitor’s costs had been incurred in defending
                        that allegation. The solicitor appealed to the Divisional Court of the
                        Queen’s Bench Division against the sentence of suspension from
                        practice. The Law Society cross-appealed against the order for costs. The
                        Divisional Court dismissed the solicitor’s appeal but allowed the Law
                        Society’s cross-appeal and ordered the solicitor to pay 60% of the Law
                        Society’s cost, holding that the principles relating to costs in
                        proceedings brought in the public interest in exercise of regulatory
                        functions differed from those which applied to ordinary civil
                        litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Section 47(2) of the Solicitors’ Act
                    1974 (c 47) (UK) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    … [O]n the
                            hearing of any application or complaint made to the tribunal under this
                            Act ... the tribunal shall have power to make such order as it may think
                            fit, and any such order may in particular include provision for any of
                            the following matters —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) the payment by any party of costs or a contribution towards costs
                            of such amount as the tribunal may consider reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The discretion that the tribunal has to order costs is
                    broad, with no requirement that costs should generally follow the
                event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In <em>Baxendale-Walker</em>, Sir Igor Judge P stated at [34] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    … [T]he Law Society has an independent
                            obligation of its own to ensure that the [Solicitors Disciplinary
                            Tribunal] is enabled to fulfil its statutory responsibilities. The
                            exercise of this regulatory function places the Law Society in a wholly
                            different position to that of a party to ordinary civil litigation. The
                            normal approach to costs decisions in such litigation—dealing with
                            it very broadly, that properly incurred costs should follow the
                            “event” and be paid by the unsuccessful party—would
                            appear to have no direct application to disciplinary proceedings against
                            a solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He also stated at [39]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    … Unless the complaint is improperly
                            brought, or, for example, proceeds as it did in <em>Gorlov's</em> case [2001] ACD 393, as a “shambles from
                            start to finish”, when the Law Society is discharging its
                            responsibilities as a regulator of the profession, an order for costs
                            should not ordinarily be made against it on the basis that costs follow
                            the event. The “event” is simply one factor for
                            consideration. It is not a starting point. There is no assumption that
                            an order for costs in favour of a solicitor who has successfully
                            defeated an allegation of professional misconduct will automatically
                            follow. One crucial feature which should inform the tribunal’s
                            costs decision is that the proceedings were brought by the Law Society
                            in exercise of its regulatory responsibility, in the public interest and
                            the maintenance of proper professional standards. For the Law Society to
                            be exposed to the risk of an adverse costs order simply because properly
                            brought proceedings were unsuccessful might have a chilling effect on
                            the exercise of its regulatory obligations, to the public disadvantage.
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In <em>Top Ten</em>, a
                    client of a solicitor made a complaint to the Law Society of Singapore. An
                    Inquiry Committee formed by the Law Society recommended that the Council of the
                    Law Society dismiss the complaint and impose a $500 fine on the solicitor. The
                    Council accepted the Inquiry Committee’s recommendations. The client
                    applied for a review of the Council’s decision under s 96(1) of the
                    Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“LPA”). The
                    judge hearing the review application directed the Law Society to apply to the
                    Chief Justice to appoint a disciplinary tribunal to investigate the
                    solicitor’s conduct and ordered the Law Society to pay half of the
                    client’s costs of the review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The judge made the costs order against the Law
                    Society under s 96(4) of the LPA, which provided that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    At the hearing of
                            the application, the Judge may make an order —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) affirming the determination of the
                            Council; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) directing the Society to apply to
                            the Chief Justice for the appointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and such order for the payment of costs as may be just.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Law Society appealed against the costs order. In the judgment of
                    the Court of Appeal delivered by Chan Sek Keong CJ, he stated at [24] that the principle enunciated in
                        <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> (as set out in the quotations
                    above at <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a>) would apply to the Law
                    Society if it was acting as a regulating body because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    … When performing regulatory functions which
                            they are charged to do, public bodies should be protected from having to
                            pay costs unless they are proved to have acted in bad faith or are
                            guilty of gross dereliction. In our view, <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> enunciates a salutary
                        principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal went on to hold that the Law Society was
                    acting as a regulating body.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     However, that did not dispose of the costs
                    question. The Court also considered the effect of O 59 r 3(2) of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of
                    Court”), which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    If the Court in the exercise of its discretion
                            sees fit to make any order as to the costs of or incidental to any
                            proceedings, <em>the Court shall</em>, subject to
                            this Order, <em>order the costs to follow the
                                event</em>, except when it appears to the Court that in the
                            circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the
                            whole or any part of the costs. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and came to the following conclusion at [34]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    ... [W]e do not think Pt VII of the LPA affects the
                            rationale of the <em>Baxendale-Walker</em>
                            principle or its application to the Law Society in any way, <em>unless O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court governs the issue
                                of costs with respect to proceedings under Pt VII</em>.
                            In our view, disciplinary proceedings against advocates and solicitors
                            under the LPA are specialised forms of inquisitorial proceedings with
                            adversarial elements (before the IC and the DT) and judicial proceedings
                            (before the judge and the court of 3 Judges of the Supreme Court)
                                <em>to which the Rules of Court are not
                                applicable</em> because they are not civil proceedings as
                            defined in those Rules. Hence, O 59 r 3(2) does not apply to Pt VII of
                            the LPA. In any case, <em>it is not necessary to apply O
                                59 r 3(2)</em> because Pt VII of the LPA provides a
                            comprehensive framework for disciplinary proceedings, and provides in ss
                            93(2A), 95(3), 96(4), 97(4), 100(6) and 103(3) a comprehensive costs
                            regime with respect to such proceedings. … [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Court referred to another decision of the
                    English Court of Appeal, <em>R (Perinpanathan) v City of
                        Westminster Magistrates’ Court and another</em> [2010]
                    1 WLR 1506 (“<em>Perinpanathan</em>”). This case also dealt with the question of
                    costs, but on facts which were more akin to those in the present case. While
                        <em>Top Ten</em> and <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> dealt with costs in disciplinary proceedings
                    against solicitors, <em>Perinpanathan</em> dealt with costs
                    in proceedings for the forfeiture of property under the English Proceeds of
                    Crime Act 2002 (c 29) (UK).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The facts of <em>Perinpanathan</em> were as set out in the headnote of the report of
                    the case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The claimant’s daughter, aged 15, flew from London to Singapore with
                        a bag containing over £150,000 in cash which had been packed by the
                        claimant, who ran a foreign exchange business. On arrival in Singapore the
                        daughter was refused entry. She returned to London where the police seized
                        and detained the cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 on the basis that
                        there were reasonable grounds to suspect that it was intended for use in
                        unlawful conduct, namely terrorism. The Commissioner of Police for the
                        Metropolis applied under section 298 of the 2002 Act for the forfeiture of
                        the cash. The magistrates dismissed that application, accepting evidence
                        produced by the claimant that the cash had been intended for lawful
                        purposes, but refused to make an order for costs under section 64 of the
                        Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 on the basis that the police had had
                        reasonable grounds for their suspicion that the cash had been intended for
                        use in unlawful conduct, both when seizing the cash and when applying for
                        its forfeiture. The claimant sought judicial review of the
                        magistrates’ decision to make no order as to costs, but did not
                        challenge the finding that the police had had reasonable grounds for their
                        suspicion throughout. The Divisional Court dismissed the claimant’s
                        claim for judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     As explained at [11]–[12] of
                        <em>Perinpanathan</em>, the Magistrates’ Court
                    had the power to award costs for such proceedings under s 64(1) of the
                    Magistrates’ Court Act 1980 (c 43) (UK) (“MCA”), which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    On the hearing of a
                            complaint, a magistrates’ court shall have power in its discretion
                            to make such order as to costs–</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) on making the order for which the complaint is made, to be paid by
                            the defendant to the complainant;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) on dismissing the complaint, to be paid by the complainant to the
                            defendant,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">as it thinks just and reasonable ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The court in <em>Perinpanathan</em> applied the <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> principle and dismissed the claimant’s
                    appeal. However, Stanley Burnton LJ set out the following caveat to the
                    principle at [40]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    … A successful private party to proceedings
                            to which the principle applies may none the less be awarded all or part
                            of his costs if the conduct of the public authority in question
                            justifies it. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury MR elaborated on this caveat at
                        [77]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77    The effect of our decision is that a person in the
                            position of the claimant, who has done nothing wrong, may normally not
                            be able to recover the costs of vindicating her rights against the
                            police in proceedings under section 298 of the 2002 Act, where the
                            police have behaved reasonably. In my view, this means that magistrates
                            should exercise particular care when considering whether the police have
                            acted reasonably in a case where there is an application for costs
                            against them under section 64. It would be wrong to invoke the wisdom of
                            hindsight or to set too exacting a standard, but, particularly given the
                            understandable resentment felt by a person in the position of the
                            claimant if no order for costs is made, and the general standards of
                            behaviour that can properly be expected from the police, <em>it must be right to scrutinise their behaviour in relation
                                to the seizure, the detention, and the confiscation proceedings,
                                with some care when deciding whether they acted reasonably and
                                properly</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The position under s 64(1) of the MCA in
                    relation to forfeiture proceedings is that while a Magistrates’ Court can
                    make costs orders as it thinks just and reasonable, the police are protected
                    against costs in unsuccessful forfeiture applications if they had behaved
                    reasonably during the proceedings. If they had behaved unreasonably that
                    protection would not apply. This qualification to the <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> principle is appropriate to ensure that the
                    forfeiture powers of a public authority are used reasonably and properly, and if
                    they are not, costs may be ordered. If unreasonableness in the conduct of
                    forfeiture proceedings can result in an order of costs in cases where the
                        <em>Baxendale-Walker</em> principle applies,
                    unreasonable conduct would carry even more weight in proceedings where the
                    governing rule states that costs should generally follow the
                event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The CDSA does not contain any specific costs
                    provisions. In terms of procedure under the CDSA generally, s 62 provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>62</b>.    Rules of Court may
                            provide for the manner in which proceedings under this Act may be
                            commenced or carried on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">An order in the Rules of Court, O 89A, caters specifically
                    for proceedings under the CDSA. All the applications in the present case were
                    regulated by this order. Order 89A rule 2 deals with applications for
                    confiscation orders, O 89A r 3 deals with applications for the protection
                    of the rights of third parties, and O 89A r 9 deals with the realisation of
                    property. It is quite clear that O 89A regulates applications for
                    confiscation and realisation orders. As the Rules of Court govern applications
                    under the CDSA, O 59 would regulate the award of costs in such
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     There was no question that the PP was
                    performing a public function in making an application under the CDSA against NTL
                    and in relation to properties connected to him. However, for the reasons stated
                    above, in the circumstances the starting point on costs in this case was that
                    costs follow the event, as prescribed in O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court.
                    That, however, was only the starting point: it did not have to be adhered to if
                    the circumstances justified a departure. The fact that the PP was carrying out
                    his public duty to proceed under the CDSA against NTL was a relevant factor, but
                    it was not a conclusive factor. The manner in which the PP dealt with the
                    applications of UYH and Centillion also had to be considered. The PP’s
                    conduct of the proceedings had to be reasonable for me to consider not awarding
                    costs against him, but as I have noted above (<em>eg</em>
                    at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>–<a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> and <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>–<a href="#p1_63">[63]</a>), some of
                    the positions taken by the PP fell short of that. That led to the continuation
                    of hearings which may have been unnecessary if a more careful approach had been
                    taken. In the circumstances, it was appropriate that costs be ordered to follow
                    the event.</p>
