</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Their lives embodied the traditions, values and success of our pioneer generation. They became Singapore citizens, started a small business, bought a Housing Development Board (“<span class="font-weight-bold">HDB</span>”) flat and raised five children. Mr Kua passed away in 2012 and Mdm Ng sadly now suffers from dementia. Unfortunately, their children are embroiled in a dispute with their daughter-in-law over the ownership of assets which the children say rightly belong to Mdm Ng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Mr Kua Swee Lin (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Lin</span>”), acting as deputy for his mother, Mdm Ng, seeks, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, declarations that the respondents, his brother Mr Kua Swee Hor (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Hor</span>”) and Hor’s ex-wife, Ms Ho Kim Yan (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Ho</span>”), hold on trust for Mdm Ng (a) Blk 99 Bedok North Avenue 4 #21-1906, Singapore 460099 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Flat</span>"); and (b) 50% of the net proceeds, amounting to a sum of $237,822.74 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">GMP Proceeds</span>”), from the sale of 6001 Beach Road #02-54 Golden Mile Tower, Singapore 199589 (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">GMP</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Flat is currently in the names of Hor and Ho as joint tenants. In 1978, the Flat was acquired in Mr Kua’s sole name. In 2004, he included Hor’s name as a joint tenant. A year after Mr Kua passed away in 2012, Hor included Ho as a joint tenant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Hor acquired the GMP together with his friend, Mr Gu Pei Hua (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Gu</span>”), on 5 November 2013. In August 2022, Hor sold his half share in the GMP to Gu and the GMP Proceeds are currently held by Hor’s solicitors in the conveyance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Lin and Hor maintain that the Flat is held by Hor and Ho on a resulting or constructive trust for Mdm Ng. Ho denies the said trust. It is her case that Mr Kua had gifted the Flat to Hor, and Hor had thereafter gifted it to her. She has filed a counterclaim for an order that Hor buys her share in the Flat. Lin and Hor also claim that Mdm Ng had largely funded the purchase of Hor’s share in the GMP on the understanding that Hor would hold that share, and the proceeds of its sale, on trust for Mdm Ng. Ho similarly denies that trust – she claims that the GMP Proceeds belong to Hor absolutely and are matrimonial property that should be dealt with in their ongoing matrimonial proceedings. Ho claims that Lin, Hor and their siblings have contrived both trusts to deprive her of her rightful share in these assets now that her marriage with Hor has broken down.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I dismiss all the parties’ claims with respect to the Flat, and Lin and Hor’s claims of a trust over the GMP Proceeds. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Mdm Ng and Mr Kua had five children, who are, from the eldest to the youngest: Ms Kua Swee Hoon (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Hoon</span>”), Lin, Mr Kua Swee Leong (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Leong</span>”), Ms Kua Swee Hong (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Hong</span>”) and Hor (collectively but excluding Leong, the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Children</span>”).

</div> I accept Lin and Hor’s explanation, through their respective counsel, that they needed time to get the necessary evidence and resolve certain issues between the Children. The first AOM was filed on 17 January 2022 and thereafter, there were several case conferences. Hor’s counsel informed the other Children that he could not act for them. Lin’s counsel disclosed at the hearing that there had been some uncertainty amongst the Children (other than Hor) as to who should be appointed as Mdm Ng's deputy and concerns about costs. These caused some delay. Hoon, Hong and Lin had also filed statutory declarations, hoping that these would be sufficient to persuade Ho to drop her claims on the Flat and the GMP.

</div> Ho’s counsel accepted that the FJC had proceeded with discovery and interrogatories in the matrimonial proceedings while the Mental Capacity Act Application and this application were being prepared and dealt with. I also accept that Lin’s counsel had not been aware of the timelines in the matrimonial proceedings, including the deadline for Ho and Hor to file their second AOMs; it follows that the fact that this application was filed just before the parties were due to file and exchange their second AOMs

It would be in both Ho and Hor’s interests for the matrimonial dispute to be resolved as soon as possible. Further, as far as Hor was concerned, he was prepared for the dispute over the Flat to be dealt with under the matrimonial proceedings.

Ho’s counsel argued that it did not make sense for Ho to initiate proceedings as she had the “default legal position” and sought merely to maintain the status quo. But Ho is not merely seeking to preserve the default position: she wants an order for the Flat to be sold, which she is seeking in this application via her counterclaim.

</div> Ho’s counsel explained at the hearing that Ho sought to rely on “alternative cases on the same facts”. But that was also not the case, as Ho’s Counsel also reserved the right to rely on additional facts in the matrimonial proceedings to argue that the Flat is matrimonial property. This is not permissible. Whether the Flat is matrimonial property is a mixed question of fact and law on which Ho cannot take inconsistent or different factual positions. Ho effectively conceded this at the hearing by withdrawing her claim that the Flat is matrimonial property. In the circumstances, she could have initiated these proceedings herself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Fourth, if Ho believed that Hor was deliberately delaying matters, she could have sought the necessary orders against him in the matrimonial proceedings. There is no evidence that Ho had done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the circumstances, the facts do not support a finding of an abuse of process, and certainly do not warrant dismissing this application summarily. I disagree with Ho’s submission that this action was commenced for the collateral purpose of oppressing her and subjecting her to a battle of attrition.

In my view, the critical issue is whether the party bearing the burden of proof on an issue has discharged that burden. Generally speaking, where parties have narrated different accounts and there is limited or no documentary or corroborative evidence, the dispute(s) can usually only be resolved with cross-examination. However, where the party with the legal burden has adduced sufficient evidence such that the evidential burden has shifted to the other party, the failure of the latter to adduce contrary evidence or to undermine the former’s evidence via cross-examination may result in the former successfully discharging its legal burden of proof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East Ltd</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855, the Court of Appeal held at [60] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… at the start of the plaintiff’s case, the legal burden of proving the existence of any relevant fact that the plaintiff must prove and the evidential burden of adducing some (not inherently incredible) evidence of the existence of such fact coincide. Upon adduction of that evidence, the evidential burden shifts to the defendant, as the case may be, to adduce some evidence in rebuttal. If no evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the court may conclude from the evidence of the plaintiff that the legal burden is also discharged and making a finding on the fact against the defendant. If, on the other hand, evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the evidential burden shifts back to the plaintiff. If, ultimately, the evidential burden comes to rest on the defendant, the legal burden of proof of that relevant fact would have been discharged by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 63 similarly recognised at [30] that ss 103 and 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) place the burden of proving a fact on the party who asserts the existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact; the burden may then shift to the other party to contradict, weaken or explain away the evidence led.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 <span class="font-italic">Registrar of Vehicles v Komoco Motors Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 340 at [38] (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Registrar of Vehicles</span>”) provides an illustration of this principle, and the relevant part is reproduced below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having considered the Registrar’s Affidavit, we were of the view that the Judge was wrong not to believe that the Registrar had genuinely considered Komoco’s representations for two reasons.

Ho also relies on the presumption of advancement to rebut any resulting trust that may arise in Hor’s favour. This question forms the crux of the dispute, and I deal with it first. But there is more: a finding that Hor had gifted a share of the Flat to Ho is predicated on Hor being the absolute owner of the Flat on 10 December 2013. I deal with this issue second.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The parties cited several authorities – I found two of particular relevance: <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin v Lim Sai Ing Peggy </span>[2022] 1 SLR 873 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Hin</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni and another v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie (formerly known as Tay Yeng Choo Jessy) and another</span> [2020] SGCA 58 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span>”). I summarise them below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin</span>, a father had added his daughter (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Respondent Daughter</span>”) as a joint tenant to a flat of which he was previously the sole owner. After the father died, by operation of the right of survivorship, the Respondent Daughter became the sole owner of the flat. The father’s executrix, one of his other daughters, brought an application for a declaration that the Respondent Daughter held the flat on trust for the father. The Appellate Division laid out the following approach:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, while a gratuitous transfer of property normally gives rise to a presumption of resulting trust in the transferor’s favour (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [34] and [46]), the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) made clear (at [52]) that the court is not obliged to rely on such a presumption if there is ‘direct <span class="font-italic">evidence that may adequately reveal the intention of the transferor</span>’ [emphasis in original]. As such, a resulting trust may arise independently of the presumption of resulting trust as long as it can be shown that the transfer was not intended to benefit the transferee; and, in a similar vein, a resulting trust may not necessarily arise even if there was no consideration for the transfer, if it can be shown that the transfer was indeed intended to benefit the transferee: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [35]. It is only in the “rather limited and exceptional situation” when the court is “not able to find any clear intention” or if the evidence is “inconclusive either way as to what the [transferor’s] real intention might be” that the court should apply the presumption: see <span class="font-italic">Lim Chen Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin Peng</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 at [116], endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [52].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Appellate Division found the High Court judge’s approach of relying on the title deed of the flat and the transfer document incorrect (<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin</span> at [11]), and that they are not “conclusive of [the father’s] actual intent or state of mind as at the time”. Instead, the Appellate Division looked at the evidence as a whole and concluded that “there were several reasonably cogent indicia that there was no such positive donative intent on [the father’s] part”, which included (a) the father’s illiteracy and limited education; (b) that the father had continued to exercise control over the flat as if he was its sole owner; and (c) the lack of evidence that the father shared a particularly close relationship with the Respondent Daughter. The Appellate Division concluded that the Respondent Daughter held the flat on a resulting trust for the father’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span>, a couple purchased a flat as joint tenants in 1999. Their son married, notwithstanding the couple’s objections to the marriage. Later, the son and daughter-in-law moved into the flat, were added as joint tenants in 2011 and contributed to the mortgage. The son and daughter-in-law underwent a divorce and the daughter-in-law commenced proceedings to determine their respective beneficial interests in the flat. The High Court judge decided that the daughter-in-law was entitled to an 8.11% beneficial interest in the flat by application of a resulting trust, which arose due to her contributions to its purchase price (<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span> at [2]). The presumption of advancement operated in favour of the son, who was thus constituted as a co-owner of the beneficial interest in the flat in equal shares with the couple; accordingly, the couple and the son each had a 30.63% beneficial interest (<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span> at [2]). The Court of Appeal found that the High Court judge had correctly rejected the couple’s contention that they did not know about or remember signing transfer forms (<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni </span>at [6]) but had reached an “implausible ruling” in response to the couple’s argument that they never intended in effect to gift a half share in the flat to either the son or the daughter-in-law (<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni </span>at [6]). The Court of Appeal pointed out that the High Court judge ought to have considered the following: (a) the presumption of advancement in favour of the son at the time he was added as a co-owner, if any, would have been extremely weak, given that the couple disapproved of the son’s choice of spouse (<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni </span>at [8]); and (b) the couple had faced persistent difficulties in making payment on the mortgage and it was unlikely that the couple had realistically contemplated making a gift of a quarter or a third of their beneficial interest in the flat to the son. Instead, the primary concern was for the son and daughter-in-law to be added as co-owners so that they could use moneys in their Central Provident Fund to help pay part of the mortgage (<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni </span>at [9]). The Court of Appeal therefore found that, absent any evidence that the parties were to hold the beneficial interest in a proportion different from their respective contributions to the purchase price, the presumption of resulting trust applied, and each person held a share of the beneficial interest reflecting their respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the flat. Thus, the couple jointly held an 89.45% share of the flat, the son held a 2.44% share and the daughter-in-law held an 8.11% share (<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni </span>at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Hor intended to give Ho a share of the Flat </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54  As held in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin</span>, it is insufficient to simply look at the transfer document to ascertain the intention of the transferor. Instead, the totality of the evidence must be considered (<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin</span> at [8] and [11]). Crucially, the court there pointed out that the first step is to analyse <span class="font-italic">the evidence of the intention of the transferor</span>, and it is only if the said evidence is <span class="font-italic">inconclusive</span> that the presumption of a resulting trust or advancement operates (as the case may be). I add one more point on the presumption of advancement specifically: the court in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 533 found at [19] that the presumption of advancement is “not a rule of substantive law but an evidentiary tool of adjectival law”. Accordingly, the presumption of advancement, as an evidential tool, should not be used or allowed to supplant actual evidence as to the intention of the transferor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Hor), where such evidence is available.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I find, based on all the evidence, that Hor had no intention of giving Ho a half share of the Flat when he included her name in the HDB Lease Document.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, it is Hor’s evidence that after Mr Kua’s death on 4 October 2012, he was required, under the HDB regulations, to include a family member as a joint owner of the Flat to form a family nucleus.

There is no evidence that Hor and the others were on bad terms; instead, the evidence suggests that the Children got along prior to Hor’s inclusion of Ho’s name: (a) they were all contributing to looking after Mdm Ng;

At the hearing, Ho’s counsel was only able to point to one act done by Ho which might be regarded as an assertion of ownership, namely, that she had purchased furniture for the Flat and relied on Ho’s AOM filed on 12 January 2023 in the matrimonial proceedings. However, it is not clear from the AOM that the furniture purchased by Ho was for the Flat; the reference to furniture falls within a section titled “Contributions to the matrimonial assets”, which includes other such items as the family car and the laptops used by Hor and Ho’s children, and which likely relate to Ho’s own household and not the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Sixth, Ho and Hor never asserted, whether by words or conduct, prior to the divorce, that the Flat was theirs. Indeed, Ho does not appear to have taken any interest in the Flat at all. Instead, it was the Kua family members who continued to take care of it and make all arrangements: Mr Kua and Mdm Ng continued to live there and pay for their expenses while Mr Kua was still alive, Lin and Hor shared in the expenses of the Flat and care for their parents, and the sisters contributed moneys sporadically.

</div> This is probably a rare instance of a legal owner admitting the existence of a trust against his interests. Be that has it may, Hor could not have intended to given Ho a half-share if he did not believe the Flat was his to give. As stated above, I cannot accept this assertion of Hor’s belief at face value given his current dispute with Ho.

Lin’s counsel clarified that the purchase of the Flat had been funded from the compensation funds received from the compulsory acquisition of the Killiney Property and from the Business which both Mr Kua and Mdm Ng operated. Lin and Hor state that the Flat was only registered in Mr Kua’s name because he was “a traditional patriarch” who bought into the “traditional notion that women had no right to hold property or did not have to hold property in any event because they would be provided for by their husbands”.

While Mdm Ng had assisted him in the Business, it does not mean she held a share in it. This was the family’s only source of income and it is not unreasonable that Mdm Ng would assist without any expectation or belief of a proprietary interest.

Lin’s counsel submitted to the contrary at the hearing, that Mdm Ng and the other Children “were also there” at the time Mr Kua added Hor as a co-owner of the Flat; further, since the entire family was involved in the decision, the Children could therefore give evidence on Mr Kua’s intention. But this submission is not supported by the evidence before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The evidence concerning Mr Kua’s expressed intention is, on its face, that Mr Kua intended for Mdm Ng to continue living in the Flat after his demise and expected the Children to take care of her: he had expressly stated this to Hoon.

There is no evidence that he was Mr Kua or Mdm Ng’s favourite child. Neither was he closer to them or more involved than the other Children in looking after them.

</div>
</div> which meant Mr Kua did not have the option of including any of their names to the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Ho’s counsel argued at the hearing that there was reason for Mr Kua to prefer Hor. He argued that (a) consistent with Mr Kua’s views and values, Mr Kua would give the Flat to his son(s) and not his daughter(s); and (b) of the three sons, Leong was estranged from the family, Lin had taken over the Business from Mr Kua, and it was therefore not surprising that Mr Kua would give the Flat to Hor. The evidence does not support that conclusion:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, while Mr Kua may not have included Mdm Ng’s name in the Flat for “traditional” reasons (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the husband would own the property and provide for his wife), it does not follow that he would only give his assets to his sons to the exclusion of his daughters. Further, that same traditional outlook may also mean that he would <span class="font-italic">put the Flat in the </span><span class="font-italic">name of a son</span> because he expected the son to be in charge after his passing – but this does not mean that he intended to <span class="font-italic">give </span>the Flat only to that son. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the evidence suggests that Lin, the older brother, was at least equally involved in the family’s affairs. But the Flat could not be put in his name as he already owned a HDB flat. This suggests that Hor’s name was included because he was the only option, and not because Mr Kua intended to give the Flat to him. Ho’s argument that Lin had already benefitted from acquiring the Business is speculative – there is no evidence that Mr Kua based his decision on that fact; further Lin states that he purchased the Business from Mr Kua,

</div> it was not given to him. Ho points out that no details are given of the consideration, but this point was only made in Ho’s oral submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The evidence therefore suggests that it was not Mr Kua’s intention to gift the Flat to Hor. Rather, it appears that Mr Kua’s main concern was to include a joint tenant to the Flat to ensure that the said joint tenant could handle administrative matters concerning the Flat upon Mr Kua’s passing, thereby sparing Mdm Ng the trouble. In the circumstances, Hor was the only one among the Children who was eligible to be added as a joint tenant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82  Fourth, there is no evidence that Mr Kua had, by words or conduct, asserted that he was making an outright gift of the Flat to Hor. Nothing changed after Hor’s name was included. Mr Kua and Mdm Ng continued to live in the Flat and pay the expenses (at [64] and [65] above). At the hearing, Ho’s counsel accepted that in the eight or so years between Mr Kua’s addition of Hor as co-owner of the Flat and Mr Kua’s passing, Mr Kua was regarded as the owner of the Flat and Hor did not exercise any right of ownership. This constituted objective evidence of Mr Kua’s exercise of control over the Flat as if he were the sole owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Fifth, Hor does not appear to have believed that he had gained ownership of the Flat: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Like what happened later in 2013 (see above at [60]), there is no evidence that Hor even discussed the inclusion of his name with Ho in 2004. Ho and Hor were on good terms then. If it was a gift, it would have been significant. The lack of discussion suggests that Hor did not consider the inclusion of his name a significant matter, but rather a matter of convenience.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Hor did not exercise ownership rights over the Flat. Mr Kua continued to do so (at [82] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is no evidence that Hor bore any greater expense than Mdm Ng or the other Children as the Flat’s joint owner, took a greater interest in the Flat or bore a greater share of responsibility to look after Mr Kua or Mdm Ng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I note that Lin and Hor take varying positions as to who Hor is holding the Flat on trust for, both before and after Mr Kua’s passing:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Lin’s position: It is not clear whose benefit Lin claims Hor held the Flat for before Mr Kua’s passing since Lin suggests that it was held for the benefit of Mr Kua and the Children,

In the circumstances, given that Mr Kua’s instructions were limited to Mdm Ng being taken care of and that Hor did not give any consideration for the inclusion of his name in the Flat, I find that Hor held the Flat on a resulting trust for Mr Kua, and after Mr Kua’s passing, for Mr Kua’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In any event, and relevant to the first issue discussed above, I accept that Hor did not believe that he owned the Flat (at [67] above).

</div> At the hearing, Hor belatedly applied for leave to file an affidavit from Gu to explain this discrepancy, arguing that they had no notice of this argument as it was only raised in Ho’s written submissions. I denied the application. It is for Lin and Hor to put all the relevant evidence before the court before they proceed with the hearing. The bank book is the only document purportedly evidencing the source of the $100,000, and Lin and Hor must have realized the significance of the dates. Indeed, Hor only made the application to file an affidavit from Gu mid-way through the hearing after I questioned why there was no affidavit explaining the discrepancy in the dates.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Third, Hor’s conduct is not consistent with him holding the GMP Proceeds on trust for Mdm Ng. Ho points out that Hor acted as though the GMP was his own investment by declaring it as his property and paying tax on the rental proceeds he received.

</div> It is plausible that Hor would therefore do these acts without consulting with Mdm Ng, particularly given her deteriorating health. He certainly could not consult her on the sale given her dementia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 However, Hor’s proposed treatment of the GMP Proceeds, which Lin agrees with, is inconsistent with their case. Hor’s proposed apportionment of the GMP Proceeds to Mdm Ng is not consistent with his case that $100,000 of the purchase price of the GMP was Mdm Ng’s moneys. I reproduce the calculations made by Hor below:

</div> He thereby asserts that the GMP Proceeds should be split between Mdm Ng and him in this ratio. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The main difficulty with this computation is that Hor allocates the rent collected entirely to himself. But if he is holding a (substantial) part of the GMP on trust for Mdm Ng, the rental income received should be allocated in the same proportion between them, thus adding to her contribution. On Ho’s calculation, if the rent had been properly allocated to Mdm Ng, her share of the GMP Proceeds would be about 97%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Hor’s calculation of Mdm Ng’s share of the GMP Proceeds reflects that he regarded the entirety of the rental as belonging to him, which in turn suggests that Hor considered the half share of the GMP was owned by him absolutely. If there was a trust in favour of Mdm Ng, Hor appears to be seeking a larger proportion of the GMP Proceeds for himself to the detriment of Mdm Ng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Surprisingly, Lin chose not to address this issue and continued, without explanation, to align his position with Hor’s although it was to the detriment of Mdm Ng.
