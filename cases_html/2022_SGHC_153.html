The defendant therefore sought to recover those amounts from the plaintiff in the Arbitration by way of its counterclaims. Among its other claims, the defendant counterclaimed for the following:

</div> On 25 August 2014, the Arbitrator issued the 2014 Award. In the 2014 Award, the Arbitrator allowed the plaintiff’s claim for outstanding payments due under the Purchase Agreement, and also allowed the defendant’s counterclaims in part. The Arbitrator found that the plaintiff was liable to the defendant for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims. However, the Arbitrator observed that there was a need for “some degree of caution” as it appeared that the defendant had not paid RWS for the sums due under the Nitrogen and Removal Claims.

On the same date, and without prejudice to its application for the Further Award, the defendant also issued a notice of arbitration, purporting to commence fresh arbitration proceedings against the plaintiff under the Arbitration Agreement claiming payment for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims (the “Notice of Arbitration”).

In the 2014 Award, the Arbitrator expressly noted that there were two ways to prevent the defendant from obtaining a windfall in respect of the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, drawing support from the decision of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Biffa Waste Services Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Maschinenfabrik Ernst Hese GMBH and another </span>[2008] EWHC 2210 (TCC) (“<span class="font-italic">Biffa Waste</span>”). These were to (a) adjourn the decision on quantum to a later date; or (b) to make an award on the condition that money is paid to a third party. The Arbitrator ultimately chose the second option, given that he ordered the plaintiff to make payment to the defendant for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims on the condition that the defendant made a corresponding payment to RWS (<span class="font-italic">per</span> the orders made by the Arbitrator at [9]–[10] above). The Arbitrator therefore did not choose to adjourn the decision on quantum, or reserve jurisdiction in that respect. There was also no <span class="font-italic">express </span>reservation of jurisdiction in the 2014 Award.

</div> The 2014 Award should be read together with the affidavit of Mr Shyam M Sidhwani (“Mr Sidhwani”), which was filed and relied upon by the defendant in the Arbitration. Mr Sidhwani’s affidavit contains a breakdown of the items that comprise the Nitrogen Claim and their corresponding cost, amounting to a total of S$1,099,162.46 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the maximum quantum that the Arbitrator awarded to the defendant for the Nitrogen Claim in the 2014 Award). Thus, in relation to the Nitrogen Claim, the defendant only needs to provide the plaintiff with evidence of which items (as listed in Mr Sidhwani’s affidavit) the defendant has paid DCP Sentosa for, in order for the plaintiff’s liability to pay the defendant to crystallise. As for the Removal Claim, the defendant similarly only needs to provide the plaintiff with proof that it has paid DCP Sentosa a certain sum, following which the defendant would be entitled to demand that same sum from the plaintiff. In other words, there is no need for a further award to determine the amount payable by the plaintiff to the defendant for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims.

In this regard, the defendant highlights that it is the plaintiff’s position that the defendant is not entitled to commence a fresh arbitration to claim payment for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims (as noted above at [14]). The defendant is also unable to request for an additional award under s 43(4) of the AA, given that the 30-day timeline to do so has passed. Further, the defendant claims that it would be unable to obtain leave to enforce the Arbitrator’s orders (as stated in the 2014 Award) in respect of the Nitrogen and Removal claims, as the quantum owed by the plaintiff to the defendant is not specified.

The learned Judge found that the setting aside application was governed by Art 34 and not Art 16(3) of the Model Law, as the March Award was not a preliminary ruling on jurisdiction (at [14]–[15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 In this case, there was no preliminary decision by the arbitrator on the issue of jurisdiction. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Additionally, Art 16 applies to a challenge to the jurisdiction of the tribunal at the commencement of the arbitral proceedings and not at or after the conclusion stage of the arbitral proceedings.

This applies when the arbitrator’s ruling on jurisdiction is included in the award.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Turning back to the present case, the defendant argues that the comment in <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang (HC</span><span class="font-italic">)</span> at [14] supports its argument that the phrase “preliminary question”, as used in s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA, refers only to positive jurisdictional rulings made at the early or initial stages of the arbitral proceedings. I disagree with the defendant that s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA can or should be interpreted in such a manner. First, the true <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> of <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang (HC)</span> on Mr Tang’s preliminary objection is, in my view, to be found at [15] where the learned Judge correctly held that the application was governed by Art 34 and not Art 16(3) of the Model Law, since the ruling on jurisdiction was included in the March Award which also dealt with the substantive merits of the arguments made at the further hearing. There was thus no ruling or decision as a preliminary question but rather an award that would only have been subject to a setting aside application under Art 34 of the Model Law. As I explain below at [38], this is in line with the decision of Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in the subsequent case of <span class="font-italic">AQZ v ARA</span> [2015] 2 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">AQZ</span>”). The <span class="font-italic">obiter </span><span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang (HC) </span>at [14] was accordingly immaterial to the learned Judge’s decision on Mr Tang’s preliminary objection. In any case and to the extent that my own conclusion on the ambit of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA may be inconsistent with this <span class="font-italic">obiter </span><span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang (HC)</span>, I respectfully decline to adopt the same as also being applicable to s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA. I also note that <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang (HC)</span> was subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tang Boon Jek Jeffrey v Tan Poh </span><span class="font-italic">Leng Stanley</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 273 (“<span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang (CA)</span>”) on the substantive merits of the setting aside application, although the Court of Appeal did not comment on the correctness of the <span class="font-italic">obiter dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang </span><span class="font-italic">(HC)</span> at [14].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I have come to the conclusion that s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA is <span class="font-italic">not</span> limited only to positive jurisdictional rulings or decisions made at the early or initial stages of an arbitration for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 First, based on the plain wording of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) alone, it is not at all apparent that a jurisdictional challenge <span class="font-italic">must</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>be raised at the early or initial stages of the arbitral proceedings. It is well established that the first step of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the possible interpretations of the statutory provision, having regard to the text of the provision: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 (<span class="font-italic">“Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [37]. In the present case, nowhere in s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is there any suggestion that a jurisdictional challenge must be raised by a certain point in time, or by a certain stage in the arbitral proceedings. The defendant’s proposed interpretation of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) appears to read a time limit into the provision that is not provided for. For this reason, I find that the defendant’s interpretation of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is not a possible<span class="font-italic"> </span>interpretation of the provision, and it therefore falls at the first step.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Second, even if there is any ambiguity as to what a “preliminary question” means, s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) must be read in the context of the other provisions of the AA. At the first step of statutory interpretation, regard must also be given to the context of the provision in question within the written law <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span>: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [37]. In this regard, I note that s 21(8) of the AA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(8) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea <span class="font-italic">referred to in this section </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, s 21(8) makes clear that the phrase “preliminary question” does <span class="font-italic">not</span> refer to a decision made at the early stages of the arbitration, as the defendant contends. Section 21(8) itself must be read in the context of the other provisions in s 21 of the AA. The relevant provisions are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Separability of arbitration clause and competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">21.</span>—(1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including a plea that it has no jurisdiction and any objections to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, <span class="font-italic">at any stage of the arbitral proceedings</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(7) Notwithstanding any delay in raising a plea referred to in subsection (4) or (6), the arbitral tribunal may admit such plea if it considers the delay to be justified in the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is clear from the above provisions that the overarching principle behind s 21 of the AA is that a tribunal may decide on a jurisdictional challenge <span class="font-italic">at any stage of the arbitration proceedings</span>. This much is made explicit by the plain wording of s 21(1). The defendant contends that s 21(4) of the AA suggests that relief under s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is only available for positive jurisdictional rulings made at the early stages of the arbitral proceedings, since s 21(4) provides that a plea that a tribunal has no jurisdiction “shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence”.

</div>
</div>
</div> A similar observation was made in <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang (HC) </span>at [14], in respect of Art 16(2) of the Model Law (<span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 21(4) of the AA) (see [27] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, in my view, it is clear from the design of s 21 of the AA that s 21(4) (and s 21(6), for that matter) are to be read subject to s 21(7) of the AA. While ss 21(4) and 21(6) impose <span class="font-italic">general </span>timelines for when objections to a tribunal’s jurisdiction should be raised, s 21(7) expressly provides that the tribunal nonetheless has discretion to admit a belated objection, if it considers the delay to be “justified in the circumstances”. Accordingly, it is clear to me that while parties are generally obliged to raise jurisdictional challenges in a timely manner under ss 21(4) and 21(6), the overall architecture of s 21 recognises the tribunal’s power and discretion to decide on a jurisdictional objection at <span class="font-italic">any </span>stage of the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my judgment, the wording of s 21(8) of the AA must therefore be considered against this backdrop. Section 21(8) provides that a tribunal may rule on a plea “<span class="font-italic">referred to in this section</span> either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits” [emphasis added]. Given my observation at [33] above that a jurisdictional objection referred to in s 21 may ultimately be decided on by the tribunal at any<span class="font-italic"> </span>stage of the proceedings, it would contradict the entire design of s 21 if s 21(8) were read to mean that a tribunal can only decide a jurisdictional challenge made <span class="font-italic">at the initial stages of </span><span class="font-italic">an arbitration</span>, or in an award that also deals with the merits. Accordingly, reading s 21(8) in context, it is evident that the phrase “preliminary question” cannot possibly refer only to a ruling made at the early or initial stages of the arbitration. It therefore follows that the phrase “preliminary question”, as used in s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA, likewise does <span class="font-italic">not </span>only refer to a ruling made at the initial stages of an arbitration. There is no reason why the phrase “preliminary question” should be interpreted differently across ss 21(8) and 21(9) of the AA, and Ms Sim has not suggested any.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Turning to the third reason for my conclusion, I find that the drafting history of ss 21(8) and 21(9) of the AA also makes clear that the phrase “preliminary question” does <span class="font-italic">not </span>refer to a ruling made at the initial stages of the arbitration proceedings. As I elaborate below, the phrase “preliminary question” instead refers to an <span class="font-italic">interim </span><span class="font-italic">decision </span>on the tribunal’s jurisdiction that is issued separately from<span class="font-italic"> </span>a decision on the merits of the parties’ claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The AA was enacted to align our domestic arbitration laws with our international arbitration laws and specifically, the Model Law: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(5 October 2001) vol 73 at col 2213 (Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Law). In this regard, ss 21(8) and 21(9) of the AA are modelled after Art 16(3) of the Model Law, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Article 16. Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph (2) of this article either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of that ruling, the court specified in article 6 to decide the matter, which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The genesis of Art 16(3) of the Model Law was considered in detail by Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">AQZ</span>. The issue in <span class="font-italic">AQZ</span> was whether a party was entitled to apply to the court under Art 16(3) of the Model Law for a decision on the tribunal’s jurisdiction, where the tribunal had issued an award that ruled on its jurisdiction as well as the merits of the arbitration. After considering the drafting history of Art 16(3) of the Model Law, Prakash J concluded that the proper recourse in such a situation was for the party to apply to set aside the award, rather than to seek relief under Art 16(3). In particular, the learned Judge observed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A review of the drafting history of the Model Law makes clear that the drafters did not intend an award that deals with the merits of the dispute (however marginally) to be subject to challenge under Art 16(3) of the Model Law.</span> Article 16(3) embodies the compromise the drafters eventually reached between two competing policy considerations concerning the issue of when courts should exercise control over the arbitral tribunal’s decision on its jurisdiction. On the one hand, allowing courts to rule on pleas as to the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction early would prevent undue waste of time and money in conducting an unnecessary arbitration. However, the availability of such a challenge could also be abused by a party for purposes of delay or obstruction and therefore it may be more desirable to defer court control until after the arbitral tribunal has issued its award (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in a proceeding to set aside an eventual award): see <span class="font-italic">Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the Work of its Eighteenth Session</span> (A/40/17, 3–21 June 1985) at paras 158–157.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68 The Commission, having considered the proposal of the Working Group, struck a compromise between the two competing policy considerations in the following manner. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It allowed the tribunal to choose between deciding the issue of its jurisdiction in a preliminary ruling which would be subject to instant court control or in a procedural decision which may be contested only in an action for setting aside the award.</span> Therefore, the tribunal was empowered to assess whether there was a greater risk of dilatory tactics or a possibility of time and costs being wasted by carrying out an unnecessary arbitration and decide whether it should make its decision on jurisdiction open to immediate court control. The learned authors of <span class="font-italic">A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration: Legislative History and Commentary</span> (Kluwer Law and Taxation, 1989), Howard M Holtzmann and Joseph E Neuhaus, describe the mode of court control that was finally adopted in the following terms (at p 486):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, under Article 8 a court may decide a jurisdictional objection in the course of deciding whether to refer a substantive claim before it to arbitration. During the pendency of this question before the court, the arbitral tribunal has discretion to continue the proceedings. Second, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">under Article 16, the arbitral tribunal has a choice whether to decide a jurisdictional question preliminarily or only in the final award.</span> If it issues a preliminary ruling, that is subject to immediate review by a court. Otherwise, review must wait for a setting aside proceeding. The advantage of this procedure is that the arbitral tribunal can assess in each case and with regard to each jurisdictional question whether the risk of dilatory tactics is greater than the danger of wasting money and time in a useless arbitration. The dangers of delay in the arbitration while the court is reviewing a preliminary ruling are further reduced by provision of short time period for seeking court review, finality in the court’s decision, and discretion in the arbitral tribunal to continue the proceedings while the court review is going on. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">These procedures … allow the tribunal to postpone decision of frivolous or dilatory objections, or ones that are difficult to separate from the merits of the case.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69 From the above, it should be apparent that relief under Art 16(3) is not available when a party seeks to set aside a ruling which is predominantly on jurisdiction but also marginally deals with the merits because that is simply not the purpose that the drafters intended Art 16(3) to serve. In such situations, the dissatisfied party can seek to set aside the award pursuant to s 3(1) of the [International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”)] read with the relevant limbs of Art 34(2) of the Model Law. That would be the obvious and more appropriate remedy. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The defendant also cites the above passages in support of its contention that the phrase “preliminary question” refers to a decision made at the early stages of the arbitration. In particular, the defendant relies on Prakash J’s observation at [65] in <span class="font-italic">AQZ </span>that there is a policy interest in “allowing courts to rule on pleas as to the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">early</span> [to] prevent undue waste of time and money in conducting an unnecessary arbitration” [emphasis added]. The defendant contends that Art 16(3) of the Model Law and s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA were therefore drafted to only permit recourse to courts in respect of positive jurisdictional rulings that are made as a preliminary question at the <span class="font-italic">early </span>stages of the arbitration proceedings.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In my judgment, the defendant’s argument misses the point of the observations in <span class="font-italic">AQZ</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>reproduced above at [38]. From the quoted passages, it is clear that while the drafters of Art 16(3) of the Model Law were keen to balance the interest in preventing unnecessary arbitrations on the one hand against the possibility of dilatory tactics on the other, the solution adopted was to allow the tribunal “a choice whether to decide a jurisdictional question preliminarily or only in the final award” (<span class="font-italic">AQZ </span>at [68]). In other words, if the tribunal’s concern is that time and costs may be wasted on an unnecessary arbitration, it can decide on its jurisdiction “preliminarily”, in an <span class="font-italic">interim </span><span class="font-italic">decision separate from the merits</span>, which would expose the tribunal’s decision to “instant court control” under Art 16(3) of the Model Law (<span class="font-italic">AQZ </span>at [68]). On the other hand, if the tribunal’s concern is that a party may use jurisdictional objections as a dilatory tactic, it can deal with questions of jurisdiction together with an award on the merits, which would only be subject to challenge at the setting aside stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Accordingly, it is clear that the phrase “preliminary question” was used by the drafters of Art 16(3) to refer to an interim decision or ruling that deals <span class="font-italic">solely</span> with the tribunal’s jurisdiction, in contradistinction to an award that deals with <span class="font-italic">both </span>the tribunal’s jurisdiction and the merits of the parties’ claims. Crucially for present purposes, there is no suggestion in the drafting history of Art 16(3) that the phrase “preliminary question” was meant to refer only to a decision or ruling made at the <span class="font-italic">early </span>stages of an arbitration. There is therefore no merit in the defendant’s submission. In my judgment, the term “preliminary question” in Art 16(3) of the Model Law, properly understood, refers simply to a decision or ruling made separate from and preliminary to any award on the merits, and <span class="font-italic">not </span>to a decision or ruling made at the preliminary (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>early) <span class="font-italic">stages</span> of the arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my view, the phrase “preliminary question”, as used in ss 21(8) and 21(9) of the AA, should similarly refer to an interim decision or ruling on the tribunal’s jurisdiction, which is separate to any award rendered on the substantive merits of the dispute. As I have noted at [37] above, ss 21(8) and 21(9) of the AA are modelled after Art 16(3) of the Model Law, and the defendant has not demonstrated why the phrase “preliminary question” should carry a different meaning in the AA than that in the Model Law or the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In addition, if the defendant’s suggested interpretation is correct, it would lead to the anomalous consequence that the 2021 Decision is completely immune to any challenge. If the 2021 Decision is not, as the defendant contends, a ruling as a preliminary question because it was not made at an early stage in the Arbitration, then it would not fall within s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA. On the other hand, since the 2021 Decision does not in any way deal with the substantive merits of the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, it is also not an award that would be subject to a setting aside application under s 48 of the AA. Such an outcome is intuitively wrong. It cannot be that Parliament intended for s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA to operate in a manner as to result in such an anomaly, and it is a trite principle of statutory interpretation that a court will strive to interpret a statutory provision in a way that avoids anomaly or absurdity (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [38]). The anomaly that results from accepting the defendant’s submission is a further compelling reason why its interpretation of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA cannot be the correct one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For completeness, I address two additional arguments raised by the defendant. First, the defendant relies on the difference in phrasing between ss 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the AA, to argue that the phrase “preliminary question” must refer to rulings made at an early stage of the arbitral proceedings. Section 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) permits recourse to the court for positive jurisdictional rulings made as a “preliminary question”, while s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) permits recourse for negative jurisdictional rulings made “at any stage of the arbitral proceedings”. The defendant contends that if a party were indeed permitted to seek recourse for positive jurisdictional rulings made “at any stage of the arbitral proceedings”, then s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) would be worded in a similar manner to s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a party could apply to court where there was a positive jurisdictional ruling made at “any stage of the arbitral proceedings”). According to the defendant, the fact that s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is not worded in such a fashion goes to show that recourse is only available in respect of positive jurisdictional rulings made at an early stage of the proceedings.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my view, this argument also misses the mark. As I have explained at [36]–[42] above, there is no suggestion in the legislative history of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that recourse under this provision should <span class="font-italic">only</span> be available in respect of positive jurisdictional rulings made at a certain stage of the proceedings. I therefore decline to read such a condition into s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Moreover, while s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the AA constitutes a departure from the Model Law (as the Model Law does not provide for recourse against negative jurisdictional rulings, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Art 16(3) at [37] above), there is no interpretative evidence to indicate that the introduction of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was meant to alter the meaning of the phrase “preliminary question”, to refer only to a ruling made at the early or initial stages of arbitration. Section 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was enacted in 2012, as it was thought that the absence of recourse against negative jurisdictional rulings may “defeat the parties’ intention to arbitrate”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(9 April 2012) vol 89 at p 65 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law). There is nothing in the relevant parliamentary debates, or in any of the materials placed before me, that supports the defendant’s contention that the difference in wording between ss 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was <span class="font-italic">designed </span><span class="font-italic">or intended</span> by Parliament to limit recourse under s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) only to rulings made at an early stage of the proceedings. I therefore do not think that the difference in wording between these two provisions is material for present purposes, and accordingly reject the defendant’s argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The second additional argument pertains to a string of cases cited by the defendant, where a challenge to a tribunal’s jurisdictional ruling was brought under s 10(3) of the IAA (<span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 21(9) of the AA). The cases cited by the defendant are: <span class="font-italic">CLQ v CLR</span> [2022] 3 SLR 145, <span class="font-italic">International Research Corp PLC v Lufthansa Systems Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 1 SLR 130, <span class="font-italic">Rakna</span><span class="font-italic"> Arakshaka Lanka Ltd v Avante Garde Maritime Services (Pte) Ltd</span> [2019] 2 SLR 131, and <span class="font-italic">BXY </span><span class="font-italic">and others v BXX and others</span> [2019] 4 SLR 413. Ms Sim highlights that in these cases, the challenges under s 10(3) of the IAA were brought at an early stage in the arbitral proceedings.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my view, these cases are of limited assistance to the defendant. At best, they illustrate that as a matter of practice, jurisdictional challenges do commonly tend to arise at an early stage in the arbitral proceedings. This may well be the case, since jurisdiction is ordinarily a natural precursor to the tribunal’s determination of the merits of the parties’ claims. However, the cases cited go no further than that. Crucially, none of the cases referred to by the defendant stands for the proposition that a jurisdictional challenge under s 10(3) of the IAA or s 21(9) of the AA <span class="font-italic">must </span><span class="font-italic">necessarily </span>be brought only at an early or initial stage of the arbitral proceedings or otherwise be barred. I therefore find these cases to be of limited assistance to the issue at hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In sum, I disagree with the defendant that s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA only permits a party to challenge a positive jurisdictional ruling made at an early stage of the arbitral proceedings. Properly understood, the phrase “preliminary question” simply means that a party is only entitled to seek relief under s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) if the jurisdictional ruling takes the form of an interim ruling or decision, which does not in any way touch on the substantive merits of the parties’ claims. In the present case, it is not disputed that the 2021 Decision deals <span class="font-italic">solely</span> with the question of the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction to issue the Further Award. Accordingly, I find that the 2021 Decision constitutes a ruling as a preliminary question within the meaning of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA, and that the plaintiff is therefore not barred from making the present application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As a final point on this issue, I would add that <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the defendant is correct in its interpretation of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA, I would be prepared to find that the 2021 Decision <span class="font-italic">is </span>a ruling made at the initial stages of an arbitral proceeding, and therefore, the plaintiff is in any event entitled to make the present application. The facts of this case can be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Tang (HC)</span>, where the setting aside application was brought <span class="font-italic">after</span> the parties had attended a further hearing on whether the January Award should be reversed, and the arbitrator had proceeded to issue the March Award, reversing the January Award in part (as noted above at [25]). In the present case, assuming for present purposes that the Arbitrator <span class="font-italic">does</span> have jurisdiction to issue the Further Award, the parties would conceivably have to go on to address the merits of the defendant’s claim in respect of the Nitrogen and Removal Claims by way of further submissions, and quite possibly attend another oral hearing before the Arbitrator. Accordingly, the 2021 Decision may be characterised as a ruling made at the initial stages of a <span class="font-italic">new </span><span class="font-italic">phase</span> of the Arbitration subsequent to the 2014 Award, such that it is subject to challenge under s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA. It is also plain that the plaintiff could not have raised its jurisdiction objection any earlier in the Arbitration. The question whether the Arbitrator has jurisdiction to issue the Further Award only arose when the defendant requested that the Arbitrator do so – that request was made by the defendant in August 2020 (see [13] above). In response, the plaintiff raised its jurisdiction challenge on 19 October 2020, before any other step was taken. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Therefore, even if I am wrong in my interpretation of s 21(9)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AA, the plaintiff is nonetheless not barred from bringing the present application. Having answered Issue 1 in the negative, I turn now to consider the substantive merits of the plaintiff’s application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Does the Arbitrator have jurisdiction to issue the Further Award?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As can be seen from the parties’ cases summarised at [18] and [20] above, the crux of the present dispute pertains to whether the 2014 Award was a partial award on the parties’ claims, or a final award. At the outset, I note that it is common ground between the parties that an award can be “final” in a number of ways. As explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK v CRW Joint Operation</span> [2015] 4 SLR 364 (“<span class="font-italic">Persero</span>”) at [51]–[53], an award can be “final” in the following ways:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, an award is “final” if it resolves a claim or a matter in an arbitration with preclusive effect (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the same claim or matter cannot be re-litigated).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, a “final” award can refer to an award that has achieved a sufficient degree of finality in the arbitral seat. In other words, the award is no longer susceptible to being appealed against or being subject to annulment proceedings in the arbitral seat.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, a “final” award can refer to the last award made in an arbitration which disposes of all remaining claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the present case, it is not in dispute that the 2014 Award is “final” in the first and second ways described above at [51].

</div> I will return to the case of <span class="font-italic">U&amp;M Mining </span>at [68] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The central question before me is whether the 2014 Award dealt with <span class="font-italic">all </span>the issues that were the subject of the Arbitration, such that the 2014 Award is final in the third sense described above at [51(c)]. In my view, the answer to this question is ultimately to be found by carefully interpreting the 2014 Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The principles applicable to interpreting an arbitral tribunal’s decision, albeit for the purposes of determining whether a tribunal’s decision constitutes an award or a procedural decision, were helpfully summarised in the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">ZCCM Investment Holdings Plc v Kansanshi Holdings Plc</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2019] EWHC 1285 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">ZCCM Investment</span>”).

Based on the extract from <span class="font-italic">Biffa Waste </span>quoted by the Arbitrator, the two options were to (a) adjourn the decision on quantum; or (b) make a conditional award. Crucially, the Arbitrator then chose the <span class="font-italic">second </span>option, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to make a conditional award – that much is clear from paragraph 238(h) of the Final Award (as reproduced at [57] above). In my view, this is also plainly evident from the fact that the Arbitrator prefaced the extract from <span class="font-italic">Biffa</span><span class="font-italic"> Waste </span>with a comment relating to the second option, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that “[c]ase law has recognised that the Court can make an award on quantum conditional upon the money being paid to a third party or that it is held on trust for that purpose”.

</div> Let me elaborate further.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the 2021 Decision, the Arbitrator considered an argument raised by the defendant that the Arbitrator’s statement in the 2014 Award that he “<span class="font-italic">will make</span> an order for the [plaintiff] to make payment to the [defendant] for [the Nitrogen Claim]” [emphasis added] could be interpreted as a reservation of jurisdiction to make further orders.

It is not in dispute that there was no express reservation of jurisdiction in the 2014 Award, or any similar statement expressed in “clear and categorical language”. There is also no satisfactory explanation for why this is the case, if the Arbitrator had indeed intended to reserve jurisdiction in the 2014 Award. For instance, while the Arbitrator ultimately concludes in the 2021 Decision that there was a reservation of jurisdiction in the 2014 Award, there is no discussion or explanation by the Arbitrator how this is the case, particularly when the Arbitrator also acknowledged in the <span class="font-italic">very</span><span class="font-italic"> same </span>decision that any reservation of jurisdiction would have been made by the Arbitrator clearly and categorically. In the circumstances, I am driven to find that the Arbitrator’s conclusion in the 2021 Decision (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that there was a reservation of jurisdiction in the 2014 Award) does not cohere with the objective evidence.

</div> While the defendant’s statement of the law <span class="font-italic">may</span> well be correct, I do not need to decide the point for the purposes of this application and therefore do not arrive at any definitive conclusion on it. For present purposes, neither party has pointed me to any authority that stands for or supports the proposition that an arbitrator can only reserve his jurisdiction through express words. Mr Ng for the plaintiff highlighted academic commentary that encourages arbitrators to make any reservation of jurisdiction in express terms. For instance, my attention was drawn to the following observations in Ray Turner, <span class="font-italic">Arbitration Awards – A Practical Approach </span>(Blackwell Publishing, 2005) at para 4.3.5:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.3.5 Reserved matters</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This relates to matters to be left over to be resolved by a subsequent award. Unless such reservation has been agreed between the parties, the arbitrator needs at some stage to decide what, if any, matters should be so reserved. There could be, for instance, remaining issues, interest, or costs; or less apparent matters such as the consequences of subsequent failure to comply with a performance award. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">He should specifically reserve those elements,</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>commonly by an item following the operative part of the award and prior to his signature. He should also maintain a further checklist so as to ensure that no reserved matters are subsequently overlooked.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted, emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the absence of any binding legal authority cited to me, I am prepared to assume (without deciding) the correctness of the defendant’s argument that as a matter of law, there is no legal<span class="font-italic"> </span>requirement that a reservation of jurisdiction by an arbitrator must be in express terms. Nonetheless, that argument does not assist the defendant much and in fact, misses the broader point in the present case. I have already noted above at [63] that it was acknowledged by the Arbitrator in the 2021 Decision that he would have made any reservation of jurisdiction in “clear and categorical language”. In light of this, <span class="font-italic">even if </span>the Arbitrator was not required to expressly reserve jurisdiction as a matter of law, the <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of any express reservation of jurisdiction goes to show that to the Arbitrator’s mind, there was <span class="font-italic">no</span> intention on the Arbitrator’s part to reserve any jurisdiction in the 2014 Award. This, in my judgment, is strong objective evidence that the Arbitrator <span class="font-italic">intended</span> for the 2014 Award to be final and dispositive of all remaining issues in the Arbitration. It therefore buttresses my conclusion that the Arbitrator was <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>once the 2014 Award was rendered.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 2014 Award fully resolved the disputes between the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Third, in addition to my conclusions at [61] and [66] above, I also find that the 2014 Award did, as a matter of fact, fully resolve all the disputes that formed the subject of the Arbitration. Accordingly, there is in my view no doubt that the 2014 Award is “final” in the third sense described in <span class="font-italic">Persero</span> (noted at [51] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As noted above at [52], both parties rely on the case of <span class="font-italic">U&amp;M Mining </span>for the general proposition that a conditional award can be dispositive of all of the issues in an arbitration. In <span class="font-italic">U&amp;M Mining</span>, the arbitral award ordered that the respondent in the arbitration (“KCM”) pay certain sums, “unless KCM shows cause, supported by evidence, within 14 days of the [award], why such an order should not be made” (the “Show Cause orders”) (at [83(ii)]). KCM sought, <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, a declaration by the English High Court that the Show Cause orders did not constitute a valid award (at [89]). KCM contended that a conditional award was not “a creature known to the law”, as a tribunal either had to make a provisional order, or “an outright award which left nothing in abeyance at all and was final and conclusive in every sense of the word on the date it was issued so it could immediately be enforced” (at [85]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Cooke J rejected the argument advanced by KCM, as follows (at [97]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I do not see why, as matter of principle … an award cannot be final and conclusive in its terms where it clearly provides for specific relief, including payments of money, which only bites at a point in the future</span>, in the absence of submission and evidence from an absent party to the contrary. The tribunal has made decisions which are final and complete and are not subject to further decisions on its part or of any other person or body unless a specified contingency occurs. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Such an award is complete and final on its own terms, albeit conditional.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whilst this might present difficulties for enforcement purposes, that is nothing to the point and does not prevent it from being an award which binds the parties.</span> So, here, those parts of the Second Award which contained the ‘show cause’ provisions were final, complete and conclusive, as between the parties, albeit conditional.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The above proposition of law is not disputed by either party. The defendant, however, seeks to distinguish the facts of <span class="font-italic">U&amp;M Mining </span>from the present case. In this regard, Ms Sim for the defendant argues that in <span class="font-italic">U&amp;M Mining</span>, once the 14-day period for KCM to show cause had expired, there was no further issue for the tribunal to decide.

</div> The purport of the Arbitrator’s orders in the 2014 Award was for the plaintiff to pay the defendant <span class="font-italic">whatever sum </span>the defendant ultimately in fact paid to RWS for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, up to a fixed maximum amount. This much is clear from the Arbitrator’s caution in the 2014 Award that “there is a risk of the [defendant] enjoying a windfall” if RWS did not end up making claims against the defendant for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, and that “[i]n the premises”, the Arbitrator would make a conditional order for the plaintiff to pay the defendant for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims.

</div> It is evident from the Arbitrator’s reasoning that his intent was to prevent the defendant from recovering <span class="font-italic">more </span>than what it actually paid to RWS for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims. The purpose of the conditional orders was therefore to ensure that the plaintiff paid the defendant the <span class="font-italic">same amount</span> that the defendant paid to RWS for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, up to a fixed maximum amount. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I therefore find that the Arbitrator <span class="font-italic">did </span>decide on the extent of the plaintiff’s liability. As noted in David St John Sutton, Judith Gill and Matthew Gearing, <span class="font-italic">Russell on Arbitration </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 24th Ed, 2015) at para 6-092, an award is sufficiently certain if it “sets out the method of calculation of the amount due to be paid”. In my judgment, while the 2014 Award admittedly does not contain a <span class="font-italic">specific sum </span>to be paid by the plaintiff for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, the 2014 Award nevertheless sets out the <span class="font-italic">method </span>by which this precise sum is to be derived (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whatever amount the defendant pays to RWS, up to a maximum amount). The 2014 Award therefore “clearly provides for specific relief”, such that it is “complete and final on its own terms” (<span class="font-italic">per U&amp;M Mining </span>at [97]). In the circumstances, I reject the defendant’s argument that the 2014 Award left the extent of the plaintiff’s liability unresolved, with a resultant implicit reservation of the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction in the 2014 Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 On a related point and for the avoidance of doubt, I do not agree with the plaintiff’s characterisation of the 2014 Award as being “self-executing” (see [18(b)] above). In my view, the term “self-executing” distracts from the core issue in contention, which is whether the Arbitrator reserved his jurisdiction in the 2014 Award, and thus retains jurisdiction to issue the Further Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Moreover, the 2014 Award is <span class="font-italic">not</span> immune to difficulties in enforcement. As the facts of the present case illustrate, the 2014 Award does not state what evidence (if any) the defendant must provide before the plaintiff’s liability to pay the defendant for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims crystallises, nor does it provide for how any disputes arising out of the Arbitrator’s conditional orders should be resolved. As the defendant points out, it is well established that the court’s approach toward the enforcement of arbitral awards is “a mechanistic one which does not require judicial investigation by the court of the jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought”: <span class="font-italic">Aloe Vera of America, Inc v Asianic Food (S) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 174 at [42].

</div>
</div> Accordingly, questions arise as to whether (a) the Arbitrator’s conditional orders in the 2014 Award can be enforced, when there are pending disputes as to whether the plaintiff has been furnished with sufficient evidence of the defendant’s payment to RWS for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims; and (b) if not, whether it is appropriate for such disputes to be resolved by a court hearing an application to enforce the 2014 Award. In my view, these are matters that remain to be determined by a court hearing an application to enforce the 2014 Award, should the defendant choose to make such an application in future and I say nothing further about them. For present purposes, I do not agree that the 2014 Award can fairly be characterised as “self-executing”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In any case, whether or not the 2014 Award is “self-executing” is ultimately ancillary to my decision – nothing turns on this. While there may be potential difficulties in enforcing the 2014 Award as highlighted above at [75], it does not inexorably follow that the Arbitrator made a reservation of jurisdiction in the 2014 Award. As was observed in <span class="font-italic">U&amp;M Mining</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [97], a conditional award may “present difficulties for enforcement purposes” but that does not prevent the award from being complete, final and binding on the parties. To conclude otherwise would place the cart before the horse. It is the omission of the Arbitrator to make an express reservation of jurisdiction in the 2014 Award, or more specifically his choice to make a conditional award, that has, at least partly, caused the potential enforcement difficulties discussed above at [75], and not the other way around. The fact that there may be enforcement difficulties with the 2014 Award cannot be an independent reason to reverse engineer and read a reservation of jurisdiction into the 2014 Award, and more so when weighed against the other objective evidence as detailed above at [56]–[73].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 2014 Award has the attributes of a final award</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I turn to the fourth and final reason for my conclusion that the 2014 Award did not reserve any jurisdiction to the Arbitrator to issue a further award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 As noted in <span class="font-italic">ZCCM Investments </span>(at [54] above), in determining the nature of a tribunal’s decision, it is relevant to consider how a “reasonable recipient” would view the decision, after considering the objective attributes of the decision. In this regard, I find that there are two attributes of the 2014 Award that bolster the conclusion that it is the <span class="font-italic">last </span>award and dispositive of all the issues in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 First, the 2014 Award is titled “Final Award”. While this alone is not determinative of the nature of the award, I find that a reasonable recipient of the 2014 Award would take the title to mean that it was the last award in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Second, I note that the 2014 Award contains a final order on costs.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I do not find it necessary to reach any definitive conclusion on this point for the purposes of deciding the issue at hand. Nor do I venture so far as to conclude that the last award in an arbitration <span class="font-italic">must </span>invariably include an award on costs. However, for the purposes of the application before me, I agree with the plaintiff that a final costs order would at least be reasonably common in the last award in an arbitration. As noted in Nigel Blackaby <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration </span>(Oxford University Press, 6th Ed, 2015) at para 9-18:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All awards are final and binding, subject to any available challenges. However, the term ‘final award’ is customarily reserved for an award that completes the mission of the arbitral tribunal. Subject to certain exceptions, the delivery of a final award renders the arbitral tribunal <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>: it ceases to have any further jurisdiction in respect of the dispute, and the special relationship that exists between the arbitral tribunal and the parties during the currency of the arbitration ends. This has significant consequences. An arbitral tribunal should not issue a final award until it is satisfied that its mission has actually been completed. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If there are outstanding matters to be determined, such as questions relating to costs (including the arbitral tribunal’s own costs), the arbitral tribunal should issue an award expressly designated as a partial</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">award</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In other words, it is customarily the case that costs, including the arbitrator’s own costs, are the <span class="font-italic">last </span>issue to be dealt with by the tribunal in the arbitral proceedings. Thus, coming back to the question of how a reasonable recipient would view the 2014 Award (see [78] above), I find that from a reasonable recipient’s perspective, the inclusion of a final costs order in the 2014 Award is yet another <span class="font-italic">indic</span><span class="font-italic">ium</span> that the 2014 Award was the <span class="font-italic">last </span>award in the Arbitration and dispositive of all issues therein. In my judgment, the 2014 Award is therefore final in all three senses described in <span class="font-italic">Persero </span>(noted above at [51]). As a consequence, the Arbitrator is <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>and lacks jurisdiction to issue any further award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In light of my conclusion that the Arbitrator did not reserve any jurisdiction in the 2014 Award, whether expressly or implicitly, it is not strictly necessary for me to deal with the plaintiff’s remaining argument that the parties, in their post-award correspondence, treated the 2014 Award as the last award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does the defendant have no further recourse in respect of the Nitrogen and Removal Claims?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I now turn to the defendant’s final argument.

</div>
</div> As noted at [21] above, the defendant argues that it may not be able to commence a fresh arbitration against the plaintiff in relation to the Nitrogen and Removal Claims. Further, the defendant cannot request for an additional award under s 43(4) of the AA, as the 30-day timeline to do so has long passed. I have also noted at [75] above that there are unresolved questions as to whether the Arbitrator’s conditional orders in the 2014 Award can be enforced without difficulty, which are ultimately questions best answered by a court hearing an application to enforce the 2014 Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In my judgment, and for reasons similar to those stated at [76] above, the fact that the defendant may have no further recourse in respect of the Nitrogen and Removal Claims cannot <span class="font-italic">itself</span> be a basis for finding that the Arbitrator retains jurisdiction to issue the Further Award. The central question in this case is whether the Arbitrator reserved jurisdiction to issue a further award – that inquiry begins and ends with an examination of the 2014 Award. As I have found above at [84], the Arbitrator made no such reservation of jurisdiction. That really is the end of the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Further, even if the defendant is ultimately left with no further recourse in respect of the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, I find some force in Mr Ng’s submission that this is in part a result of the defendant’s own doing. For one, the defendant did not seek an additional award from the Arbitrator within the timeline provided for in s 43(4) of the AA (for example, on the evidence needed to prove that the defendant had made payment to RWS for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, in order for the plaintiff’s liability to crystallise). Likewise, while there is case law and commentary to suggest that an arbitral award may be set aside if the exact sum to be paid is unclear (see <span class="font-italic">Official Assignee v Chartered Industries of Singapore Ltd </span>[1977–1978] SLR(R) 435, noted in <span class="font-italic">Arbitration in Singapore: A Practical Guide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sundaresh Menon CJ gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2018) at para 13.092), no such setting aside application was brought by the defendant. The defendant’s application in HC/OS 1107/2014 was one seeking to set aside a <span class="font-italic">different</span> part of the 2014 Award, unrelated<span class="font-italic"> </span>to the Arbitrator’s orders on the Nitrogen and Removal Claims.

</div> Finally, the defendant has not, in any event, sought to enforce the 2014 Award against the plaintiff, despite nearly eight years elapsing since the issuance of the 2014 Award. No explanation has been offered by the defendant for this lapse in time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 For the foregoing reasons, I do not place weight on the defendant’s argument that it will be left without recourse for the Nitrogen and Removal Claims, in the event it is found (as I have) that the Arbitrator does not possess jurisdiction to issue the Further Award. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I find that the 2014 Award was final and dispositive of all the issues in the Arbitration, such that the Arbitrator became <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> once the 2014 Award was issued.
