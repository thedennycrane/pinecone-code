<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the defendants against the
                    decision of the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) to dismiss their
                    application to strike out the plaintiffs’ statement of claim under
                    O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“ROC”) and/or under the inherent powers of the Court. The
                    defendants have also appealed against the AR’s dismissal of their
                    application for a stay of proceedings on the ground of <em>forum
                        non conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This action concerns assets forming part of the
                    estate of Obeidillah bin Salim bin Talib (“the Deceased”), a
                    Muslim, who died intestate on 5 May 2005. At the time of his death, the
                    Deceased had various assets in Singapore and Malaysia. He also had one asset in
                    Egypt, namely, a 16.972% share in an Egyptian “civil property
                    company”, Al Taleb Al Akaria (“Al Taleb”). It was
                    not established whether this was a company or a partnership under Egyptian law.
                    Al Taleb was established in Cairo by the Deceased together with some
                    members of his family. Its only asset is a building in Cairo, and its only
                    income is the rental income from the same building.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiffs are the Singapore administrators
                    of the Deceased’s estate under a grant of letters of administration by the
                    Singapore court (the Singapore Grant”).The defendants, being sons of one
                    of the brothers of the Deceased, are all among the beneficiaries under Islamic
                    law of the Deceased’s estate named in the Inheritance Certificate issued
                    by the Singapore Syariah Court on 12 May 2005. The defendants are also the
                    former directors/managers of Al Taleb. They were appointed in 1986 and were
                    removed as directors/managers on 31 October 2007 pursuant to an order of
                    the South Cairo Court of First Instance (“the Cairo Court Order”).
                    The first plaintiff is a derivative beneficiary of the Deceased’s estate,
                    and the second plaintiff is not a beneficiary but an attorney for a
                    beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Cairo Court Order was based on a finding
                    that an amendment to Al Taleb’s governing contract which permitted
                    four directors/managers to be appointed instead of two was invalid. As a result
                    of the Cairo Court Order, Al Taleb has been placed under a temporary
                    receivership and the Cairo court has appointed a receiver (“the
                    Receiver”). At present, the Receiver continues to perform his duties as
                    receiver of Al Taleb.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiffs’ case in their statement of
                    claim is that they, as Singapore administrators of the Deceased’s estate,
                    are entitled under Singapore law and Egyptian law to represent the estate to
                    recover from the defendants, who are former directors/managers of Al Taleb,
                    now replaced by the Receivers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The reliefs sought by the plaintiffs are as
                    follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an order that the defendants account for all
                            monies due from Al Taleb to the Deceased and to pay over all such monies
                            including the sum of Egyptian Pounds 133,891.190 (being the monies due
                            to the Deceased as at 31 December 2005) to the plaintiffs
                            forthwith;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the defendants do pay interest on the monies
                            paid to the Deceased’s estate at such rate as the Court thinks
                            fit;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the defendants do within seven days of the

                                    2007;</div>

                                    payments by Al Taleb to the Deceased for his 16.972% share in
                                    Al Taleb, during the Deceased’s lifetime from the
                                    date of the appointment of the defendants as managers/directors
                                    of Al Taleb in end-1986 to May 2005;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the defendants do pay the costs of this
                            action and the costs of and incidental to the plaintiffs’
                            applications in Originating Summons No 1406 of 2008/P;

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the plaintiffs shall be entitled to withhold

                            terms of the order to be made herein.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendants then applied to strike out and
                    stay the action in the following applications:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The first summons, Summons No 2386 of

                            plaintiffs’ claim under O 18 r 19(1) of the ROC and/or
                            by the inherent powers of the court.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The second summons, Summons No 2400 of
                            2010/Y, is the defendants’ alternative application to stay Suit
                            No 261 of 2010/G (converted from Originating Summons
                            No 1406/2008/P) on the ground of <em>forum non
                                conveniens</em>.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Both summonses were heard by the AR who
                    dismissed the striking out application on 4 March 2011, which was based on
                    the defendants’ argument that the plaintiffs were coming to court to seek
                    remedies which they knew that under Egyptian law only the receiver is entitled
                    to and that for them to do so would compel the defendants to commit a breach of
                    Egyptian law. Further the AR declined to strike out the statement of claim as
                    she thought it would amount to conducting a preliminary trial based on
                    affidavits without allowing the plaintiffs’ position to be explained at
                    trial. The AR also dismissed the stay application. Although she considered the
                    “current political state in Egypt and the enforceability of any decision
                    in Cairo as a neutral factor”, she concluded that due to the
                    “change in circumstances in Cairo (political and otherwise), justice
                    requires the action to be nonetheless heard in Singapore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Striking Out Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It is settled that the failure to establish
                    title to commence legal action provides sufficient grounds for striking out (see
                        <em>Alliance Entertainment Singapore Pte Ltd v Sim Kay Teck
                        and Another</em>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 869).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lex fori governs locus standii</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Whether the plaintiffs, as administrators of
                    the Deceased’s Al Taleb shares, are entitled to commence legal action in
                    Singapore is a matter that is to be determined under Singapore law, which is the
                        <em>lex fori</em>, as is explained by <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) (“<em>Dicey, Morris and Collins</em>”) at
                    paras 7-011–7-012:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Parties. In determining who are the proper parties to proceedings, the
                        first question is whether the claimant or defendant is the sort of person or
                        body that can be made a party to litigation. This is a question for the
                            <em>lex fori</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Assuming that a claimant is capable of suing in the above sense, the next
                        question is whether he is the proper claimant in the particular action
                        before the court. Clearly, he is not if by the <em>lex
                            causae</em> the right which he is seeking to enforce did not vest
                        in him but in someone else. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Singapore Grant does not extend to non-Singapore assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The question then is whether, as a matter of
                    Singapore law, the plaintiffs as administrators under the Singapore Grant have
                    the right, title and interest in the Deceased’s Al Taleb shares to
                    commence such legal action with respect of these shares. As a general rule,
                    title to foreign assets does not vest in a Singapore personal representative by
                    necessary implication from the Singapore grant of letters of representation.
                    According to <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins</em> at
                    para 26-022:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All property of the deceased, whether it consists of movables or
                        immovables (apart from the special case of settled land) which at the time
                        of his death is locally situate in England, vests in the English personal
                        representative. It is not necessary that he should have reduced the property
                        into possession. On the other hand, <em>assets outside
                            England do not vest in an English personal representative by virtue of
                            his grant. Whether or not he is entitled to recover them is a matter for
                            the law of the country in which they are situate</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I next proceed to examine the express text of
                    the Singapore Grant. The Singapore Grant obtained by the plaintiffs reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">BE IT KNOWN that at the date hereunder-written Letters of Administration
                        of <em>all and singular the movable and immovable property

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Schedule is an integral part of the
                    Singapore Grant. That it goes beyond the purposes of determining and securing
                    the payment of estate duty is clear from its terms. It further sets out the
                    value of the assets and estate duty payable in respect to these assets which are
                    specifically described. Section 41 of the Estate Duty Act (Cap 96,
                    2005 Rev Ed) is clear in that it requires the certificate to set out all
                    property of the deceased, whether estate duty is leviable on such property or
                    not. It further provides that property discovered after the grant of letters of
                    representation may be included by way of a supplemental schedule. It is clear
                    from this that the function of the schedule is not confined to property on which
                    estate duty is payable. That being the case, the inscription of “Property
                    in respect of which the Grant is not made” has a purpose beyond the
                    collection of estate duty. By its terms, it establishes that title to such
                    property, as is described, does not pass by virtue of the Singapore
                    Grant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It is noteworthy that although estate duty has
                    been abolished in Singapore, applications for grant of probate or letters of
                    administration still require a schedule of assets to be prepared (see
                        para 129(2)(<em>c</em>) of the <em>Supreme Court Practice Directions</em>). This is consistent with the
                    position that the grant confers title on the executor or administrator with
                    respect to the assets to the extent set out in the grant. Thus where the
                    schedule describes assets with the qualification that “Property in
                    respect of which the Grant is not made”, title to such assets cannot be
                    said to arise from such a grant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is thus clear that as a matter of the
                        <em>lex fori</em> the plaintiffs, as administrators of
                    the Deceased’s estate, do not have any right, title or interest in respect
                    of the Deceased’s Al Taleb shares either by implication or by the
                    express text of the Singapore Grant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the light of the above I would strike out
                    the plaintiffs’ statement of claim as they do not have <em>locus standi</em> under Singapore law, without prejudice to anyone
                    having title to the Deceased’s Al Taleb shares to commence fresh
                    proceedings in the Singapore courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Application to Stay the Proceedings on the ground of Forum Non
                Conveniens</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I proceed to consider the defendants’
                    alternative application that the proceedings be stayed on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Law on forum non conveniens</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The law on <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> as set out in <em>Spiliada Maritime
                        Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”) has been concisely restated in the
                    following manner by the Court of Appeal in C<em>IMB Bank Bhd v
                        Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at
                    [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The gist of these principles is that, under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, <em>a stay will
                            only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some other
                            available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the
                            action</em>. The burden of establishing this rests on the
                        defendant and it is not enough just to show that Singapore is not the
                        natural or appropriate forum. The defendant must also establish that there
                        is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate
                        than Singapore. <em>The natural forum is one with which the
                            action has the most real and substantial connection</em>. In this
                        regard, the factors which the court will take into consideration include not
                        only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as the availability of
                        witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction
                        and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business.
                        If the court concludes, at this stage of the inquiry ("stage one of the
                            <em>Spiliada</em> test"), that there is no other
                        available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the
                        action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. <em>If, at this
                            stage, it concludes that there is some other available forum which prima
                            facie is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will
                            ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of
                            which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be
                            refused</em>. In this connection, the court will consider all the
                        circumstances of the case. For this second stage inquiry ("stage two of the
                            <em>Spiliada</em> test"), the legal burden is on
                        the plaintiff to establish the existence of those special
                        circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Stage One: The Connecting Factors Point to Egypt as the More
                Appropriate Forum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The courts of Egypt are clearly the more
                    appropriate forum for hearing the dispute for, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, this action concerns shares
                        in an Egyptian entity whose legal status and the incidents therefrom are
                        determined by Egyptian law. The plaintiffs concede that the <em>lex causae</em> is Egyptian law, and it is well
                        established that the applicable law to the dispute is a relevant and
                        significant connecting factor (see <em>Rickshaw Investments
                            Ltd v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</em> [2007]
                        1 SLR(R) 377). It is also clear that “the governing law
                        factor becomes a more weighty one if it would involve courts having to apply
                        unfamiliar systems of law” (see <em>Halsbury’s
                            Laws of Singapor</em>e – Conflict of Laws vol 6(2)
                        (LexisNexis, 2009) (“<em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                            Singapore</em>”) at para 75.093). Egypt is a civil law
                        jurisdiction and its laws and procedures are significantly different from
                        those in Singapore. The applicable law is “obviously a more weighty
                        factor in a dispute which turns on questions of interpretation of the law
                        than one which merely involves the application of the law” (see
                            <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> at
                        para 75.093).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the Egyptian court has appointed a Receiver over
                        Al Taleb. The incidents of the power of the Receiver with respect to
                        the assets, books and records of Al Taleb and claims related thereto
                        are matters of Egyptian law. The fourth defendant, who is averred to be in
                        possession of the relevant documents, resides in Egypt. The building from
                        which Al Taleb derives its main income in the form of rent and its
                        books, records and receipts and compliance with applicable law is determined
                        by Egyptian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, there are three pending cases before the Egyptian courts
                        involving the plaintiffs, the defendants and the Receiver relating to the
                        affairs of Al Taleb. The shareholders of Al Taleb, present
                        plaintiffs and defendants included, have a history of seeking relief from
                        the Egyptian courts, from the time of the entity’s registration. The
                        continuation of this action in Singapore accordingly carries the risk of
                        outcomes in contradiction of Egyptian law and the rights and duties of the
                        Egyptian court appointed Receiver.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Egyptian courts are, in the light of the
                    above, the more appropriate forum for the resolution of this dispute between the
                    parties. This is not overridden by reason only that three of the defendants
                    reside in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Stage Two: There is No Personal or Juridical Disadvantage to the
                Plaintiffs in Granting a Stay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The first stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test being clearly satisfied, I move on to consider the
                    second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, which was
                    succinctly restated by the Court of Appeal in <em>PT Hutan Domas
                        Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd and anothe</em>r [2001]
                    1 SLR(R) 104 at [16]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… If the court concludes that there is such a more appropriate
                        forum, it will ordinarily grant a stay unless, in the words of Lord Goff,
                        "there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay
                        should nevertheless not be granted. In this inquiry the court will consider
                        all the circumstances of the case, including circumstances which go beyond
                        those taken into account when considering connecting factors with other
                        jurisdictions” … One such factor which would warrant a refusal
                        of stay would be if it can be established by <em>objective
                            cogent evidence</em> that the plaintiff will not obtain justice in
                        the foreign jurisdiction. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal also noted that the plaintiff bears the burden of
                    establishing that he will be denied substantial justice if the case is not heard
                    in the forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The plaintiffs argue that commencing the
                    action in Egypt would cause a delay which would allow the defendants to delay
                    the release of monies and documents. In <em>Oriental Insurance Co
                        Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 363, the
                    Court of Appeal ruled that a bare assertion of likely delay would not suffice,
                    and even if the argument was accepted, a delay would not ordinarily merit a stay
                    of proceedings if all that could be shown was inconvenience and not substantial
                    injustice (at [44]–[45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The respondents also said they might have to put up security for costs,
                        and that a speedier resolution could be had in Singapore. However, no
                        evidence was raised to suggest the likely delay (if any). In the absence of
                        such evidence, we were unable to give credence to the respondents'
                        assertion. Furthermore, even if we were to accept that there would be
                        substantial delay if proceedings were stayed, this consideration, though
                        valid, was not so weighty as to merit a stay of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ultimately, any delay which might be occasioned by a stay, in our view,
                        would not represent a substantial injustice to the respondents. The overall
                        effect would be to cause them inconvenience. However, this was not a case,
                        to borrow a phrase from the judgment of Lord Brandon of Oakbrook
                            in <em>The Abidin Daver</em> [1984] 1 All
                        ER 470, in which there was an overwhelming balance of convenience in favour
                        of the respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the plaintiffs remain at liberty to file their
                    requests with the Receiver for accounts and payments relating to the
                    Deceased’s Al Taleb shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiffs next claim that Singapore is
                    the only forum that can issue effective orders to compel the defendants to
                    deliver the documents and assets. This submission ignores the reality that the
                    defendants being concurrently beneficiaries of the Deceased’s estate
                    including the Al Taleb shares, would have sufficient personal interest to comply
                    with lawful orders of the Receiver. In any event this would be one factor to
                    consider but no means is it conclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In dismissing the defendants’
                    application on 4 March 2011 to stay the proceedings on the basis of
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the AR took into account
                    the “current political state” of Egypt and opined that justice
                    requires the action be heard in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Here, the relevant issue is whether the
                    political situation in Egypt is such that the plaintiffs would be denied
                    substantial justice if they were to commence proceedings there or refer their
                    claims to the Cairo court-appointed Receiver.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The political uncertainty in the spring of
                    2011 in Egypt does not appear to have resulted in the cessation of functioning
                    of the Egyptian judicial institutions. The defendants’ counsel advised the
                    court and the plaintiffs’ counsel did not deny that the Cairo court
                    decided on 9 March 2011 to uphold the decision of the lower court to annul
                    the defendants’ appointment as directors/managers of Al Taleb. In any
                    case, for purposes of taking judicial notice, where is any doubt as to the
                    proper functioning of Egyptian judicial institutions, that doubt should be
                    resolved against the plaintiffs who so assert (see <em>Zheng Yu
                        Shan v Lian Beng Construction (1988) Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    2 SLR(R) 587 at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the light of the above relevant to the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> stage two test, I do not find that it
                    has been established that the plaintiffs would be denied substantial justice to
                    pursue their action before the Egyptian courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I would, quite apart from granting the
                    striking out application, in any event, have granted a stay on the ground of
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For all these reasons, the appeal is allowed.
                    The defendants will have costs here and below.</p>
