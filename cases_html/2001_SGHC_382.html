<strong>Judgment</strong>

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<u xmlns=""><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font>THE BACKGROUND</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1 The Plaintiff company was a Grade G8 construction company in

Singapore before it was ordered to be wound up on 26 May 2000 on the ground of insolvency.

It was unable to pay debts amounting to $53.3 million. This action was commenced by its

liquidator, Yin Kum Choy, on 7 October 2000, followed by a Mareva injunction shortly

thereafter. The Directors were either former directors and/or shareholders, affiliated

companies or relatives of the key person in these proceedings, Tong Tien See (the First

Defendant). The claims against the Defendants were under various heads – breach of

duties as directors, conspiracy to injure by unlawful means, breach of trust, knowing

assistance in the breaches and conspiracy and/or knowing receipt of money resulting from

such breaches and conspiracy – in aggregate amounting to $53.3 million. The Plaintiff

company also claimed a declaration that the property known as 755 Upper East Coast Road

was disposed by the Second and the Third Defendants to the Thirteenth Defendant (husband

of the Third Defendant) in breach of Section 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property

Act and sought a rescission of the sale and purchase agreement in respect of that

property.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 When the trial commenced, the First and Third Defendants had been

adjudicated bankrupt (on 23 February 2001) and the action against them was stayed

automatically under Section 76(1)(c)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Act. Towards the conclusion of

the trial, upon the Plaintiff company’s application, the action against both of them

was ordered to proceed. The First Defendant had been a key witness at the trial and was

present practically throughout the proceedings. The Third Defendant had filed her

affidavit of evidence-in-chief and the indications were that she was going to testify at

the trial. However, in the course of the trial, it emerged that she was not going to

return from Australia to testify here and her affidavit of evidence-in-chief was therefore

not admitted in evidence. It was clear that the Third Defendant was in constant contact

with the First Defendant and/or the Second Defendant (her parents) throughout the trial.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 The relationship of the various Tong family Defendants can be

described quickly by reference to the following diagram annexed to the Amended Statement

of Claim:</p>

</center></div>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The Sixth and Seventh Defendants were Singapore companies affiliated

to the Plaintiff company. The Eighth Defendant, an Australian company, was also affiliated

to the Plaintiff company. In late 1999/early 2000, the First, Second and Third Defendants

left to settle in Australia after making arrangements to sell away their residential

properties and their cars and to ship their belongings to their new home. They were joined

by the Tenth Defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 On 2 March 2000, the Plaintiff company was placed under interim

Judicial Management. On 25 April 2000, Yin Kum Choy was appointed its Provisional

Liquidator. He was confirmed as the Liquidator on 26 May 2000 upon the winding up order

being made. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 The Liquidator’s first Interim Report dated 6 October 2000

showed that the Plaintiff company had been insolvent since financial year 1 May 1995 to 30

April 1996. However, the directors and shareholders held the Plaintiff company out as a

solvent G8 (the highest grading) construction company at the material times, thereby

allowing the Plaintiff company to carry on business, take on new projects and sink further

into debt. Accounting entries were falsified using the Sixth Defendant, an affiliated

company, as one of the instruments of falsification. Losses were transferred from the

Plaintiff company to the Sixth Defendant by the raising of sham bills in respect of

Accounts Payable and Project/Administration Overheads. Bills were in turn raised by the

Sixth Defendant (purportedly the Plaintiff company’s subcontractor and whose sole

client was the Plaintiff company) to the Plaintiff company, thereby allowing large amounts

of money to be transferred periodically from the Plaintiff company to the Sixth Defendant

between 1 May 1995 and 30 April 2000. Accounting information was also misleading in that

the Plaintiff company deliberately deferred recognizing its losses of $3.4 million in

financial year ending 30 April 1995 so as not to fall below the minimum requirement of $5

million net capital worth, a criterion of the Building and Construction Authority for G8

grading. The grading was reviewed every three years.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The Sixth Defendant was totally dependent on the Plaintiff company

for financial support and had no infrastructure or manpower of its own. It was also

insolvent. All indebtedness of the Sixth and Seventh Defendants to the Plaintiff company

was on no fixed repayment terms, was interest-free and unsecured.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 The Plaintiff company and its affiliates were treated by the First

and Second Defendants as their and the family’s personal assets. The Plaintiff

company’s money was used by them for purchasing and building residential properties

registered in personal names. Such money was also used by them to earn interest for

themselves in interest-bearing deposits. In the words of Mr B M Singh in an email, they

"used the company as a ATM".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 It was conceded that the Plaintiff company’s losses were

transferred to the Sixth Defendant through the raising of some $25 million worth of bills

to the Sixth Defendant. It was also conceded that the transactions between the two

companies leading to the Sixth Defendant billing the Plaintiff company were not arm’s

length transactions but it was denied that those transactions and billings were sham ones.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

THE DEFENDANTS</p>
<p align="justify">(1) The First Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 The First Defendant, 71 years of age, the patriarch of the Tong

family, used to reside at 2 Kew Drive. He left for Australia in early 2000 and returned

here for the trial. He came from China around 1948. In 1957, he married the Second

Defendant. The Ninth Defendant was born in 1958, the Third Defendant in 1964 and the twin

sisters (the Tenth and the Eleventh Defendants) in 1968. He worked hard and in 1973,

registered a construction firm, employing the Fifth Defendant soon thereafter as the sole

employee. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 He had basic education in Chinese and was practically illiterate in

English. He said he had no idea about accounts. He was a hot-tempered, traditional Chinese

businessman who ruled his family with a strong arm. All properties bought or registered in

the names of the family members were regarded by the First Defendant as belonging to

himself. He appointed and removed directors of his companies as he pleased and changed the

shareholdings of his daughters depending on whether he was pleased or angry with any of

them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 As his construction business grew and flourished, the firm was

incorporated as a private limited company in 1985 with the First Defendant as Managing

Director and majority shareholder. The company had many public sector construction

projects. The Fourth Defendant (his brother-in-law) joined his business in 1984 as a

foreman and, after a short period of absence, rejoined it in 1987. In 1992, the Fourth

Defendant was made a director of the Plaintiff company. He became the Deputy Managing

Director in 1995/1996 as the Tong family wanted to "give him face".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 The First Defendant bought properties and a plot of land formerly

known as 4 Kew Drive on which he constructed four houses – 4 and 4A Kew Drive and 755

and 757 Upper East Coast Road. He also bought holiday homes in Perth and in Sydney and

developed a penchant for golf and fine wine, which he kept in a wine cellar in his former

home at 2 Kew Drive and in 755 Upper East Coast Road (the home of the Third Defendant and

her husband, the Thirteenth Defendant). The Plaintiff company held annual golf

tournaments. The First Defendant also commissioned and affixed wine labels bearing the

Plaintiff company’s name on bottles of wine as gifts for his business associates.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 He claimed that he was in semi-retirement since 1995 and had left

the running of the company to the Fourth Defendant. However, the evidence showed quite

clearly that he was still the final decision-maker in all things pertaining to the

companies – from tenders to negotiations with subcontractors and award of

subcontracts. He was also actively monitoring the progress at the various worksites,

travelling about in a vehicle driven by his wife.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(2) The Second Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 The Second Defendant, 61 years of age, was an intelligent, astute

and capable wife, mother and businesswoman. She received formal education in Chinese up to

Secondary 4 level, quite a rarity in the days of old for a girl. She controlled the

companies’ finances, invested in shares and in foreign currencies. She was trusted

completely by the First Defendant and was practically her husband’s alter ego save

for his hot temper. Only she and the First Defendant were authorized to be sole

signatories in respect of the bank accounts. Although she was the Managing Director in the

Sixth Defendant only, the Second Defendant received monthly remuneration from both the

Plaintiff company and the Sixth Defendant. She transferred progress payments from the HDB

in respect of the construction projects to personal accounts to earn interest instead of

depositing the large amounts into the Plaintiff company’s account which, she said,

earned no interest. She transferred the principal amounts back to the Plaintiff company

subsequently, retained the interest and paid income tax on the same. Over the years, the

principal amounts involved added up cumulatively to $194 million.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 The Second Defendant, together with the Third, Fourth and Fifth

Defendants, exercised functions in the Plaintiff company like an executive committee. They

discussed when to pay, whom to pay first and how much to pay. When they were not able to

resolve a particular matter, they would refer it to "the boss", the First

Defendant. The Second Defendant also used money transferred from the Plaintiff company to

the Sixth Defendant to pay the interest on bank loans taken out by her and the Sixth

Defendant for purchasing and developing the land (by constructing the four houses) at Kew

Drive. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 She left for Australia in early 2000 with her husband and the Third

Defendant’s elder son, Calvin, then aged 8, after making arrangements to sell away

their properties and to ship their belongings there.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(3) The Third Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 The Third Defendant was the favourite daughter of the Tongs. She was

a graduate in Accountancy and had working experience in an international accounting firm.

She joined the Plaintiff company around 1995 and headed the accounts departments of the

Plaintiff, the Sixth and the Seventh Defendants. She was a signatory to the

companies’ accounts and worked closely with the then auditor, S K Lai. She resigned

as a director of the Plaintiff company on 27 January 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 She left Singapore for Sydney, Australia in December 1999 and

appeared to have decided to settle down permanently there, even if reluctantly. Her

husband (the Thirteenth Defendant) and their other younger son remained in Singapore, the

husband having bought over 755 Upper East Coast Road from the Second and the Third

Defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 In her affidavit of 25 May 2000, the Third Defendant acknowledged

that the accounts of the Plaintiff company and the Sixth Defendant had been fiddled with

to alter the actual loss situation in the Plaintiff company to that of a profitable one by

transferring the losses to the Sixth Defendant in order to preserve the net worth of the

Plaintiff company at or above $5 million and consequently its G8 status. She claimed,

however, that all this was done on the advice of the company’s auditor, S K Lai.

Incidentally, S K Lai used to be a partner of the Liquidator in an accounting firm at the

relevant time but the Liquidator was not involved in the audit of the Plaintiff company or

its affiliates then.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 In her very telling email sent on 4 May 2000 from Sydney to Mr B M

Singh, she asked the family’s lawyer what would happen if she decided to return to

Singapore to "face the music". She also stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Life holds no meaning for me here. I’m living a lie here, I

  can’t tell people the real reason that I’m in Sydney, and I have to cook up

  stories as to why my husband is in S’pore while I’m in Sydney with my son. I

  even have to resort telling people that I have only 1 son to save the hassle of having to

  explain to them why I have only one son with me …</p>
<p align="justify">I owe my life to my parents …</p>
<p align="justify">I’d rather go back to S’pore, get a job and live a simple

  life. Never mind about luxuries. Calvin can fit into the S’pore education with no

  problem. There was never a need to bring him here – he was doing very well in school

  in S’pore …</p>
<p align="justify">Please tell me it’s possible to come back to S’pore. I

  don’t mind being a bankrupt. I have no face to lose."</p>

(4) The Fourth Defendant</u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 The Fourth Defendant is the younger brother of the Second Defendant.

He is the third youngest sibling among the nine in the Koo family. He was essentially the

man on the ground, spending almost all his working time at the sites supervising the works

and liaising with the numerous subcontractors. He authorized and approved the

certification of the value of work done by the subcontractors but the accounts department

would invariably pay them less than the certified amounts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 When the Plaintiff company’s funds could not meet all the

claims for payments, the Fourth Defendant would be consulted by the Second, the Third and

the Fifth Defendants (the de facto "executive committee") on whom should be paid

first and in what amounts so that the works on the sites could carry on. He was, however,

never involved in the financial matters beyond being asked to rubber stamp the accounts

prepared by the accounts department by signing Directors’ resolutions approving them.

He was never shown the audited accounts and there was never any formal meeting held.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 By the middle of 1998, the problem of non-payment or underpayment

became more serious when the subcontractors affected began to delay their supplies and

services. In May 1999, the electrical contractor went to the extent of shutting off the

power supply at a site. The Fourth Defendant reckoned that the five HDB projects awarded

to the Plaintiff company ought to have been profitable to the extent of $10 million to $15

million.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 The Fourth Defendant was promised some shares in the Plaintiff

company by the First and the Second Defendants but, as the Second Defendant had

consistently told him that the Plaintiff company was losing money, he did not bother to

pursue the matter. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 On 26 February 2000, the Fourth Defendant’s services were

suddenly and unceremoniously terminated by the First Defendant upon the Fourth

Defendant’s return from leave. However, he remained a director of the Seventh

Defendant. No reason was given for the termination. The First Defendant explained in his

testimony in Court that it was essentially due to his discovery that the Fourth Defendant

was corrupt in his dealings with the Plaintiff company’s subcontractors and also that

he had been spreading rumours about the Tong family siphoning the company’s money to

Australia. Until then, the Fourth Defendant had been having a good relationship with the

First and the Second Defendants, with the Tongs and the Koos regularly meeting for dinner

at 2 Kew Drive.<br/>
</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(5) The Fifth Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 The Fifth Defendant had been working for the First Defendant since

she was 19 years old in 1975. She was appointed a director of the Plaintiff company when

it was incorporated in 1985. She was completely trusted by the Tong couple and was also

involved in the Sixth and the Seventh Defendants and in the Tong family’s personal

matters. She held no shares in the companies and was appointed a director to facilitate

the running of the Plaintiff company only. She was not a trained accountant but would

deputize the Third Defendant in her absence. She was in fact the head of both the

administration and the accounts departments before the Third Defendant took over the

accounts department in 1995. Whatever she signed in her capacity as director was at the

First Defendant’s express or implied instructions given to her directly or through

the Second Defendant. She signed contracts and documents relating to the annual accounts

and the bank accounts. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28 The Fifth Defendant knew when payments were made by the HDB to the

Plaintiff company and was aware of the transfers of the money into the personal accounts

of the First and the Second Defendants to earn interest for themselves. She did not know

why the Plaintiff company did not maintain an interest bearing account.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29 On 15 March 2000, she resigned as a director of the Plaintiff

company. </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(6) The Sixth Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30 The Second, Ninth and Tenth Defendants were the directors of the

Sixth Defendant with the Second Defendant holding about 53% of the shares and the First

Defendant about 24%. The rest of the shares were held by the Third and the Ninth

Defendants. Like the Plaintiff company, the Sixth Defendant was insolvent.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31 The Sixth Defendant developed residential projects until 1995/1996

when it became the purported subcontractor for the Plaintiff company’s HDB projects.

The Sixth Defendant was in truth only a subcontractor in name as it had no resources of

its own and was effectively the Plaintiff company’s alter ego. The First Defendant

testified that he incorporated the Sixth Defendant in 1984 as he wanted to have more than

one company to provide for the eventuality that one of his companies could be barred from

tendering for construction jobs. As indicated earlier, the Sixth Defendant became the

vehicle for the Plaintiff company to dump its losses, with the purported accounts showing

the Sixth Defendant owing the Plaintiff company some $19 million as at April 2000. S K

Lai, the auditor, testified that the Third Defendant had misrepresented to him that the

transactions between the Plaintiff company and the Sixth Defendant had a valid commercial

basis. As a result, his audit report did not reflect the true position that emerged during

the trial. </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(7) The Seventh Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32 The Seventh Defendant was wholly owned by the Sixth Defendant. Its

directors were the First, Fourth and Ninth Defendants. It developed a housing project

known as Eastwood Lodge using the Plaintiff company’s funds. The units in the project

were allegedly sold at a loss. As at 30 April 1999, the Seventh Defendant was shown as

owing the Plaintiff company slightly more than $7 million. In May 1999, some $5.55 million

of proceeds of sale were returned to the Plaintiff company, reducing the balance

outstanding at about $1.5 million. Between May and July 2000, the First Defendant took

$482,000 from the Seventh Defendant as the First and Second Defendants required

"living expenses" although the liquidator of the Plaintiff company was told by

the First and Second Defendants when he met them in August 2000 in Australia that the

Seventh Defendant had no money.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(8) The Eighth Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33 The Eighth Defendant used to be known as Tong Tien See Holding

(Australia) Pty Ltd. It was incorporated in Sydney, Australia in October 1994. By a deed

dated 5 October 1994, it became a trust corporation for the Tong family. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34 The First, Second, Third and the Twelfth Defendants (the younger

sister of the Second Defendant) were the directors of the Eighth Defendant. The First,

Second and Third Defendants used to hold 33.3% of the shares each. In November 1998, the

Twelfth Defendant became the only shareholder and in November 1999, she became the sole

director. In January 2000, it adopted the present name.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35 The Eighth Defendant had two properties in its name. One was 39A

Hydebrae Street in Sydney and the other was an apartment at The Stamford, 52-56 Goderich

Street in Perth. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36 When the Court ordered the disclosure of the accounting records and

the bank statements of the Eighth Defendant, the Twelfth Defendant claimed that they were

in the accountants’ office for the preparation of accounts and that the said office

had unfortunately just been broken into and vandalized. Although the Twelfth Defendant

informed the Court in May 2001 during her testimony that she had written to the Eighth

Defendant’s banks for a copy of the bank statements, nothing has been made available

to the Plaintiff company so far. </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(9) The Ninth Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37 The Ninth Defendant was a director and shareholder of the Sixth

Defendant and a director of the Seventh Defendant. She was also a co-signatory for the

Plaintiff company’s bank accounts. She studied music in Australia in 1982. In 1991,

she married and then moved to Hong Kong to work for two years. In 1993, she returned to

Singapore and was the Managing Director of a trading and forex company owned by her and

her husband which operated for three years. She claimed that she only did basic records

and was not conversant at all with accounting and financial matters.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38 The Ninth Defendant managed the First Defendant’s bank accounts

in Australia, opened in the name of Francis Tong. The First Defendant had initially denied

having such a name or such accounts when cross-examined by Counsel for the Plaintiff

company but when he returned after the lunch break, he claimed to have spoken to the Ninth

Defendant who told him that she had chosen a Western name for him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39 The Ninth Defendant was the Plaintiff company’s Human Resource

Manager. She was in the office for only a few hours a day. She claimed that her

appointment was in name only and that she was actually paid by the Plaintiff company to be

at the beck and call of the First Defendant 24 hours a day, seven days a week. </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(10) The Tenth Defendant</p>
<p align="justify">(11) The Eleventh Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40 These were the 33 year old twin daughters of the Tongs. The Tenth

Defendant is not married. She was a director of the Sixth Defendant. The Eleventh

Defendant is married to Er Chuan Lee who also worked for the Plaintiff company. The

Eleventh Defendant and her husband were appointed directors of the Plaintiff company on 28

February 2000. The twin sisters appeared to be less favoured by their parents than the

Third and the Ninth Defendants. They worked as site clerks in the Plaintiff company.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41 On 18 February 2000, the Tenth Defendant left for Sydney as

instructed by her parents, to help out with household chores and to look after the Third

Defendant’s elder son, Calvin. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42 Like the others, she said that she signed documents as a director

without question or thought.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43 In February 2000, the Second and the Eleventh Defendants opened a

joint bank account so that the latter could pay for the outgoings of 2 Kew Drive as her

mother was not going to be around for some time. She was also given a power of attorney by

the Third Defendant to sell the Third Defendant’s residential properties. However,

she did not seem to know anything about the sales besides having to go to the

solicitors’ office to sign some documents. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44 On 27 April 2000, when the then Provisional Liquidator and his team

entered the Plaintiff company’s premises, the Eleventh Defendant was instructed by

her father, the First Defendant, to call the police to evict them. The Tenth Defendant and

the Ninth Defendant’s husband were also present at the office that evening. After the

police arrived and advised the Provisional Liquidator and his team to leave, the Fifth,

the Tenth and the Eleventh Defendants, with the assistance of some others, removed the

files of the Sixth and the Seventh Defendants from the Plaintiff company’s office.

The Sixth and the Seventh Defendants have commenced an action against the Liquidator

arising from the events that evening. </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(12) The Twelfth Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45 The Twelfth Defendant undertook a nursing course in England and then

moved to Australia where she met and married her husband, Thava Rasiah. She became an

Australian citizen. They operated two McDonald's restaurants in Sydney. The Twelfth

Defendant claimed that they had six such outlets previously. She was very dear to the

First and the Second Defendants and was their nominee in the Eighth Defendant. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46 The Twelfth Defendant and her husband owned one property held in the

name of their company. They also owned jointly several other properties. They had loans

amounting to some A$3.5 million. Their companies’ tax returns showed losses from 1996

to 1999 and a small profit of A$21,000 in 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47 The Twelfth Defendant claimed that she was told in November 1999 by

her sister, the Second Defendant, of their intention to move to Australia because of

Calvin’s enrolment in a school in Sydney. She claimed she had no knowledge of the

financial woes of the Plaintiff company. The Second Defendant asked her for financial help

to purchase a larger house as the one at 39A Hydebrae Street was too small for the family

and too far from Calvin’s school. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48 The Twelfth Defendant said that in November 1999, when the Second

Defendant visited Sydney, the Twelfth Defendant contemplated purchasing a rather large

house at 17 Woodward Avenue. The following month, she agreed to purchase it for A$1.47

million. The deal was completed in March 2000 and the house was registered in her sole

name. The Twelfth Defendant claimed that she borrowed A$670,000 from the First Defendant

for the purchase and the remaining A$800,000 came from her and her husband. The evidence

showed that the property was mortgaged for A$800,000 several months after the completion. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49 The Twelfth Defendant claimed that she then rented the house to the

Tongs. According to the Tongs, the rental was not a fixed amount. The Twelfth Defendant

also claimed that she did not rent out one of her properties which was vacant to the Tongs

as the First Defendant did not like to live in old houses.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(13) The Thirteenth Defendant</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50 The Thirteenth Defendant is the husband of the Third Defendant. He

worked as a fuel oil broker earning about $12,000 gross salary per month. They married in

1990 and lived in her parents’ home at 2 Kew Drive until 1996 when they shifted to

the newly built 755 Upper East Coast Road, next door. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51 The Thirteenth Defendant claimed that he had no interest in the Tong

family’s affairs and did not discuss such matters with his wife. He said his working

hours caused him to be away from home most of the time anyway. He claimed his wife left

for Australia in December 1999 as it was her dream to send Calvin to study abroad. He only

knew that she was leaving about one week before her departure. He also said that he

discovered the true reason for her departure only in March 2000 as he and his wife were

going through a bad patch before that. He did not even know that his wife had sold her car

until after the sale as she used to park it next door at her parents’ home. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52 The Thirteenth Defendant bought over 755 Upper East Coast Road from

the Second and the Third Defendants in March 2000 for $1.7 million as he needed a home for

his second son, his father and his brother. He took a bank loan of $1.19 million, withdrew

$170,000 from his CPF savings and paid $340,000 (or 20% of the purchase price) in cash.

The amount of cash came from his savings, winnings from illegal gambling and loans from

family members, including Peggy Koo, the youngest sister of the Second and the Fourth

Defendants, who lent him $230,000 for three years free of interest. Although he claimed

that 10% of the price was paid upon exercise of the option and the remaining 10% upon

completion, the solicitors’ completion accounts indicated that no money was paid

until completion. He claimed that he did pay in the manner stated by him but did not know

how his solicitors dealt with the matter.<br/>
</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify">THE ACTS COMPLAINED OF</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53 The directors formally appointed in the Plaintiff company were the

First, Third, Fourth and Fifth Defendants. It was not disputed that the relevant

Defendants, as directors, were under a fiduciary duty and had to act honestly and in good

faith in the best interests of the company.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54 When a company is solvent, its interests and those of its

shareholders are one. In this case, there would not even be divergence of interests

between the company and its shareholders as they were in reality the First and the Second

Defendants. But when a company is insolvent, the interests of its creditors become the

dominant factor in what constitutes the benefit of the company as a whole (<i>West Mercia

Safetywear Ltd v Dodd</i> <nobr>[1988] BCLC 250</nobr>).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55 A company is insolvent or unable to pay its debts when it is unable

to meet current demands, irrespective of whether the company is possessed of assets which,

if realized, would enable it to discharge its liabilities in full. Insolvency in this

commercial sense is principally a question of fact which may be established in a number of

ways. However, proof that a creditor’s debt has not been paid per se does not

establish an inability to pay debts within the meaning of Section 254(2)(c) of the

Companies Act. A temporary lack of liquidity does not tantamount to insolvency (see <i>Re

Sanpete Builders (S) Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1989] 1 MLJ 393</nobr>).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56 From the evidence adduced, the Plaintiff company was plainly

insolvent from about 1995 and this fact was well known to the First, Second and Third

Defendants. The Fourth and the Fifth Defendants learnt of the consistent losses in the

projects from the Second Defendant. However, the accounts of the Plaintiff company were

manipulated to show profitability and to maintain falsely the G8 grading so that the

company could continue to be awarded multi-million dollar jobs. The First and the Second

Defendants claimed that they were in fact trying to save the company by hoping to reap

enough profits from the later projects to pay off the company’s debts. In truth, they

were robbing Peter to pay Paul by using the new projects’ proceeds to pay the debts

of the old projects and even then, not all of Peter’s money went to Paul. In the

meantime, far from trying to trim the expenses of the Plaintiff company, they continued as

if the company was riding the crest of prosperity and projected a completely false image

to the certifying authority, the owners of the projects and the company’s

subcontractors and suppliers. They also continued to use the Plaintiff company’s

funds for their personal benefit. They needed a continuous stream of new projects to feed

the debts of the old ones and when the drought descended upon the company after 1997 (when

no new major project was forthcoming), they realized they had run out of Peters while the

number of Pauls continued to increase. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57 The auditor, S K Lai, denied that he had advised the Third Defendant

in the "creative accounting" that she had done with the books of the Plaintiff

company and the Sixth Defendant. His accuser refused to come to Court to substantiate her

statements. I had no reason to doubt his testimony. The Third Defendant was quite capable

of writing or rewriting the accounts herself.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58 The subcontractors and suppliers that dealt with the Plaintiff

company were not deceived so much by the false accounts as by the consequences arising

from the false accounts. The Plaintiff company was able to maintain and renew its G8

status and tender for public projects of unlimited value because of this and, to those in

the building industry, the G8 grading must surely be the hallmark of creditworthiness.

They were therefore deluded into entering contracts with the Plaintiff company and would

be more indulgent when told by the Plaintiff company to wait for payment or full payment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59 No formal Annual General Meeting or Directors’ Meeting was held

in the Plaintiff company or its affiliates for the past several years. The Fourth and the

Fifth Defendants were told to append their signatures to the company’s records. If

they should protest or refuse to comply in any way, it was certain they would incur the

wrath of the First Defendant and be removed as directors and most probably as employees of

the Plaintiff company as well. The two directors who knew exactly what was going on and

who could exercise their mind in the matter were the First and the Third Defendants, who

were clearly in breach of their duties as directors. Bearing in mind the peculiar

circumstances of this case and the omnipotence of the overbearing First Defendant in the

Plaintiff company, I did not think that the Fourth and the Fifth Defendants should be held

accountable as directors for the false accounts of the Plaintiff company.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60 Similarly, where the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Defendants (the other

three daughters) were concerned, they were also subject to the overbearing influence of

the First Defendant (more so for the twin sisters than the Ninth Defendant) and should not

be held accountable as having knowingly assisted the First and the Third Defendants in

their breach of duty. The twin sisters were not in the office most of the time and

certainly were not involved in management decisions. The Ninth Defendant was more a

fun-loving and carefree person than someone involved in account-twisting and intrigue. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61 The Sixth and Seventh Defendants were in truth the alter ego of the

First and the Second Defendants and had obviously been used to facilitate the First and

Third Defendants’ breaches of duty. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61 The Second Defendant was not formally appointed a director of the

Plaintiff company but was patently the First Defendant’s alter ego in the company.

She was active in the business and was known to be the boss’s wife. She was the true

Deputy Managing Director of the Plaintiff company and controlled the purse strings. Her

words would be obeyed by those in the Plaintiff company as unquestioningly as if they

emanated from the First Defendant himself. She would fall squarely within the extended

meaning of "director" (as underlined) in Section 4(1) of the Companies Act which

reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">""director" includes any person occupying the position

  of director of a corporation by whatever name called and <u>includes a person in

  accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of a corporation are

  accustomed to act</u> and an alternate or substitute director."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The words underscored in the definition above are also the "shadow

director" mentioned in Section 149(8) of the Companies Act.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62 Millet J in <i>Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd</i> <nobr>[1994] 2 BCLC 180</nobr> said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"To establish that a defendant is a shadow director of a company,

  it is necessary to allege and prove : </p>
<p align="justify">(1) who are the directors of the company, whether de facto or de jure;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) that the defendant directed those directors how to act in relation

  to the company or that he was one of the persons who did so;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) that those directors acted in accordance with such directions; and </p>
<p align="justify">(4) that they were accustomed so to act. What is needed is first, a

  board of directors claiming and purporting to act as such; and secondly, a pattern of

  behaviour in which the board did not exercise any discretion or judgment of its own, but

  acted in accordance with the directions of others."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Although the Second Defendant consulted and discussed company matters

with the Third, Fourth and Fifth Defendants, there could be no doubt who would be the

decision-maker and that they would carry out whatever she instructed them to do. She was

therefore also under the same duties along with the First and the Third Defendants and,

like her husband and her daughter, was equally guilty of a breach of those duties</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63 The First, Second and Third Defendants were the ones with intimate

knowledge of how the Plaintiff company was faring over the years and the ins and outs of

the Plaintiff company’s money. Knowing that the Plaintiff company was in dire

financial straits, they nevertheless used the false accounts to create the G8 veil to

shield the true state of the Plaintiff company from the eyes of the subcontractors and

suppliers. They knew that the existing creditors could only be paid by the "Rob Peter

to pay Paul" scheme described earlier and that at any one time, there would be some

creditors who could not be paid in full or at all. They had thereby carried on the

business of the company with intent to defraud its creditors. The three of them were

clearly parties to the carrying on of the business in that manner knowingly. Indeed, they

were the directing minds. They should therefore be personally liable without any

limitation of liability for all the debts of the Plaintiff company (in this case $53.3

million) pursuant to Section 340(1) of the Companies Act which reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"<b>340.</b>–-(1) If, in the course of the winding up of a

  company or in any proceedings against a company, it appears that any business of the

  company has been carried on with the intent to defraud creditors of the company or

  creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court, on the application

  of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks proper

  to do so, declare that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the

  business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of

  liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the Court

  directs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The imposition of a criminal sanction in Section 340(5) does not bar

the declaratory relief sought by the Liquidator here (see Section 39 of the Interpretation

Act).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64 Before the financial year 1995/1996, the Plaintiff company

purportedly used the "full completion method" in its accounts for the projects,

recognizing and recording revenue only when the projects in question were fully completed.

The Liquidator has shown that such an accounting policy was not adhered to for the

financial years of 1993/1994 and 1994/1995 and if such a policy had been observed, the

Plaintiff company would not have the $5 million net worth necessary for a G8 grading. For

financial year 1995/1996, the Plaintiff company then moved the losses back to the previous

financial years by means of a Prior Year Adjustment on the basis that the "Percentage

of Completion" method of accounting introduced by the Third Defendant was more

appropriate.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65 A "one-off" revaluation of the Plaintiff company’s

plant and machinery was carried out for the financial year 1995/1996 by valuers appointed

by the Plaintiff company and based on the report dated 26 September 1996, a

"Revaluation Reserve" of some $2.6 million was reflected in the audited

accounts. The Liquidator questioned the bona fides of this exercise which, in his view,

was necessitated by the prior year adjustment in order to maintain the $5 million net

worth of the company. The Liquidator’s valuer testified as an expert witness and the

essence of his evidence was that the revaluation appeared to have confused and combined

the two concepts of fair market value and existing or continuing use and that the values

given were on the high side. However, the Plaintiff company’s valuer had the

advantage of inspecting the plant and machinery at the relevant time. Even if his

valuation was erroneously high in some aspects, there was no evidence to show that it was

deliberately so and that it was a result of collusion between the Plaintiff company and

the valuer. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66 Between 1995 to 2000, the First and Second Defendants also

periodically caused to be transferred amounts totalling cumulatively $194 million from the

Plaintiff company to their personal accounts to earn interest. While they did return the

principal amounts and did pay personal income tax on the interest earned, this practice

was done when the Plaintiff company was insolvent. There was no reason why the Plaintiff

company could not open an interest-bearing account. The Plaintiff company was therefore

deprived of income that should have gone into its coffers. The cumulative amount of

interest earned this way was about $280,000 calculated on the basis of the number of days

the funds were in the First and Second Defendants’ personal accounts and an average

interest rate of 4% per annum.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67 The First and Second Defendants also made use of the Plaintiff

company’s funds to purchase land to develop residential properties in Singapore.

These properties were registered in the names of the Second and the Third Defendants. As

indicated earlier, 4 Kew Drive was bought and four houses were built thereon. The land

cost for the plot of land was $3.1 million, out of which $2.5 million were from overdraft

facilities provided to the Second and Third Defendants by OCBC Bank and the balance was

said to be from the First and the Second Defendants. The building costs were also funded

with a loan from the same bank. Although the Second and the Third Defendants were the

purported borrowers, the interest payable was paid by the Sixth Defendant using the

Plaintiff company’s funds. One of the four houses (757 Upper East Coast Road) was

sold in July 1996 for $3 million reaping in profits of about $501,000 for the Second and

the Third Defendants. 755 Upper East Coast Road was occupied by the Third Defendant and

her husband, the Thirteenth Defendant and their family. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68 The Plaintiff company also accepted, through the First Defendant, an

additional facility from the same bank in March 1997. The remaining three houses, together

with 2 Kew Drive and an Ocean Park apartment, were mortgaged to OCBC Bank at the material

times. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69 In January 2000, 4 and 4A Kew Drive and 755 Upper East Coast Road

were purportedly sold to the Sixth Defendant at 10% above valuation to reduce the First

and Second Defendants’ indebtedness to the Sixth Defendant. Although the transaction

was recorded in the accounting books of the Sixth Defendant, the properties remained in

the names of the Second and the Third Defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70 In the following month, those three properties together with 2 Kew

Drive and the Ocean Park apartment and the balance sale proceeds of Eastwood Lodge

developed by the Seventh Defendant were treated as assets of the Plaintiff company in the

computation of dividends payable to unsecured creditors for the purposes of the Judicial

Management application. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71 The Ocean Park apartment (528 East Coast Road #19-03 Ocean Park) was

bought by the First Defendant in March 1990. He said he could not recall whether he had

borrowed the Plaintiff company’s funds in the purchase. As this property was way

outside the period in question in these proceedings (1995 to 2000) and the evidence was

not compelling, I did not find that this apartment was in truth the Plaintiff

company’s. My comments apply equally to 2 Kew Drive, the home of the First and the

Second Defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72 The Eastwood Lodge project was sold in April 1999. The Liquidator

claimed that the Seventh Defendant owed the Plaintiff company some $7 million while the

Seventh Defendant admitted having received only $5.755 million from the Plaintiff company.

However, the Fourth Defendant as a director of the Seventh Defendant had confirmed in

writing that the Seventh Defendant was owing the Plaintiff company about $7 million in

April 1999. Between 1995 and 2000, the Sixth Defendant also transferred about $8.66

million to the Seventh Defendant. After the sale of the apartments in Eastwood Lodge, some

$5.55 million were paid to the Plaintiff company, leaving about $1.5 million outstanding.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73 It was subsequently discovered by the Liquidator that $482,000 had

been withdrawn by the First Defendant between 28 May and 24 July 2000 after the winding up

order on 26 May 2000. The Second Defendant testified that they needed this amount as their

"living expenses". In February 2000, the directors were also expecting $1.024

million as "Balance receivable from sale of Eastwood apartments (receivable after

CSC)" and treated that amount as the Plaintiff company’s asset in its

computation of dividends payable to unsecured creditors. It was not shown what had

happened to the $1.024 million.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74 Clearly, therefore the Plaintiff company’s funds had been used

through the instrumentality of the Sixth and the Seventh Defendants to develop the four

houses and Eastwood Lodge and the company had an interest in them or in their sale

proceeds. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75 On 2 March 2000, the Third Defendant appointed the Eleventh

Defendant (her sister) as her attorney to sell 4, 4A and 755 Upper East Coast Road. Her

role was only to sign for the Third Defendant. Every aspect of the sale was apparently

taken care of by the First, Second and the Third Defendants and their solicitors. All the

five mortgaged properties were sold between 15 March 2000 and 9 May 2000 after a letter of

demand dated 15 March 2000 was received from OCBC Bank. The proceeds were used to

discharge the loan from the bank. However, there appeared to be a surplus of about

$500,000 unaccounted for after the indebtedness to the bank (about $11 million) was

discharged.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76 Between November 1994 and April 1997, the Plaintiff company

transferred a total of $984,899.60 to the Eighth Defendant in Australia. By a

Directors’ resolution in April 1998, the debt was transferred from the Eighth

Defendant to the First Defendant. The First and the Second Defendants used the Plaintiff

company’s funds to purchase properties in Australia in the name of the Eighth

Defendant. Two have been identified – 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney and the Goderich

Street apartment in Perth. 39A Hydebrae Street was one of the two houses built on the

property known as 39 Hydebrae Street. The other was sold in 1996. Another, 70 Barker Road,

was said by the First Defendant to have been sold and the proceeds spent for living

expenses. The Twelfth Defendant (the Second Defendant’s younger sister in Australia)

testified that 70 Barker Road was sold in September 1999 for about A$800,000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">77 In all likelihood, the sale proceeds of 70 Barker Road were used to

purchase 17 Woodward Avenue in December 1999, the large house in Australia which the Tongs

are now living in. The Twelfth Defendant’s evidence was self-contradictory. If her

sister (the Second Defendant) did not have enough funds to purchase a larger house, it was

indeed strange that her husband (the First Defendant) could then give the Twelfth

Defendant a loan of A$670,000 for the purchase of 17 Woodward Avenue. Further, this was

the only property in her sole name unlike the others which she had purchased earlier with

her husband. Being so highly geared financially already, what was her purpose in

purchasing such a large house at A$1.47 million?</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">78 The timing was also uncanny – the agreement was entered into at

the time when the Tongs were obviously preparing to move permanently from Singapore to

Australia. The size of the house also coincided with the desire of the Tongs for more

spacious accommodation and the rental that they claimed they were paying to the Twelfth

Defendant was nebulous. The loan of A$800,000 came about only in August 2000, some five

months after the completion of the purchase. Together with the facts that the name of the

Eighth Defendant was changed in January 2000 and the rumours that were rife in Singapore

that the First Defendant had siphoned off lots of money to Australia, I had no doubt

whatsoever that 17 Woodward Avenue was bought by the Twelfth Defendant under the

instructions of the First and the Second Defendants and that the funds for that purchase

were from the Eighth Defendant which was in turn funded by the Plaintiff company. Adverse

inferences must be drawn against the Twelfth Defendant for her reluctance to produce the

Eighth Defendant’s records. The alleged untimely burglary and vandalization in the

Twelfth Defendant’s accountants’ office were nothing more than a lame excuse

towards this end. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">79 It was also clear that the Plaintiff company’s funds of up to

$3.7 million were utilized by the First, Second and the Third Defendants for their

personal benefit between 1996 and 2000 when the Plaintiff company was having difficulties

paying its creditors. Examples of such personal benefit were detailed by the Liquidator as

payment of income tax, payment for share transactions and for personal investments in

Australia.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">80 Where remuneration paid to the First, Second and Third Defendants by

the Plaintiff company and the Sixth Defendant was concerned, I did not think it right to

hold that once a person is found to have acted in breach of his fiduciary duties, he has

to disgorge all payments made to him by way of salary. The question must be asked whether

the salary of the First, Second and the Third Defendants was something they would have

been entitled to if they had not breached their fiduciary duties. Plainly, they could not

be expected to work for free once the company became insolvent. The payment of the salary

was not the breach itself, unlike unjust enrichment situations where the money in the

hands of the person who has breached his duties would not have been there but for the

breach. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">81 The Liquidator also alleged conspiracy on the part of the Defendants

to injure and/or damage the Plaintiff company by the use of unlawful means. In the light

of what I have discussed above, clearly the First, Second, Third and the Sixth Defendants

were involved in such a conspiracy and should be liable for the loss/damage suffered to

the extent of $53.3 million. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">82 The claim against the Thirteenth Defendant was for a declaration

that 755 Upper East Coast Road was sold by the Second and the Third Defendants to him in

breach of Section 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act which provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"(1) Except as provided in this section, every conveyance of

  property, made whether before or after 12<sup>th</sup> November 1993, with intent to

  defraud creditors, shall be voidable, at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) This section does not affect the law relating to bankruptcy for the

  time being in force.</p>
<p align="justify">(3) This section does not extend to any estate or interest in property

  disposed of for valuable consideration and in good faith or upon good consideration and in

  good faith to any person not having, at the time of the disposition, notice of intent to

  defraud creditors."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Liquidator argued that the sale in March 2000 at $1.7 million when

the Second and the Third Defendants had already left Singapore was consistent with their

intention to make themselves judgment-proof. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">83 The sale at that price was approved by OCBC Bank, the mortgagee,

even if it appeared to be below open market valuation. The documentary evidence pertaining

to the completion emanating from the Thirteenth Defendant’s solicitors showed that no

payment was made for the option or upon its exercise until completion on 14 July 2000.

This contradicted the Thirteenth Defendant’s evidence that he paid $10,000 for the

option, 10% of the purchase price (including the $10,000) upon the exercise of the option

and another 10% on completion. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">84 There was no dispute that the Thirteenth Defendant utilized $170,000

of his CPF savings and took a bank loan of $1,190,000. The bone of contention was the

source of the 20% cash outlay ($340,000). He stated it was from his savings and later

amplied that to his savings, winnings from gambling, a loan from one of his brothers,

money left to him by his deceased mother and a three-year loan of $230,000 from the Second

Defendant’s youngest sister, Peggy Koo. He denied that it had anything to do with the

$350,000 withdrawn by the First Defendant from the Seventh Defendant in May 2000. The

Fourth Defendant expressed surprise that Peggy Koo had lent $230,000 to the Thirteenth

Defendant. When he was required to put up bail of $350,000 after he was charged for

criminal offences by the CPIB and approached Peggy Koo (his sister) for a loan, she said

she could only afford to lend $10,000. Secondly, he did not think that the Thirteenth

Defendant and Peggy Koo were very close to each other. It should be noted that his bail

money was required only in February 2001, about 10 or 11 months after Peggy Koo was said

to have made the loan to the Thirteenth Defendant. No party called Peggy Koo to testify in

Court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">85 The Thirteenth Defendant’s gross salary was about $12,000 per

month. His take-home pay was $10,799. He was paid a bonus of one and a half months for

2000. The monthly instalments of about $4,200 were paid from his CPF savings and with cash

of $1,863 per month.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">86 The Liquidator also alleged that the sale price of $1.7 million was

an undervalue. A valuation report by Jones Lang La Salle in December 1999 stated the open

market value of 755 Upper East Coast Road as $1.92 million and the forced sale value at

$1.7 million. Further, 4 and 4A Kew Drive, which had land areas of about 50 square metres

smaller than 755 Upper East Coast Road were sold in May 2000 at $1.66 million and in April

2000 at $1.8 million respectively. Hence, despite the avowed intention of the First

Defendant not to have the properties sold at a forced sale by the mortgagee bank, 755

Upper East Coast Road was nonetheless sold as if it were a forced sale. Accordingly, the

Liquidator asked that the sale be declared void and that the property be reconveyed to the

Plaintiff company free of encumbrance with the Thirteenth Defendant having to discharge

the existing mortgages before reconveyance. He asked that 755 be sold subsequently and the

net proceeds be distributed equally between the Liquidator and the Official Assignee

(because of the bankruptcy of the Third Defendant). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">87 The Thirteenth Defendant alleged that the Liquidator was aware of

the sale of 755 Upper East Coast Road to the Thirteenth Defendant as the details of the

sale of all the five properties were clearly set out in the Third Defendant’s

affidavit of 25 May 2000 in the winding up proceedings. However, he did nothing about it

until 22 June 2000 when he instructed his solicitors to write to the solicitors for the

Second and the Third Defendants demanding that all the proceeds of sale be paid to him or

be held by the solicitors for the Second and the Third Defendants as stakeholders. The

said Defendants’ solicitors could not accede to his demand. The proceeds of sale were

paid to OCBC Bank as the mortgagee bank. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">88 While the Thirteenth Defendant’s evidence as to the source of

the $340,000 was far from satisfactory, it was not shown by the Liquidator that the money

had come from any of the Defendants or from the Plaintiff company’s funds. The

property was sold at a forced sale value but that was done with the approval of the bank.

It was one of the five properties sold to discharge the outstanding loan and it could not

be said that the proceeds from the other four would be used first by the bank and that

there would therefore be a surplus. Indeed, it was the first of the five to be sold and if

the first-in, first-out principle was applied, the entire proceeds would have gone to the

mortgagee-bank in any event, even if the price was for much more than $1.7 million.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">89 However, I rejected the Thirteenth Defendant’s claim of

ignorance about the Tong family’s financial woes and that he was unaware of their

plans to take flight to Australia. After all, his young son (Calvin) was involved and his

younger son would be separated from his mother for a considerable period of time. It was

too much of a coincidence that he would also be having such a "bad patch" with

the Third Defendant then that she would keep him totally in the dark about what was going

on. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">90 In the financial analysis, the bank was not defrauded and the other

creditors of the Second Defendant, the Third Defendant or the Plaintiff company could not

have been defrauded. It was therefore difficult to infer an "intent to defraud

creditors" in the circumstances. The Liquidator therefore failed in his claim against

the Thirteenth Defendant. In any event, it could not be right to make the Thirteenth

Defendant pay the bank and the CPF the amounts he had borrowed in order that the Plaintiff

company or the Official Assignee could benefit. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">91 This case has demonstrated the great difficulties involved in

identifying the sources of funds and the way they were used or rolled over. Having made

the conclusions set out above and with the consequential orders that would follow

therefrom, I did not think it necessary that these proceedings should be further extended

by making tracing orders against the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh and the Eighth

Defendants. </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

THE ORDERS MADE</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">92 The orders made are set out in the sequence in which the relevant

prayers for relief appeared in the Amended Statement of Claim. I granted judgment against

the First, Second, Third and Sixth Defendants for the loss/damage suffered by the

Plaintiff company by reason of the conspiracy to injure by unlawful means in the sum of

$53.3 million. Alternatively, the said Defendants were liable to the Plaintiff company for

the said loss/damage as constructive trustees.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">93 I gave judgment against the First, Second and Third Defendants for

the loss/damage suffered by the Plaintiff company by reason of their breaches of fiduciary

duty in the sum of $53.3 million and granted the declaration sought that the said

Defendants were constructive trustees for the Plaintiff company in respect of the said sum

and that they should account to the Plaintiff company for this sum and pay it to the

Plaintiff company accordingly. I also granted a declaration that the four properties

developed on the land previously known as 4 Kew Drive were held in trust for the Plaintiff

company. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">94 I granted a declaration that the First, Second and Third Defendants

were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of the Plaintiff company with

intent to defraud its creditors and that they were liable to the Plaintiffs for the said

$53.3 million. Alternatively, the said Defendants were liable as constructive trustees. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">95 Judgment was ordered against the Eighth and the Twelfth Defendants

for a declaration that they held $984,899.60 as constructive trustees for the Plaintiff

company and that they should account to the Plaintiff company for the said sum. They were

also declared the constructive trustees for the Plaintiff company in respect of the

following Australian properties:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1) 39A Hydebrae Street, Sydney;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Stamford Apartment, Goderich Street, Perth; and</p>
<p align="justify">(3) 17 Woodward Avenue, Sydney.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Should all or any portion of the said $984,899.60 have been expended on

any of the abovementioned three properties, the amount due would be extinguished or

diminished to that extent. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">96 The Plaintiff company was also given a declaration that the Seventh

Defendant received $7 million from the Plaintiff company as constructive trustees and it

should account for the use of this $7 million including the outstanding amount of $1.5

million.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">97 The total amount due to the Plaintiff company in respect of all the

above orders should be $53.3 million and any amount realized from any of the Defendants

pursuant to the above orders would reduce the total to that extent.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">98 The injunction dated 9 October 2000 should continue against the

First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and The Twelfth Defendants. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">99 Simple interest awarded on all sums due was to run from the date of

the Writ of Summons.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">100 The Plaintiff company was also awarded taxed costs against the

First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Twelfth Defendants. In view of the more

limited role played by the Twelfth Defendant and the insolvency of most of the other

Defendants, I acceded to the request that her liability for the Plaintiff company’s

costs be limited to a fair proportion which I fixed at 25%. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">101 The Plaintiff company’s claims against the Fourth, Fifth,

Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and Thirteenth Defendants were dismissed and the injunction against

them was discharged accordingly. There was no order to assess any damages suffered as a

result of the injunction as the Liquidator, with the knowledge gleaned from the documents

made available to him, had rightly taken out the injunction against all of them. I awarded

taxed costs to these Defendants but directed that such costs be paid by the First, Second,

Third and Sixth Defendants as these proceedings were essentially the result of what they

had done. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">102 I also awarded a certificate for two Counsel to both Ms Belinda

Ang, S.C. and Mr B Mohan Singh.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">103 The Defendants had taken out various applications to set aside the

injunction but these were adjourned to be dealt with at the trial. In view of the above

orders, I made no order on these applications except that costs be in the cause. </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

THE APPEALS</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">104 In Civil Appeal 600124 of 2001, the Eighth and the Twelfth

Defendants are appealing to the Court of Appeal against those parts of my decision

affecting them. In Civil Appeal 600128 of 2001, the First, Second and the Third Defendants

are appealing against those parts of my decision affecting them. Civil Appeal 600130 of

2001 is the appeal by the Plaintiff company against the dismissal of its claim against the

Thirteenth Defendant and the refusal to make tracing orders against the First, Second,

Third, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Defendants. </p>
