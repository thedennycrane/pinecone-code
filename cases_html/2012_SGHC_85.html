<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action concerns a businesswoman, her renovation
                    contractor and a fortune-teller. What brought these three
                    individuals together? According to the businesswoman, it was
                    a conspiracy by the fortune teller and the renovation
                    contractor to cheat her of money, with the assistance of
                    “black magic”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> but according to the renovation contractor, it
                    was a “love” affair that he had with the
                    businesswoman. What motivated the businesswoman to commence
                    these proceedings particularly since this action concerns
                    events that took place some years ago in 2005/2006? On the
                    businesswoman’s own evidence, the impetus for
                    commencing this action has its roots in a conversation that
                    she had with the fortune-teller’s former husband in
                    2009. According to the businesswoman, it was this
                    conversation that broke her from the “black
                    magic” spell.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The fortune-teller’s former husband
                    claimed to have told the businesswoman that he suspected his
                    wife of having an affair with the contractor. Although his
                    evidence was contested, this revelation might well explain
                    her motivation in bringing this action. Though a
                    litigant’s motivation for instituting an action may
                    not be strictly relevant, I thought it would be useful to
                    place some context on why this action was brought so many
                    years after the fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The action involves two distinct sets of claims. The first
                    set, which I shall refer to as the “Trust and
                    Blackmail Claims”, arises from various payments made
                    by the first plaintiff, Ms Tee Yok Kiat (who is also
                    known as Sarah) (“Sarah”), to the first
                    defendant, Mr Pang Min Seng (who is also known as Andy)
                    (“Andy”). In essence, Sarah alleges that Andy
                    was to hold some money (“the Trust Money”) on
                    trust for the purpose of investing in land and property in
                    China. Alternatively, Sarah alleges that Andy held the Trust
                    Money on a resulting trust. Sarah claims that Andy breached
                    the trust by failing to use the Trust Money for investment.
                    Andy admits that he received the Trust Money. He claims,
                    however, that Sarah had given him the Trust Money as a gift
                    because they were having an intimate relationship. Sarah is
                    also claiming another sum of money (“the Blackmail
                    Money”) from Andy which she says was paid after Andy
                    harassed and intimidated her. The claim for the Trust Money
                    is also brought against the second defendant, Ms Poh Saipin
                    (who is also known as Tik) (“Tik”), who
                    according to the plaintiffs is a fortune-teller, for
                    conspiracy by unlawful means, dishonest assistance, knowing
                    receipt and unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The second set of claims, which I shall refer to as the
                    “Contract Claims”, arises from an unrelated
                    transaction between both plaintiffs and Tik. The plaintiffs
                    allege that they were induced into entering into an
                    agreement with Tik to invest in her business to sell the
                    “POLICE” brand of apparel as a result of
                    Tik’s false representations. They also claim that Tik
                    breached various clauses of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I should mention that Andy conducted the entire trial in
                    person. The plaintiffs were also unrepresented for most of
                    the trial having only been represented on the first day of
                    the trial which was abruptly adjourned due to some health
                    issues affecting Tik’s lead counsel. At the close of
                    the case, I suggested to the plaintiffs as well as Andy that
                    they should consider engaging counsel to assist in the
                    preparation of the closing submissions given the
                    multiplicity of issues which have to be addressed in light
                    of the substantial documents and transcripts of the
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Sarah is a financial consultant and a real estate
                        agent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The second plaintiff, Ms Tee Yok Lee (who is
                    also known as Ivy) (“Ivy”), is Sarah’s
                    elder sister.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> She is a housewife and her role in this action
                    is limited to the Contract Claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Andy was previously a partner in a business known as
                    “Bumi Megah Timber Wood” (“Bumi
                    Megah”), together with his sister, Ms Pang Mei
                    Huei (“Ms Pang”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He resigned from Bumi Megah in 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Andy’s role in this action is limited to
                    the Trust and Blackmail Claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Tik, a Thai national, describes herself as a
                    “businesswoman involved in selling religious statues
                    and ornaments” through a sole proprietorship known as

                    goodwill and for free”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> However, occasionally, the persons for whom she
                    reads cards give her “red packets” as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Sarah’s explanation of the circumstances and the
                    purposes for which the Trust Money was paid is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     Sarah claims that Tik told her after reading her cards
                        that her husband was probably having an affair with a
                        female colleague.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> On Tik’s advice, she decided to
                        conceal her money so that her husband would not have a
                        share in the event of a divorce.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> She further claims that Tik advised her to
                        deposit her money with Andy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and to ensure that there was no paper trail
                        to trace them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> According to Sarah, the Trust Money
                        represented her “savings and earnings from
                        conservative investments in
                            property”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Sarah paid the first tranche of the Trust Money
                        ($83,700) to Andy after he told her of an opportunity to
                        purchase a shop near the Shenyang China Bus and Railway
                        Terminal in China (“the Shenyang
                            Shop”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Sarah also claims that she consulted Tik on
                        the opportunity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Sarah alleges that $80,000 from the first
                        tranche was part of a 30% deposit for the Shenyang
                        Shop (the remainder was to be financed by a
                            loan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>). The balance was for administrative,
                        currency exchange commission and legal fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     The second tranche of the Trust Money comprised a sum
                        of $40,000 as the balance of the 30% deposit for the
                        Shenyang Shop and $5,000 for Andy’s travel
                            expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     The remaining tranches were for the balance of the
                        payment due for the Shenyang Shop, renovation and
                        business expenses for the Shenyang Shop and payment for
                        a parcel of land near an airport (“the Airport
                            Land”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Sarah claims that Andy had told her on
                        29 May 2005 that her application for a loan for the
                        balance of 70% of the purchase price of the Shenyang
                        Shop was unsuccessful and that she had to pay the
                        remainder in cash if she wanted to avoid the forfeiture
                        of the 30% deposit. Andy also told her that he
                        required $140,000 to renovate the Shenyang Shop and
                        commence business, and that the Airport Land was
                        available for purchase at $120,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> He explained that the Airport Land could be

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_g"></a>(g)     Both defendants were unjustly enriched because they

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Turning now to the Blackmail Money, Sarah claims that on
                    or around October 2008, Andy asked her for $100,000 to start
                    a new business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Despite telling Andy that she did not have any

                        <em>ie</em>, the Blackmail Money,

                    to help Andy start his business so that he could return the
                    Trust Money to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Apropos the Blackmail Money, Sarah claims that Andy is
                    liable in the tort of harassment and intimidation for his
                    conduct which resulted in Sarah’s payment of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Contract Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Contract Claims arise out of an agreement entered

                    2006 for the plaintiffs to invest in Tik’s business
                    (“the Agreement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The Agreement contemplated that the plaintiffs
                    would pay a sum of $79,000 to Tik as consideration for a 50%
                    share of her business in relation to apparel under the trade
                    and brand name “POLICE” (clause (a) of the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     Tik and the plaintiffs were to incorporate a company

                        relevant authorities (clause (b) of the Agreement). The
                        parties subsequently incorporated a company by the name
                        of “Sarah Design Pte Ltd” (“Sarah

                        the onus was on Sarah Design to arrange for the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     She did not breach clause (h) of the Agreement because
                        the onus was on Sarah Design to prepare fresh agreements
                        to be executed with the franchisees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     She did not breach clause (j) of the Agreement because
                        Sarah Design had taken over the “POLICE”
                        brand apparel and was trading with them. She asserts
                        that Sarah Design was supposed to appoint an auditor to
                        audit Tik’s business but this was not done. She
                        further claims that she was saddled with the debts of
                        her business which were to be taken over by Sarah
                        Design. She was ready, willing and able to transfer the
                        assets of the business but Sarah Design did not take any
                        steps to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     She did not breach clause (k) of the Agreement because
                        the manufacturer was continuing its supply. Sarah Design
                        did not place any orders with the manufacturer. Tik
                        claims that she had informed the manufacturer of the
                        “change in entity” and the manufacturer
                        was agreeable to continue the supply.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_e"></a>(e)     She did not breach an implied term that the apparel
                        supplied would be fit for the Singapore market because
                        the apparel came in various sizes. Tik denies that she
                        refused the plaintiffs’ request for various sizes
                        and asserts that such requests were not even made in the
                        first place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As for the claims in misrepresentation, Tik denies having
                    represented that the existing four outlets were doing well
                    and would not close down. She claims that she told the
                    plaintiffs that the franchisees might terminate their
                    agreements. Tik also claims that she would not have allowed
                    a takeover of her business if the franchisees were doing
                    well. She claims that the plaintiffs were aware of the
                    situation and were confident of turning around the
                        business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Tik further denies that she represented that she
                    would purchase the plaintiffs’ equity if they did not
                    wish to continue with the business. Tik points out that if
                    such a representation was made, the plaintiffs would have
                    requested for the sum of $80,000 much earlier because they
                    had stopped the “POLICE” business in 2007. No
                    requests were made until the commencement of this
                        action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In addition, Tik denies that the plaintiffs entered into
                    the Agreement by relying on the representations. She asserts
                    that the plaintiffs conducted their own due
                        diligence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> She also denies that the representations are
                        untrue<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> or that they were fraudulently made<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Tik also asserts that Sarah Design did not fulfil its
                    obligations and take steps to fulfil the conditions of the
                    Agreement. If there were any grievances, Sarah Design should
                    have commenced action to enforce its rights.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> Since Sarah Design has since been struck off
                    from the Registry of Companies, Tik argues that the
                    plaintiffs are trying to recover their losses from Tik even
                    though the losses resulted from Sarah Design’s failure
                    in the business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In relation to the Trust and Blackmail Claims, a threshold
                    factual issue is whether Sarah paid Andy the Trust Money and
                    the Blackmail Money as gifts. If the Trust Money and
                    Blackmail Money were paid to Andy as gifts, then all the
                    Trust and Blackmail Claims would fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     If the Trust Money and the Blackmail Money were not paid
                    as gifts, the following issues would arise for

                        certainty?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the Trust Money was held on an express trust, the
                        following subsidiary issues would arise:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_25-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       Did Andy breach the trust?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_25-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Is Andy liable for the Trust Money in unjust

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the Trust Money was <em>not</em> held on an express trust, it would
                        be necessary to consider whether there is nevertheless a
                        presumption that the Trust Money was held on a resulting
                        trust by Andy for the benefit of Sarah.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     If it is shown that the Trust Money was used for the
                        benefit of Conway Corporation, does it mean that Tik has
                        been unjustly enriched from the receipt of the Trust
                        Money?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_e"></a>(e)     Was the Blackmail Money paid to Andy as a result of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The issues arising in connection with the Agreement are as

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did Tik breach clauses (f), (h), (j) and (k) of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Trust and Blackmail Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Trust Money</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">A comment on the alternative claims of an express
                trust and a resulting trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As noted above, Sarah has relied on <em>both</em> an express trust and a resulting trust
                    (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). It is
                    well established that a resulting trust can arise in two
                    situations. In the first situation, a resulting trust will
                    arise if a person voluntarily pays money to or purchases
                    property for another person. The recipient will be presumed
                    to hold the money or property on a resulting trust for the
                    payer or purchaser. The second situation arises upon the
                    failure of an express trust to fully exhaust the beneficial
                    interest in the property. It would be useful to refer to
                    Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s exposition of the two types of
                    resulting trusts in <em>Westdeutsche
                        </em><em>Landesbank
                        </em><em>Girozentrale v Islington
                        London Borough Council</em> [1996] AC 669
                        (“<em>Westdeutsche</em>”) at 708 (cited by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye
                        Terence and another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108
                        (“<em>Lau Siew
                    Kim</em>”) at [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under existing law a resulting trust arises in two
                        sets of circumstances: (A) where A makes a voluntary
                        payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the
                        purchase of property which is vested either in B alone
                        or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption
                        that A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money or
                        property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole
                        provider of the money) or in the case of a joint
                        purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their
                        contributions. It is important to stress that this is
                        only a <em>presumption</em>,
                        which presumption is easily rebutted either by the
                        counter-presumption of advancement or by direct evidence
                        of A's intention to make an outright transfer:
                            see <em>Underhill and Hayton,
                            Law of Trusts and Trustees</em>, pp. 317
                        et seq.; <em>Vandervell v. Inland Revenue

                        288 et seq. (B) Where A transfers property to
                            B <em>on express
                            trusts</em>, but the trusts declared do not
                        exhaust the whole beneficial interest: ibid. and
                            <em>Quistclose Investments Ltd. v.
                            Rolls Razor Ltd (In
                        Liquidation)</em> [1970] A.C. 567. Both types
                        of resulting trust are traditionally regarded as
                        examples of trusts giving effect to the common intention
                        of the parties. A resulting trust is not imposed by law
                        against the intentions of the trustee (as is a
                        constructive trust) but gives effect to his presumed
                        intention. Megarry J. in <em>In re
                            Vandervell's Trusts (No. 2)</em> suggests that
                        a resulting trust of type (B) does not depend on
                        intention but operates automatically. I am not convinced
                        that this is right. If the settlor has expressly, or by
                        necessary implication, abandoned any beneficial interest
                        in the trust property, there is in my view no resulting
                        trust: the undisposed-of equitable interest vests in the
                        Crown as bona vacantia: see <em>In re

                    purchase of land and property in China. It appears,
                    therefore, that Sarah was seeking to rely on the second
                    category of resulting trusts according to the categorisation
                    in <em>Westdeutsche</em>. In
                    particular, it appears that Sarah is relying on a
                        “<em>Quistclose</em>
                    trust” (<em>ie</em>, the trust
                    which was found to have arisen in <em>Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments
                        Ltd</em> [1970] AC 567). On one view, at least, a
                        <em>Quistclose</em> trust may be
                    rationalised as a resulting trust arising from a failure to
                    exhaust the transferor’s beneficial interest because,
                    in a <em>Quistclose</em> trust
                    situation, money is paid to the transferee for a specific
                    purpose (see <em>Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley and
                        others</em> [2002] 2 AC 164 at [100] (<em>per</em> Lord Millett, dissenting on other

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">100    As Sherlock Holmes reminded Dr Watson, when you
                            have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,
                            however improbable, must be the truth. I would
                            reject all the alternative analyses, which I find
                            unconvincing for the reasons I have endeavoured to
                            explain, and hold the <em>Quistclose</em> trust to be an <em>entirely orthodox example of the kind
                                of default trust known as a resulting trust. The
                                lender pays the money to the borrower by
                                way of loan, but he does not part with the
                                entire beneficial interest in the money, and in
                                so far as he does not it is held on a resulting
                                trust for the lender from the outset.</em>
                            Contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeal, it
                            is the borrower who has a very limited use of the
                            money, being obliged to apply it for the stated
                            purpose or return it. He has no beneficial interest
                            in the money, which remains throughout in the lender
                            subject only to the borrower's power or duty to
                            apply the money in accordance with the lender's
                            instructions. <em>When the purpose
                                fails, the money is returnable to the lender,
                                not under some new trust in his favour which
                                only comes into being on the failure of the
                                purpose, but because the resulting trust in his
                                favour is no longer subject to any power on the
                                part of the borrower to make use of the
                                money.</em> Whether the borrower is
                            obliged to apply the money for the stated purpose or
                            merely at liberty to do so, and whether the lender
                            can countermand the borrower's mandate while it is
                            still capable of being carried out, must depend on
                            the circumstances of the particular case. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that a <em>Quistclose</em> trust does not only arise in a
                    situation where money was paid as a <em>loan</em> for a specific purpose (see the
                    decision of the High Court in <em>Singapore
                        Tourism Board v Children's Media Ltd and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, in Sarah’s opening statement, reference was
                    made to case law on the first category of resulting trusts,
                        <em>viz</em>, the resulting trust
                    that is presumed to arise due to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, a voluntary payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The plaintiffs’ closing submissions also
                    refer to the first category.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> I am willing to accept that the first category
                    of resulting trusts need not be specifically pleaded because
                    it is a rebuttable presumption of law that arises due to
                    certain circumstances (see <em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> at [46]). The underlying circumstances giving
                    rise to the presumption of resulting trust must of course be
                    pleaded because they are material facts. Having said that, I
                    entertained some doubt as to whether it is open to parties
                    to rely on an express trust as a primary case and a
                    presumption of a resulting trust in the alternative. The
                    basis of the presumption of a resulting trust is the
                    “common-sense presumption that, outside of certain
                    relationships, an owner of property never intends to make a
                    gift…” (see <em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> at [36]). In contrast, an express trust is
                    premised on an <em>actual</em>
                    intention to convey property on trust (see <em>Snell’s Equity</em> (John McGhee QC
                    gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2010) at paras
                    21–019 to 21–020):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>(a) </em>
<em>Express trust.</em> An express trust is
                        created by the <b><em>actual

                        property is vested, as where A declares himself a
                        trustee of Whiteacre for B, or conveys it to C on trust
                        for B. The intention may be apparent from the express
                        use of the words “trust” in the relevant
                        instrument or gathered by inference from A’s words

                        whether A intends B to have the beneficial interest in
                        it, then B may hold the property on resulting trust for
                        A. The trust arises by operation of law to give effect
                        to a presumption that A did not intend B to take the

                    4 SLR 427 (“<em>Lin
                        Chao-Feng</em>”) and submitted that it is
                    indeed possible for a resulting trust to arise even if an
                    express trust is being mounted as the primary
                        claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> In <em>Lin Chao-Feng</em>,
                    the plaintiff claimed that shares held in the name of the
                    defendant were held on an <em>express</em> trust for him. Although this was not
                    specifically pleaded in his statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff also sought to argue that the shares were held on
                    a resulting trust. The High Court held that the plaintiff
                    was entitled to put forward an alternative case of a
                    resulting trust (see <em>Lin
                        Chao-Feng</em> at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15     Having considered
                        paras 4 and 5 of the statement of claim, <em>I have come to the conclusion that the
                            plaintiff is entitled to put forward an express
                            trust and, in the alternative, a resulting
                            trust</em>. It is a basic principle of
                        pleading that facts not law have to be pleaded and once
                        the material facts have been averred, the legal
                        consequences of the same can be developed in
                        submissions. This means that in order for the plaintiff
                        to argue that there was a resulting trust he must plead
                        the necessary factual ingredients on which a legal
                        submission of resulting trust can be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It does not appear from the report of the decision that it
                    was argued that the alternative case of a resulting trust
                    could not be maintained because it was logically
                    inconsistent with the primary case of an express trust. The
                    holding at [15]
                    of <em>Lin Chao-Feng</em> was simply in
                    the context of an argument that the alternative case of a
                    resulting trust was not expressly pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     There is also an English case in which an express trust
                    was put forth as the primary case theory, with an
                    alternative case theory premised on resulting trust
                    analysis. In <em>Close Invoice Finance Ltd v
                        Abaowa</em> [2010] EWHC 1920 (“<em>Close Invoice Finance</em>”), an
                    intervener sought a declaration that she was the true
                    beneficial owner of property held in her daughter’s
                    name. She had two bases for her declaratory claim. She
                    primarily asserted that her daughter held the property on an
                    express trust for her due to a declaration of trust.
                    Alternatively, she claimed that a resulting trust arose
                    because of her provision of funds to pay for the deposit for
                    the purchase of the property and her contributions to
                    various expenses, including mortgage payments. The court
                    found that the claim for an express trust failed on the
                    evidence as well as non-compliance with s 53(1)(b) of
                    the Law of Property Act 1925 (c 20) (UK) (see <em>Close Invoice Finance</em> at [87]). However, on the
                    alternative claim, the court found that the intervener was
                    the beneficiary of a resulting trust in the amount of the
                    deposit that she paid for the property (see <em>Close Invoice Finance</em>
                        at [116]).
                    Again, no argument seems to have been made that a resulting
                    trust could not be sustained as an alternative claim where
                    the primary case is one of express trust. However, it would
                    also appear that the alternative bases mounted in <em>Close Invoice Finance</em> did not
                    involve taking inconsistent <em>factual</em> positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In my view, a resulting trust could not be mounted as an
                    alternative case where the primary case of an express trust
                    entails an inconsistent factual position. I find support for
                    this view in a recent authority on the possibility of
                    maintaining alternative and inconsistent causes of action.
                    The Court of Appeal in <em>Ng Chee Weng v Lim
                        Jit Ming Bryan and another</em> [2012] 1 SLR 457
                        (“<em>Ng Chee
                    Weng</em>”) considered the extent to which
                    parties may plead alternative and <em>inconsistent</em> claims in the context of an
                    application for leave to amend a statement of claim. The
                    case involved a dispute over dividends paid on shares held
                    by the respondent. The appellant claimed that the respondent
                    held those shares on trust for him. The procedural history
                    of the appeal was somewhat complicated. For present
                    purposes, however, it is sufficient to note that the
                    appellant had initially only claimed for the dividends paid
                    on those shares. He later sought to amend his statement of
                    claim to mount a primary case that a sum of $4.5m was due to
                    him on the basis of a settlement agreement that the parties
                    had concluded. He then sought to claim the dividends as an
                        <em>alternative</em> cause of
                    action if the court found that there was no settlement
                    agreement (see <em>Ng Chee Weng</em> at
                        [9]). The
                    respondent argued that the amendment was not permissible
                    because, <em>inter alia</em>, the two
                    causes of action were inconsistent. The court noted that the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) do not expressly consider whether
                    inconsistent alternatives may be pleaded (see <em>Ng Chee Weng</em> at [31]). After considering
                    the position at common law, the court concluded that our law
                    permits the pleading of alternative rights provided that the
                    alternatives do not go against common sense or justice (see
                        <em>Ng Chee Weng</em> at [35]–[36]). An illustration of
                    a situation where inconsistent causes of action would offend
                    common sense is “when the pleader has <em>actual knowledge</em> of which
                    alternative is true” (see <em>Ng Chee
                        Weng</em> at [37] [emphasis added]). A further
                    prerequisite to pleading alternatives is that the facts for
                    the alternative claims must not be mixed up and must be
                    separately stated (see <em>Ng Chee
                        Weng</em> at [39]). The following observation is

                            sense and justice represents the law in Singapore.
                            Indeed, in <em>Brailsford v
                                Tobie</em> (1888) 10 ALT 194 ("<em>Brailsford</em>"), it was held
                            that an exception to the general rule is that
                            alternative statements of fact are not permitted if
                            one statement or the other must, to the knowledge of
                            the pleader, be false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    This exception highlights the tension the law
                            faces in deciding whether or not to permit parties
                            to plead inconsistent causes of action in the
                            alternative. While the pleader should be free to
                            plead inconsistent causes of action in the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    Applying the above principles to the facts of the
                            present appeal, we are of the view that the approach
                            taken in <em>Chong
                                </em><em>Poh
                                Siew</em> is sound and that the
                            Appellant is not precluded from pleading the
                            inconsistent causes of action in the <em>alternative</em>, as long as the
                            facts are not mixed up and are stated separately in
                            order to demonstrate on what facts each alternative
                            relief is based.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the facts, the court found that it was permissible for
                    the appellant to plead the alternative causes of action. The
                    facts underlying each claim were separately pleaded (see
                        <em>Ng Chee Weng</em> at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Applying the principles in <em>Ng Chee
                        Weng</em> to the present case, I find that the
                    alternative bases pleaded by Sarah as regards the Trust
                    Money do not offend common sense because in either event,
                    Sarah is essentially relying on the same factual matrix that
                    the Trust Money was paid to Andy for the purpose of
                    investing in the Shenyang Shop and the Airport Land insofar
                    as the resulting trust that Sarah is pursuing is a <em>Quistclose</em> trust. As for the
                        <em>presumption</em> of a resulting
                    trust, although the factual basis for the presumption
                        (<em>viz</em>, the payment of the
                    Trust Money to Andy without any consideration in return) is
                    different from the basis for the express trust claim, the
                    factual bases are not inconsistent. In one sense it is
                    correct that Sarah is relying on <em>actual</em> knowledge of the reason why she paid
                    the Trust Money in support of her express trust claim which
                    may appear to be inconsistent with the alternative
                    presumption of a resulting trust claim which relies on a
                        <em>presumed</em> intention that
                    Andy was not to benefit from the Trust Money. However, these
                    alternative claims do not entail inconsistent factual
                    positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In any case, my view is not strictly essential to the
                    resolution of the present case. The threshold factual issue
                    as to the reason why Sarah paid Andy the Trust Money is
                    relevant to and determinative of both the express trust and
                    resulting trust claims. If the Trust Money was paid as a
                    gift, it would follow that Sarah could not have paid the
                    Trust Money on an express trust and, by the same token, any
                    presumption of a resulting trust would have been rebutted.
                    This issue would only be material if there was insufficient
                    evidence for me to make a finding on a balance of
                    probabilities as to whether the Trust Money was paid as a
                    gift. In that situation, the burden of proof would be
                    crucial. However, as will be seen below, there is sufficient
                    evidence for me to make a finding as to the purpose for
                    which the Trust Money was paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I turn now to consider Sarah’s primary case that the
                    Trust Money was paid to Andy on express trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the Trust Money paid to Andy on express
                trust?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Andy accepts that he did receive the Trust Money from
                    Sarah but claims that it was a gift to him on account of
                    their intimate relationship. It is significant to bear in
                    mind that the only competing case theory put forward by
                    Sarah was that the Trust Money was paid to Andy on express
                    trust for the purchase of the Shenyang Shop and the Airport
                    land. There is no alternative factual case that the Trust
                    Money was loaned to Andy. The starting point is to examine
                    the evidence adduced by Sarah in support of the express
                    trust. Typically one would expect some objective evidence to
                    support such a claim but none was adduced by Sarah. This is
                    all the more surprising given that Sarah is a financial
                    consultant and a real estate agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     First, Sarah has no documentary evidence whatsoever to
                    support her claim that the Trust Money was paid for the
                    purpose of purchasing properties in China. I note that Sarah
                    has explained that the reason why she did not have any
                    documentation to support the purchase of the properties was
                    because Tik had advised her to avoid documentation so that:
                    (a) her money would be safe with Andy; and (b) her
                    husband would not be able to trace the money without
                        documentation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> I do not accept her explanation. It does not
                    make sense for Sarah to allege that she did not want any
                    documentation to trace her approximately $600,000 investment
                    for the Shenyang Shop and the Airport Land because of her
                    concerns about her husband’s fidelity and yet she was
                    quite prepared to sign the Agreement in respect of the
                    “POLICE” brand of apparel for a significantly
                    smaller investment of $80,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, even if I were to accept Sarah’s
                    explanations for the lack of documentation, there was no
                    reason why she could not have <em>orally</em> obtained basic particulars of the
                    properties such as, for example, the address of the
                    properties and their land area. There was no reason for
                    Sarah to have been content with a general description of the
                    properties as “a shop near the Shenyang China Bus and
                    Railway Terminal” and “a piece of land near
                    the airport”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Third, the general and somewhat <em>vague</em> descriptions of the properties only
                    emerged at a late stage in these proceedings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Sarah filed her original statement of claim on
                        10 July 2009. It originally pleaded that the
                        Blackmail Money (<em>ie</em>,
                        $50,000) was part of the Trust Money used to purchase
                        land in China.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, Sarah did not provide
                        particulars of the land that was alleged to have been
                        purchased for her in China. She simply claimed that the
                        Trust Money and the Blackmail Money was given “to
                        purchase land and property in China”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     On 26 October 2009, Sarah obtained leave of the
                        court to amend the writ and the statement of claim. The
                        amendment to the writ was to include the second
                        plaintiff as a party to the action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> The amendments to the statement of claim
                        were to include the Contract Claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> Significantly, Sarah did not use this
                        opportunity to include particulars on the property that
                        was allegedly purchased with the Trust Money. The
                        Blackmail Money continued to be reflected as part of the
                        Trust Money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     Almost a year later, on 27 September 2010, the
                        plaintiffs obtained leave of the court to amend the
                        statement of claim for the second time. It was only on
                        this occasion that the plaintiffs pleaded that the Trust
                        Money was used to purchase the Shenyang Shop and the
                        Airport Land (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                            above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> The plaintiffs also removed the Blackmail
                        Money from the definition of the Trust Money<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> and made separate claims in respect of the
                        Blackmail Money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     If Sarah’s claim that the Trust Money was meant for
                    the purchase of the Shenyang Shop and Airport Land was true,
                    there was no reason for her not to have pleaded it at the
                    outset. It took her more than a year from the filing of her
                    original statement of claim to include those <em>vague</em> particulars which, if true,
                    must have been known to her from the very beginning of the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Accordingly, I find that Sarah has failed to prove her
                    primary case based on express trust as there is simply no
                    evidence to establish the alleged purpose of the payment. As
                    the alternative <em>Quistclose</em>
                    trust claim is premised on the same factual basis, <em>ie</em>, that the Trust Money was given
                    for the purpose of investing in the Shenyang Shop and the
                    Airport Land, it must follow that that resulting trust
                    likewise fails. I turn now to consider the evidence relating
                    to Andy’s case that the Trust Money was given to him
                    as a gift. This inquiry is relevant as regards Sarah’s
                    claim based on the <em>presumption</em>
                    of a resulting trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the Trust Money a gift to Andy?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Having considered all the evidence, I find on a balance of
                    probabilities that Sarah paid the Trust Money to Andy as a
                    gift. I elaborate below.</p>

                    to him in late 2008 and early 2009 which suggested that he

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     From the above SMS messages (particularly those which have
                    been italicised), it is clear that the relationship between
                    Sarah and Andy was more than an owner/contractor
                    relationship. The use of a term of endearment
                        “<em>Sorry dear</em>”
                    [emphasis added] is not consistent with Sarah’s
                    account of the nature of her relationship. The words
                        “<em>[j]ust find any man who will
                        give me 700k w no strings attach n I will say I love
                        u”, “I never said I love n I never love u
                        n don’t need yr love</em>”,
                        “<em>U can hate me. No diff. Love
                        me also harm me. May as well hate me”</em>
                    and “<em>Sori if I owe in the previous
                        life, will pay in my next life</em>”
                    [emphasis added] suggest that Sarah and Andy were having a
                    disagreement over the latter’s request for money which
                    led to Sarah saying that she never loved Andy. From her
                    response, it can be inferred that Andy was reminding Sarah
                    of her previous expressions of love. In another SMS message
                    of 23 January 2009, Sarah finally agreed to give Andy
                    $50,000 (which is the subject matter of the Blackmail Money
                    claim) “<em>on 1 condition. U r out of
                        my life completely forever</em>” [emphasis
                    added]. This is in itself a clear acknowledgment that Andy
                    was at one time in Sarah’s life. The tone of the
                    exchange does not strike me as consistent with a
                    disagreement between a contractor and a client or even a
                    disagreement between trusted friends but it is more
                    consistent with Sarah and Andy having shared a prior
                    relationship of some intimacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     There were calls and SMS messages from both the first and

                    Sarah. Sarah sought to recover the deleted SMS messages
                    which Andy had sent Sarah. Andy claimed that he had deleted
                    them because he felt “pain in [his] heart”
                    when he looked at the messages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> There were also some SMS messages from Sarah

                    messages from Andy’s mobile phone. On 7 July
                    2011, an expert retained by the plaintiffs was not able to
                    retrieve the deleted SMS messages because the screen of
                    Andy’s mobile phone was defective. The expert was able
                    to download the <em>existing</em> data
                    on the mobile phone (without the deleted data) onto a
                    “portable flash drive”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> Andy retained the portable flash drive and
                    refused to allow Sarah to keep a copy of this data. Andy was
                    then asked to repair the screen of his mobile phone. Sarah
                    agreed to pay for the costs of the repair after Andy had
                    requested her to do so. On 11 July 2011, Andy informed
                    Sarah that he had lost his mobile phone and had made a
                    police report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> Sarah then requested for a copy of the police
                    report as well as a copy of the portable flash drive. Andy
                    did not respond but during the hearing, Andy informed the
                    court that he had lost the portable flash drive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> Sarah invited the court to draw an adverse
                    inference that the deleted messages were sent by Andy
                    “to blackmail her for more money” and that the
                    “relationship between them was not one of lovers but
                    rather one of blackmailer and victim”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Although it would be useful to examine the deleted SMS
                    messages, the language adopted by Sarah in her SMS messages
                    is, in my view, more consistent with the existence of a
                    prior intimate relationship rather than that of a
                    blackmailer and victim. Further, I do not see how the
                    deleted messages would have changed the context or
                    interpretation of the messages that I have referred to above
                    (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>–<a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above). In any event, “the
                    portable flash drive” did not contain the deleted
                    messages (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In fact, one of the messages went further to suggest that
                    the Trust Money was a gift:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pls do not say I love u to me again. <em>Just find any man who will give me 700k w
                            no strings attach</em> n I will say I love u.
                        Do not make me angry. When I asked u to mortgage the
                        property to <em>loan</em> me the $,
                        u refused. So don’t I love u again w me. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this message, Sarah in effect was telling Andy that she
                    had given him the sum of $700,000 with “no strings
                    attached” and was referring to a previous occasion
                    when she had requested Andy to mortgage some property. There
                    was some dispute as to the identity of the property referred
                    to in this message. According to Andy, Sarah was referring
                    to some property that he had purchased in
                        Russia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> According to Sarah, the property she was
                    referring to was the Shenyang Shop.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> What is significant is that <em>on Sarah’s version</em>, she had asked for
                    the Shenyang Shop to be mortgaged and for the proceeds of
                    the mortgage to be <em>loaned</em> to
                    her. If indeed the Trust Money was paid to Andy on trust,
                    she would not have asked for the proceeds of the mortgage of
                    the property purchased with that money to be <em>loaned</em> to her. She would have been
                    fully entitled to simply demand that Andy pay her the entire
                    sale proceeds. It would also be incongruous for Sarah to
                    request Andy to mortgage property to loan money to her if
                    their relationship was not intimate or at least close. Of
                    course there is the all-important question as to why Sarah
                    would hand over a substantial sum in excess of $600,000 to
                    Andy, a contractor who she had recently met, to invest in
                    properties in China without any documentary evidence.
                    According to Sarah, she was under the “black
                    magic” spell of Tik.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> I find her explanation to be a contrived
                    afterthought in a hopeless attempt to distract from the
                    truth that she was engaged in an intimate relationship with
                    Andy. There is also no suggestion by Sarah that Tik received
                    any of the Trust Money. This becomes clearer when other
                    objective evidence is examined below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Bangkok Trip and the Malacca
                Trip</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Andy claimed to have had sexual intercourse with Sarah
                    during a trip to Bangkok, Thailand (“the Bangkok
                    Trip”) and Malacca, Malaysia (“the Malacca
                    Trip”) in March and April 2005,
                        respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In relation to the Bangkok Trip, Sarah referred to
                    inconsistencies in the affidavits filed by Andy in
                    interlocutory proceedings. In an affidavit dated
                    6 November 2009, Andy had deposed that he had stayed
                    overnight with Sarah on 10 March 2005 during the
                    Bangkok Trip.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> Sarah’s husband then deposed in an
                    affidavit that Sarah was with him on the two nights of the
                    Bangkok Trip.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> This led Andy to state in a further affidavit
                    dated 7 December 2009 that he recalled that Sarah did
                    not stay with him overnight on 10 March
                        2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> Sarah also pointed out that Andy was unable to
                    recall the name of the five-star hotel in which Andy alleged
                    that they had checked into together and that Andy did not
                    attempt to retrieve documentary evidence to support the fact
                    that they had checked into such a hotel even though Andy had
                    done so for another hotel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> Sarah further referred to her husband’s
                    evidence on the times at which he saw Sarah during the
                    Bangkok Trip which contradicted Andy’s version (in an
                    interlocutory affidavit) on the time when Sarah left him
                    during the two nights of the Bangkok Trip.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Sarah also denied Andy’s allegation that
                    she had paid for Andy’s hotel room during the Bangkok
                        Trip.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In my view, the undisputed evidence about what transpired
                    during the Bangkok Trip also suggests that Sarah and Andy
                    had a much closer relationship than what one would
                    ordinarily expect of a contractor and his client. Sarah does
                    not dispute having travelled to Bangkok with
                        Andy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> Although this was disputed by Andy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span>, she claims that Andy booked her air ticket to
                    Bangkok on her behalf.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> It was not disputed that Sarah informed Andy
                    that she was going to Bangkok to check on her husband,
                    although I should add that Andy’s purpose for going to
                    Bangkok was disputed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> There is also no dispute that Sarah used her
                    American International Assurance corporate credit card to
                    book Andy’s hotel room at Arnoma Hotel in
                        Bangkok.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> Why would Sarah have agreed to book the hotel
                    room with her credit card for her contractor and run the
                    risk that he might run up a huge bill? These undisputed
                    facts in relation to the Bangkok Trip are simply not
                    consistent with a relationship of a contractor and a client.
                    When viewed with the other objective evidence, in particular
                    the evidence of the Malacca Trip and the above SMS messages,
                    these undisputed facts appear more consistent with the
                    parties having an intimate relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I turn now to consider the differing accounts of the
                    Malacca Trip. Sarah initially denied having made the Malacca
                    Trip or having ever stayed at Hotel Grand Continental Melaka
                    in Malacca (“Hotel Grand Continental”) in an
                    affidavit she deposed to in support of her application for
                    summary judgment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> She exhibited a copy of all the endorsements on
                    her passport for the period between 11 February 2003
                    and 11 February 2008 and relied on an absence of any
                    stamp on her passport to demonstrate that she did not make
                    the Malacca Trip.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> This was, however, misleading because Sarah is a
                    Malaysian national and therefore her passport would not show
                    any stamps for her visits to Malaysia in any event. She
                    later admitted that she made the Malacca Trip, albeit that
                    she made the trip alone.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> She explained that she realised that she had
                    made the Malacca Trip after she made checks following
                    Andy’s production of a hotel invoice with her name as
                    the guest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Andy’s evidence on the Malacca Trip was that Sarah
                    had driven to the Genting Highlands casino resort to collect
                    some casino brochures so that she could tell her husband
                    that she had lost the money at the casino if her husband
                    were to ask about the money which she had decided to give to
                        Andy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> Andy was able to produce an invoice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> which, on its face, stated that two persons had
                    checked into a hotel room at Hotel Grand Continental
                    (“the Malacca Hotel Room Invoice”). He also
                    produced a hotel receipt for dinner at Hotel Grand
                    Continental (“the Dinner Invoice”) during the
                    trip. The Dinner Invoice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span>, again on its face, stated that two persons had
                    dinner. These invoices were exhibited in an interlocutory
                    affidavit that Andy had filed on <em>6 November 2009</em> in response to the
                    plaintiffs’ application for summary
                        judgment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Sarah testified that her husband would not have believed
                    that she lost money through gambling because Sarah’s
                    father had lost his fortune to gambling, which caused Sarah
                    to have an aversion to gambling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> Sarah also referred to her evidence that she was
                    physically incapable of driving to Genting Highlands and
                    then to Malacca because the trip “would have been far
                    too taxing for her”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> In this regard, Sarah referred to an
                    inconsistency in Andy’s account of the person who
                    drove during the Malacca Trip. Andy’s evidence in his
                    AEIC was that the person who drove the car was
                        Sarah.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> However, in his opening statement, Andy took the
                    position that he took turns with Sarah to drive during the
                    Malacca Trip.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I accept Andy’s version of what transpired during
                    the Malacca Trip. Andy’s version was corroborated by
                    objective evidence, <em>viz</em>, the
                    Malacca Hotel Room Invoice and the Dinner Invoice. I am not
                    satisfied with Sarah’s explanation for the invoices.
                    Despite having advance notice of these invoices since late
                    2009, in her AEIC, which was affirmed on <em>24 May 2011</em>, Sarah did not provide any
                    explanation for these invoices. It was only in her
                    supplementary AEIC, which was affirmed on 8 July 2011,
                    that Sarah deposed that she had obtained confirmation from
                    one Ms Audrey Lim from Hotel Grand Continental that she had
                    checked into the hotel room by herself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> Sarah referred to a letter from Ms Audrey
                        Lim<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span>, which she claimed demonstrated that she was at
                    the hotel alone.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> According to Sarah, this letter was admissible
                    under s 32(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997
                    Rev Ed) notwithstanding that the manager was not called as a
                        witness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> Her solicitors attempted to ask Ms Audrey Lim to
                    testify as a witness at this trial which was originally
                    scheduled from 11 to 20 July 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span> Ms Audrey Lim responded that she was unable to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I am not satisfied that Ms Audrey Lim’s attendance
                    could not be procured without an unreasonable amount of
                    delay or expense. As alluded to above (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>), after sitting for a day,
                    the first tranche of the trial was vacated due to an
                    unforeseen health problem involving Tik’s lead
                    counsel. Sarah did not produce any documentary evidence of
                    her attempts to contact Ms Audrey Lim to attend the resumed
                    trial of this matter. She merely told the court that she had
                    called Ms Audrey Lim who had told her that she had left
                    Hotel Grand Continental.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> In any case, even if the letter was admissible,
                    it was of little use because it was inherently ambiguous.
                    The letter, so far as material, states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is to certify that [Sarah] have [<em>sic</em>] made a booking with us in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was not clear to me if the words “1 person

                    Sarah had made a booking for a room in which only one person
                    was entitled to check-in. This difference in potential
                    meaning is material because, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>, Andy has also produced
                    an invoice from Hotel Grand Continental, <em>viz</em>, the Malacca Hotel Room Invoice, which
                    stated that two persons had checked-into the hotel room. Ms
                    Audrey Lim’s letter did not also attempt to explain
                    why the Malacca Hotel Room Invoice stated that two persons
                    had checked-into the hotel room. Since Ms Audrey Lim’s
                    letter did not unequivocally state that Sarah checked-into
                    the hotel room by herself and did not explain the Malacca
                    Hotel Room Invoice, I would not have placed much weight on
                    her letter even if it was admissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Turning to the Dinner Invoice, Sarah did not provide any
                    explanation for this invoice in her AEIC despite having had
                    notice of the invoice since 6 November 2009 (see
                        <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above). It was
                    only in her responses to questions during cross-examination
                    by Tik’s counsel that Sarah came up with an
                    explanation that she had dinner with a Malay gentleman to
                    discuss the development of some land in Pengerang, Malaysia
                    for a driving range.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> I do not accept her belated explanation because
                    no satisfactory reason was offered to explain her failure to
                    depose to this alleged dinner with the Malay gentleman in
                    her AEIC. Her only explanation for the delay was that, even
                    at the time of her testimony in court, she was not sure who
                    she was dining with:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In fact, her response shows that she was not even sure if
                    she had dinner with the Malay gentleman and hence was not in
                    a position to contradict Andy’s evidence that she had
                    dinner with him. In my view, this explanation was concocted
                    by Sarah when she was cornered with clear objective evidence
                    that she was not alone for the Malacca Trip as she had
                    claimed. The inference is that Sarah was with Andy for the
                    Malacca Trip. How else would Andy have come into possession
                    of the Malacca Hotel Room Invoice and the Dinner Invoice?
                    According to Sarah, she claimed that Andy must have removed
                    the Malacca Hotel Room Invoice and the Dinner Invoice from
                    her car when she gave him a lift.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> This was yet another fallacious explanation by
                    Sarah. This inference is further supported by her initial
                    denial of the Malacca Trip altogether and her misleading
                    reliance on the absence of entry stamps in her passport (see
                        <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Finally there is undisputed evidence that on the morning
                    of 16 April 2005, the first day of the Malacca Trip,
                    Sarah sent Andy two SMS messages at 6.42am and at 7.36am
                    respectively. The parties disputed the reason for the
                    messages. According to Andy, the message at 6.42am was a
                    wake-up call from Sarah<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> while the message at 7.36am was to inform him
                    that she was waiting to pick up Andy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> Sarah, however, claims that the messages were to
                    inform him that she was leaving for Malaysia and for him to
                    keep an eye on her husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> Sending SMS messages at such an early hour even
                    if for the purpose of asking Andy to check on her husband is
                    entirely inconsistent with an owner/contractor relationship.
                    On balance, I find that the SMS messages sent by Sarah on
                    the morning of 16 April 2005 were for the purpose of
                    arranging the pick up for the Malacca Trip. This further
                    corroborates Andy’s evidence that he was with Sarah
                    for the Malacca Trip.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Evidence suggesting that Sarah did not
                pay for some renovations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Andy testified that he started an intimate relationship
                    with Sarah after she retained him to conduct works or
                    renovations for her at an apartment at Balestier Road
                    (“the Balestier Road Apartment”) and at her
                    apartment at Dairy Farm Estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span> As evidence of their intimacy, Andy claimed that
                    he did not charge Sarah for the works or renovations at the
                    Balestier Road Apartment and for another apartment at the
                    Castle Green Condominium which belonged to Sarah’s
                    client (“the Castle Green
                        Apartment”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> Andy was able to produce a torn cheque
                    (“the Torn Cheque”) issued by Sarah as
                    evidence that he did not collect any payment for his work on
                    the Balestier Road Apartment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Sarah offered a different account for the Torn Cheque. She
                    claimed that she paid Andy in cash for the renovations at
                    the Balestier Apartment at his request because he wanted to
                    pay his workers who were going back to Malaysia for the
                    Chinese New Year holidays.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> She claimed that Andy tore the Torn Cheque in
                    her presence after she handed him the cash
                        payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As for the Castle Green Apartment, Sarah was able to
                    produce an invoice apparently issued by Bumi Megah which she
                    claimed was evidence that she had paid for the
                        renovations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> Andy’s explanation for this invoice was
                    that he had given Sarah blank Bumi Megah invoices for her to
                    render invoices to her own client even though Sarah did not
                    actually pay Andy for it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span> It cannot be gainsaid that Andy did provide the
                    blank invoices to Sarah since Sarah admitted that the
                    handwriting on the invoice was indeed hers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> She claims that it was given to her in blank
                    because Andy’s written English was poor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> However, it is clear from the evidence that Andy
                    could write simple English as he had written out a cheque
                    for Sarah.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> Such an arrangement is again not consistent with
                    an owner/contractor relationship. It has to be much more. In
                    this regard, Andy also called his sister (<em>ie</em>, Ms Pang) as a witness who testified that
                    it was Andy who paid for the renovations at the Castle Green
                    Apartment because Ms Pang had to account for the renovations
                    to her husband (apparently, her husband owned Bumi Megah,
                    although Andy was also a partner in the business for some
                        time).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Sarah further argued that Andy lied when he claimed in
                    court that the invoice was forged, in support of which he
                    produced <em>another</em> invoice with
                    the words “supply main door castle” written on
                    it to attempt to show that Sarah had doctored the invoice
                    that she produced.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> It later turned out that Andy’s version of
                    the invoice was not the version that was exhibited in an
                    interlocutory affidavit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span> Andy then admitted that the additional words on
                    his version of the invoice were added <em>by
                        himself</em> during a discussion with his previous
                    solicitor in November 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span> Sarah submitted that Andy’s explanation
                    was incredible and suggested that he was either untruthful
                    or had a bad memory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In my view, the Torn Cheque was objective evidence in
                    support of Andy’s claim that he did not charge Sarah
                    for the Balestier Road Apartment renovations. Sarah’s
                    explanation for the Torn Cheque was not credible. It does
                    not make sense for Sarah to have taken the effort to arrange
                    for cash for Andy’s needs if he was just a contractor
                    to her. As Andy had submitted, if Andy needed cash, he could
                    have queued up at a bank to cash the cheque.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, as Andy also submitted, there was
                    no documentary evidence to support the cash payment. No
                    receipt for the payment was produced. I would also observe
                    that if Andy was just a contractor to Sarah, she would have
                    taken back the cheque for cancellation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The evidence of non-party
                witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Sarah did not challenge the evidence of non-party
                    witnesses, <em>viz</em>, Ms Pang
                    and Mr Peter Poh (“Mr Poh”), Tik’s
                    former husband, on the nature of Sarah’s relationship
                    with Andy. Ms Pang had testified that she was aware that
                    Sarah and her brother, Andy, were having an
                        affair.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_155" id="Ftn_155_1"><sup>[note: 155]</sup></a></span> This aspect of Ms Pang’s evidence was
                    never challenged. Similarly, in his answers to questions by
                    Sarah during cross-examination, Mr Poh referred to Andy
                    as Sarah’s “boyfriend”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a></span> Mr Poh went further to suggest that Sarah
                    had “given” Andy $800,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_157" id="Ftn_157_1"><sup>[note: 157]</sup></a></span> and that he (<em>ie</em>,
                    Mr Poh) felt that this was a “high price for the
                        [<em>ie</em>, Andy’s]
                        love”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_158" id="Ftn_158_1"><sup>[note: 158]</sup></a></span>. Sarah did not also challenge this
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As the plaintiffs have submitted in their reply
                        submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a></span>, I accept that the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 is not a
                    “rigid or technical rule” (see <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United
                        Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R)
                        292<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_160" id="Ftn_160_1"><sup>[note: 160]</sup></a></span> (“<em>Hong
                        Leong</em>”) at [42]). A litigant is not
                    required to put every aspect of his case to the witness.
                    Only matters that are critical to his case have to be put
                    (see <em>Hong Leong</em> at [42]). A litigant also
                    need not put his case if the witness had clear notice that
                    the issue is disputed (see <em>Kwee Seng Chio
                        Peter v Biogenics </em><em>Sdn
                        </em><em>Bhd</em> [2003] 2
                    SLR(R) 482 at [21]).
                    Turning to the facts of this case, the nature of
                    Sarah’s relationship with Andy is a critical matter
                    that is decisive of a major part of her case (<em>ie</em>, her claims for the Trust Money).
                    Hence, Sarah’s version of her relationship ought to
                    have been put to Ms Pang and Mr Poh. On the other
                    hand, it was clear from the plaintiffs’ pleadings that
                    Andy’s allegation of an intimate relationship was
                    disputed. I consider this to be sufficient notice to the
                    defendants and their witnesses. In the circumstances, I do
                    not attach much weight to Sarah’s failure to challenge
                    Ms Pang’s and Mr Poh’s evidence on the
                    nature of the relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     However, even though I accept that the unchallenged
                    evidence of Ms Pang and Mr Poh was not <em>per se</em> fatal to Sarah’s case,
                    it still leaves me to consider the weight of their evidence.
                    Admittedly, Ms Pang was not entirely disinterested given her
                    familial ties to Andy. However, Mr Poh was Tik’s
                        <em>former</em> husband. Ms Pang
                    gave unchallenged evidence that Sarah went to visit her to
                    persuade Andy to return to Singapore so that she could
                    assist him financially.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_161" id="Ftn_161_1"><sup>[note: 161]</sup></a></span> There is no suggestion and, in any case, there

                    accept their testimony which I find to be entirely
                    consistent with the objective evidence that Sarah and Andy

                    Sarah’s application for summary judgment. In that
                    affidavit, Andy deposed as follows at para 18:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_164" id="Ftn_164_1"><sup>[note: 164]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When I was in China, [Sarah] intimated to me that she
                        had had a breast implant and I did notice the
                        enlargement upon meeting her when I returned from
                        China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Significantly, in her affidavit in reply to this
                    affidavit, Sarah stated as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_165" id="Ftn_165_1"><sup>[note: 165]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>At paragraphs 14 to 19</em>
                        of [Andy’s] Affidavit, [Andy] sets out various
                        facts about me to show that he was having an affair with
                        me. Knowing these facts about me did not show that I was
                        having an affair with him. <em>We were
                            friends and talked on occasions</em>. Indeed,
                        it was our friendship which made me trust [Andy] enough
                        to hand over the Trust Money to him for him to invest on
                        my behalf. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this paragraph of her affidavit, which referred,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, to para 18 of
                    Andy’s affidavit of 6 November 2009, Sarah was
                    suggesting that <em>she did inform
                        Andy</em> of the fact that she had a breast
                    implant because he was her friend. In my view, such a
                    disclosure of her breast implant is simply inconsistent with
                    a relationship that one would ordinarily expect of a
                    contractor and his client or even platonic friends who
                    “talked on occasions”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     For completeness, I should say that Sarah suggested a
                    different explanation during cross-examination as regards
                    Andy’s knowledge of her breast implant. Sarah seemed
                    to suggest during cross-examination that Andy knew of this
                    fact through Tik:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_166" id="Ftn_166_1"><sup>[note: 166]</sup></a></span></p>

                                [<em>ie</em>, the breast
                            implant]?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your Honour, I don’t know how he get

                            because Tik knew about it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">I can only say that this explanation was completely
                    different from the explanation that Sarah offered in her
                    affidavit in reply to Andy’s affidavit of
                    6 November 2009 (see <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In preferring Andy’s evidence, I accept that there
                    are some inconsistencies in his account of his relationship
                    with Sarah: (a) the first time that he had sexual
                    intercourse with Sarah; (b) the details of his contact with
                    Sarah during the Bangkok Trip; and (c) the identity of the
                    person who drove the car during the Malacca Trip. I am,
                    however, willing to accept that these inconsistencies were
                    due to the imperfections of human memory and the passage of
                    time. They do not, in any event, alter the body of objective
                    evidence that the relationship between Andy and Sarah was
                    anything but platonic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In this regard, I note the cautionary observation by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Ng Chee Chuan v Ng Ai
                        Tee (administratrix of the estate of Yap Yoon Moi,

                    on the dangers of making findings of fact on the basis of
                    the credibility of witnesses, particularly in relation to
                    events which occurred some years ago (at [16]–[17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    While it is no doubt necessary to ascertain the
                            credibility of witnesses in most cases where the
                            oral evidence of the parties conflict, <em>it is not always appropriate to rely
                                primarily on credibility (determined on the
                                basis of inconsistent testimony) as a basis for
                                drawing factual inferences, especially where the
                                events in question have taken place many years
                                ago and there are undisputed objective
                                facts</em>. <em>Imperfect
                                memories and uncertain recollections should not
                                necessarily be treated as impinging on the
                                credibility of a witness. These are but
                                afflictions which the passage of time will, in
                                varying degrees, bring to bear on all
                                individuals</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    
              <em>In this case, the question of
                                the credibility of witnesses should have played
                                a smaller role in the overall assessment as to
                                where the truth lay given the presence of
                                contemporaneous documents and undisputed
                                facts</em>. The trial judge, in our view,
                            should have drawn inferences from these pieces of
                                <em>objective evidence</em>
                            instead of reaching conclusions influenced heavily
                            by what was believed to be the credibility of the

                                facts.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Given the passage of time, it would, in my view, have been
                    actually somewhat unusual for Andy to have distinctly
                    recalled fine details of what happened in his relationship
                    in 2005. In the final analysis, I place more weight on the
                    objective evidence, particularly the SMS messages and the
                    Bangkok and Malacca Trips from which a reasonable inference
                    could be drawn that Sarah and Andy were engaged in an
                    intimate relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     For all the above reasons, I find on a balance of
                    probabilities that the Trust Money was given to Andy as a
                    gift because of his relationship with Sarah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relevance of Conway</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In view of my conclusion that the Trust Money was a gift,
                    it is not necessary for me to address the multitude of
                    further issues that would have arisen had I held that the
                    Trust Money was paid on trust. Nevertheless, I should make
                    some observations on one aspect of Sarah’s claim,
                        <em>viz</em>, her allegations in
                    relation to Conway, in the light of the emphasis that she
                    has placed on the defendants’ involvement in
                    Conway.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In her pleadings, Sarah claimed that the defendants
                    breached the trust over the Trust Money by using it for the
                    benefit of Conway.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_167" id="Ftn_167_1"><sup>[note: 167]</sup></a></span> She also claims that by misapplying the Trust
                    Money for the benefit of Conway, Tik has either knowingly
                    assisted in the breach of trust and/or knowingly received
                    monies in breach of trust.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_168" id="Ftn_168_1"><sup>[note: 168]</sup></a></span> Conway also features in Sarah’s claims in
                    resulting trust<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_169" id="Ftn_169_1"><sup>[note: 169]</sup></a></span>, conspiracy<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_170" id="Ftn_170_1"><sup>[note: 170]</sup></a></span> and restitution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_171" id="Ftn_171_1"><sup>[note: 171]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In the first place, Sarah has not even come close to
                    establishing on the evidence how the Trust Money, which was
                    paid in 2005, had any relation to Conway, which was only
                    incorporated on 23 February 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_172" id="Ftn_172_1"><sup>[note: 172]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, I do not see what value Conway adds
                    to Sarah’s claim for breach of trust and in her claim
                    in resulting trust. If she was able to establish that the
                    Trust Money was held on either an express trust or a
                    resulting trust, Andy’s failure to account for the
                    Trust Money would have, without more, entitled her to the
                    Trust Money.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Blackmail Money</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I also find on a balance of probabilities that the
                    Blackmail Money was paid as a gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Sarah’s evidence was that on or around
                    15 January 2009, Andy demanded to see Sarah’s
                        husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_173" id="Ftn_173_1"><sup>[note: 173]</sup></a></span> According to her, he also threatened to tell
                    Sarah’s husband that she was having an affair with him
                    and that she had given him the Trust Money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_174" id="Ftn_174_1"><sup>[note: 174]</sup></a></span> On Tik’s advice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_175" id="Ftn_175_1"><sup>[note: 175]</sup></a></span>, Sarah met Andy on or around 17 January
                    2009 to discuss his demands.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_176" id="Ftn_176_1"><sup>[note: 176]</sup></a></span> In response to Andy’s request for money,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The SMS messages are indicative that Andy was using his
                    past relationship to pester Sarah for financial assistance.
                    The only SMS message that is suggestive that Sarah may have
                    received some form of “threat” from Andy was
                    the following SMS message sent by Sarah:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I lost so much $ n each day I work hard. I ask no one
                        to pity me. Not even my family. They wonder why I so
                        rich n yet work so hard. Yet u can be lazy for the last
                        3 years. <em>Now can come blackmail
                            me</em>. <em>This is blackmail
                            in case yr English so poor</em>. Pls think thr
                        this whole night n ask yourself whether u doing the
                        right thing. Tomorrow go waterloo quan yin n ask goddess
                        if u doing the right thing. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Sarah appeared to be telling Andy that he was in
                    fact “blackmailing” her, the tone of her
                    response in the above message (and in the messages before
                    and after the above message) did not indicate to me that she
                    was in any way threatened. She described him as
                        “<em>lazy</em>”, a
                        “<em>paria dog</em>”,
                        “<em>low class</em>”
                    and criticised his “<em>poor</em>” English [emphasis added]. She
                    agreed to pay for the cost of an air ticket and nothing
                    more. This is hardly language one would use in response to a
                    “blackmailer”. Sarah appeared to be annoyed
                    with Andy’s repeated requests for money. There is no
                    factual basis for me to make a finding that Andy had
                    threatened Sarah to extract money from her. Neither do I
                    think that I should draw an adverse inference against Andy
                    due to the circumstances under which he allegedly lost his
                    mobile phone and the portable flash drive (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above). In my view, it is
                    possible to infer from the SMS messages that Sarah
                    eventually agreed albeit reluctantly to assist Andy. This is
                    borne out in her SMS message of 23 January 2009 when
                    she agreed to give him the $50,000 on condition that
                        “<em>U r out of my life completely
                        forever</em>” [emphasis added] as well her
                    further SMS message on the day when Sarah paid Andy the
                    Blackmail Money<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_187" id="Ftn_187_1"><sup>[note: 187]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Will help u. Meet u at 11 am.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At best, the language of the SMS messages might be
                    suggestive of some form of <em>emotional
                        blackmail</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     There is also other evidence to suggest that the threat
                    was not the reason for Sarah’s payment of the
                    Blackmail Money. Sarah filed a police report on 9 April
                    2009 (“the Police Report”). This was filed
                    almost three months after the alleged extortion. The Police
                    Report mentions that Sarah and her family were
                        threatened:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_188" id="Ftn_188_1"><sup>[note: 188]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On January 22 2009 I received a sms from [Andy] that
                        he needs S$100000/- from me. [Andy] had done contract
                        jobs at my house in year 2005. During that time he had
                        introduced me to a fortune teller namely [Tik]. [Tik]
                        then informed me that my husband is having affair
                            [<em>sic</em>]. After hearing
                        that I lost trust in my husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During then I sold one shop belonging to both my
                        husband and me and I gave the amount of $600000 I got
                        from the sale to [Andy] as I did not want my husband to
                        know where I keep the money. [Andy] informed me that he
                        will invest the money in China to buy a restaurant and
                        land on behalf of me. However, later he informed me that
                        he got cheated of the money and he will try to repay me
                        back. But until now he has not repaid back.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Due to the previous incidents with him I refused to
                        give the S$100000/- but <em>he threatened
                            me to watch out and he further tell me that he will
                            come to my house and cause trouble in my
                            family</em>. As I did not know what to do, I
                        seek advise from [Tik] who told me to give S$50000/- to
                        [Andy] to pacify him first. Listening to that advise I
                        gave him the money but [Andy] continued to ask me for
                        the remaining S$50000/-. I got suspicious of both [Andy]
                        and [Tik] and decided to do my personal investigations
                        and I managed to find out that both [Andy] and [Tik] are
                        conspiring together to get money from me. As such I am
                        lodging this report for police [<em>sic</em>] to look into the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, on 14 July 2010, Sarah filed another report
                    with the Commercial Affairs Division (“CAD”)
                    which stated as follows (“the CAD
                        Report”):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_189" id="Ftn_189_1"><sup>[note: 189]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In furtherance to the police report that I lodged
                        against the two defendants [<em>ie</em>, the Police Report], I have fresh
                        evidence from my civil litigation with them vide Suit
                        No. 589 of 2009/E. to suggest that the two defendants
                        had all along planned and cheated me of my funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Through my own checking I found out that they had
                        started a Cabaret Nightclub business in the name of
                        Conway Corporation Pte Ltd located at 30 Maxwell Road,
                        Singapore 069114, with a start-up capital of S$50,000/-,
                        which I believed [<em>sic</em>] is
                        from my monies taken from me by [Andy] on 23 Jan 2009.
                            <em>I gave him this money in cash as
                            he claimed that he needs it to jump start his

                            amounting more than S$600,000/-.</em> However,
                        after three months of business the nightclub business
                        was terminated. [Tik] claimed that the club was
                        supported by financial contribution from well wishes

                        contributed S$100,000/-. In addition one Raymond Lim
                        contributed S$100,000/- for renovation. This Raymond Lim

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I suspect that they do not have the intention to run
                        the business long term as they knew for a fact that the
                        liquor licence would not be approved. [Andy] only
                        applied for the liquor licence [on] 16 Apr 2009, after
                        they had operated for two weeks. This is evidence
                            [<em>sic</em>] in their
                        company’s bank account statement which indicated
                        credit card transaction incurred from 7 Apr 2009. In
                        fact they continued to operate till 30 Apr 2009. I also
                        noticed from the statement of account that there were
                        many cash cheque withdrawals made from the account until
                        finally there’s no [<em>sic</em>] much cash and the business closed
                        down in May 2009.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the CAD Report referred to the Police Report
                    which mentions that threats were made, it clearly states
                    that the reason why Sarah paid the Blackmail Money was to
                    help Andy in his business so that he would eventually be
                    able to pay her back the Trust Money. The threats that she
                    had earlier complained of were not mentioned as the reason
                    for her payment of the Blackmail Money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     For completeness, I should mention that Sarah was
                    cross-examined by Tik’s counsel on the differences in
                    the two reports. Sarah’s explanation was that the CAD
                    drafted the CAD Report for her and she agreed that it was
                    correct because Tik had told her that if she gave Andy the
                    Blackmail Money, it would help him to “jump
                    start” his business and repay Sarah the Trust
                        Money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_190" id="Ftn_190_1"><sup>[note: 190]</sup></a></span> Sarah told the CAD that the CAD Report did not
                    mention that she was harassed and threatened.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_191" id="Ftn_191_1"><sup>[note: 191]</sup></a></span> The CAD informed her that the beginning of the
                    CAD Report already referred to the earlier Police
                        Report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_192" id="Ftn_192_1"><sup>[note: 192]</sup></a></span> While it is true that the CAD Report referred to
                    the Police Report, the CAD Report explicitly stated that the
                    reason why the Blackmail Money was paid was that she wanted
                    to help Andy in his business so that he could repay her the
                    Trust Money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I should also say that the fact that the statement of
                    claim initially pleaded that the Blackmail Money was a part
                    of the Trust Money undermined her case on the Blackmail
                    Money. As noted above, it was only after <em>more than a year</em> after the action had
                    commenced that Sarah finally removed the Blackmail Money
                    from the definition of the Trust Money (see [39(c)] above).
                    If the Blackmail Money had indeed been truly paid as a
                    result of Andy’s threats and harassment, it would have
                    been obvious from the very outset that the Blackmail Money
                    could not be claimed as part of the Trust Money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     For the reasons stated above, I find that Sarah gave the
                    Blackmail Money as a gift to assist him financially.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The claims against Andy for the Trust Money fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In the light of my finding that the Trust Money was paid
                    as a gift to Andy, the claims against Tik for the Trust
                    Money must likewise fail. Sarah’s claims against Tik
                    for conspiracy, dishonest assistance, knowing receipt and in
                    constructive trust are all premised on Sarah having paid the
                    Trust Money to Andy on either express or resulting
                    trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Similarly, the claims for the Blackmail Money fail in view
                    of my finding that the money was also paid as a gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Contract Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did Tik breach clauses (f), (h), (j) and (k) of
                the Agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I find that Tik breached clause (f) of the Agreement.
                    Clause (f) imposed an obligation on Tik to transfer all her
                    rights and benefits acquired in relation to the trade and
                    brand name “POLICE” with effect from
                    1 June 2006. Tik admitted during her re-examination
                    that she did not comply with her obligation under that
                    clause to transfer her rights in relation to the brand name
                        “POLICE”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_193" id="Ftn_193_1"><sup>[note: 193]</sup></a></span> Her defence was that neither Mr Poh nor Sarah
                    had asked her to execute any agreements to implement such a
                    transfer. In her AEIC, Tik maintained that Sarah Design was
                    to arrange for all the documentation in relation to the
                    terms of the Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_194" id="Ftn_194_1"><sup>[note: 194]</sup></a></span> She said that she was ready, willing and able to
                    execute any necessary agreements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_195" id="Ftn_195_1"><sup>[note: 195]</sup></a></span> However, neither Mr Poh nor Sarah asked her
                    to execute any documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_196" id="Ftn_196_1"><sup>[note: 196]</sup></a></span> Tik’s assertion that she was willing to
                    execute the necessary agreements was not an excuse for her
                    breach because on a plain reading of clause (f), the onus
                    was on her to transfer her rights and benefits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In relation to clause (h) of the Agreement Tik testified
                    that <em>the Company</em> (<em>ie</em>, Sarah Design) was to enter into
                    fresh franchise agreements but this was not done “for
                    reasons best known to [Sarah Design] and its
                        directors”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_197" id="Ftn_197_1"><sup>[note: 197]</sup></a></span> When she asked Mr Poh about this, she was
                    informed that Sarah Design and its directors were
                    negotiating with the franchisees for extensions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_198" id="Ftn_198_1"><sup>[note: 198]</sup></a></span> During the hearing, there was some confusion as
                    to whether Tik had any <em>existing</em> franchisees at the time when the
                    Agreement was executed <em>in the first
                        place</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_a"></a>(a)     In her answers to questions by Sarah during
                        cross-examination, Tik explained that she had existing
                        franchisees who were selling old stock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_199" id="Ftn_199_1"><sup>[note: 199]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_b"></a>(b)     However, Tik’s answer to a request by the
                        plaintiffs for further and better particulars suggests
                        that Tik did not have <em>any existing
                            franchisees</em> at the time when the
                        Agreement was entered into. In her defence, Tik averred
                        that she had told Sarah that “her franchisees
                        were not doing well and that there [was] a chance that
                        the franchisees might give up the
                            franchises”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_200" id="Ftn_200_1"><sup>[note: 200]</sup></a></span> The plaintiffs served a request for further
                        and better particulars in respect of this averment. They
                        asked for, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                        names of the franchisees referred to in the averment and
                        the periods for which the franchisees were in

                        SANEON BODYWEAR, K K GARMENTS TRADING and

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The franchisees were in operation from sometime in
                            April 2005. K K GARMENTS TRADING ceased operations
                            sometime in August 2005, SANEON BODYWEAR ceased
                            operations sometime in October 2005 and JSQUARE
                            ceased operations sometime in Jan 2006.
                            BODYWEAR@E_ACE is still in operation till the
                                [<em>sic</em>] July
                            2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the course of re-examining Tik, Tik’s counsel
                        suggested that although the existing franchisees had
                        ceased operations by the time the Agreement was
                        executed, the <em>franchise
                            agreements</em> were still in existence at
                        that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_204" id="Ftn_204_1"><sup>[note: 204]</sup></a></span> I then invited Tik to produce the franchise
                            agreements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_205" id="Ftn_205_1"><sup>[note: 205]</sup></a></span> On the following day, Tik was only able to
                        produce a standard blank franchise
                            agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_206" id="Ftn_206_1"><sup>[note: 206]</sup></a></span> Tik explained that the actual franchise
                        agreements were not in her possession and that she
                        believed that her former husband, Mr Poh, had the
                            agreements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_207" id="Ftn_207_1"><sup>[note: 207]</sup></a></span> However, on the next day, Tik’s
                        counsel informed me that Tik managed to locate the
                        existing franchise agreements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_208" id="Ftn_208_1"><sup>[note: 208]</sup></a></span> The franchise agreements were then
                        introduced through Mr Poh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_209" id="Ftn_209_1"><sup>[note: 209]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_d"></a>(d)     However, the franchise agreements which were produced
                        were all dated between 18 and 22 April 2005 and
                        were valid for a period of one year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_210" id="Ftn_210_1"><sup>[note: 210]</sup></a></span> Hence, by the time the Agreement was
                        executed on 28 April 2006, <em>all
                            the franchise agreements had
                        expired.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I should mention that one of Tik’s witnesses, Chew
                    Hue Hin (“Chew”), stated in his AEIC that he
                    took up a franchise from Tik.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_211" id="Ftn_211_1"><sup>[note: 211]</sup></a></span> The franchise, which was operated through a
                    partnership known as “Casablanca Trading Singapore
                    LLP” (“Casablanca”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_212" id="Ftn_212_1"><sup>[note: 212]</sup></a></span> was not mentioned in Tik’s answers to the
                    plaintiffs’ request for further and better particulars
                    (see [88(b)] above). Chew’s AEIC also suggested that
                    this franchise was still in operation in 2006 and that
                    Casablanca’s business only closed down at the
                        <em>end of 2006</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_213" id="Ftn_213_1"><sup>[note: 213]</sup></a></span> However, in cross-examination, Chew clarified
                    that he withdrew from his partnership in Casablanca sometime
                    in 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_214" id="Ftn_214_1"><sup>[note: 214]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, his partner continued to operate the
                        business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_215" id="Ftn_215_1"><sup>[note: 215]</sup></a></span> The franchise agreement in respect of Casablanca
                    was not disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I find that clause (h) was not breached. The first
                    sentence of the clause required Tik to transfer and assign
                    all the franchise agreements which were “<em>in existence on the
                        1</em><sup>st</sup><em>of June 2006</em>” [emphasis
                    added]. The last sentence of the clause required Tik to
                    ensure that the existing franchisees entered into fresh
                    agreements with Sarah Design. The first and last sentences
                    of clause (h) are linked. Tik’s obligation to ensure
                    that the existing franchisees enter into fresh agreements is
                    consequential on her obligation to transfer franchise
                    agreements that are in existence on 1 June 2006. To the
                    extent that there were no longer any franchise agreements in
                    existence on that date, there would, <em>ipso
                        facto</em>, be no <em>existing</em> franchisees for the purpose of the
                    obligation imposed by the last sentence of clause (h) on Tik
                    to ensure that those franchisees entered into fresh
                    agreements with Sarah Design. It follows from this
                    interpretation that clause (h) was not breached.
                    Tik’s franchisees had ceased operations by the time
                    the Agreement was entered into (see [88(b)]). More
                    importantly, the franchise agreements themselves had also
                    expired by that time (see [88(d)] above). As for
                    Casablanca’s franchise, Chew’s testimony during
                    cross-examination was that he had left the partnership
                    sometime in 2005. Therefore, he was not in a position to
                    give evidence as to whether the franchise was still in
                    operation at the time the Agreement was entered into. The
                    actual franchise agreement was also not put into evidence.
                    Hence, there is no evidence that Casablanca’s
                    franchise agreement was subsisting at the relevant time. I
                    accept Tik’s submission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_216" id="Ftn_216_1"><sup>[note: 216]</sup></a></span> that if there were no <em>existing</em> franchisees as of the date of
                    Agreement, it necessarily follows that Tik could not have
                    been in breach of her obligation to <em>transfer</em> any existing franchise <em>agreements</em> as there was nothing to
                    transfer. Consequently, Tik could not also have been in
                    breach of her obligation to ensure that the existing
                    franchisees entered into new agreements because there were
                    simply no such existing franchisees as on 1 June
                    2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I find that clause (j) of the Agreement was not breached.
                    Apart from the plaintiffs’ bare allegation, there is
                    no evidence that Tik did not transfer any assets or the
                    debts due to her. To the extent that the allegation is that
                    the assets that were not transferred were Tik’s rights
                    under the franchise agreements, my finding that there were
                    no existing franchise agreements applies here (see <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     For a similar reason, I find that clause (k) of the
                    Agreement was not breached. There is no evidence before me
                    that Tik failed to take steps to ensure that the
                    manufacturer continued to supply apparel. In fact, there is
                    evidence that Tik had renewed her master franchise
                    agreement. This was not a bare assertion. She produced a
                    document which stated, on its face, that her master
                    franchise agreement was extended to 31 December
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_217" id="Ftn_217_1"><sup>[note: 217]</sup></a></span> I agree with Tik’s submission that there
                    is no evidence that the plaintiffs had placed any order for

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was it an implied term of the Agreement that the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The law on implied terms is well established. Terms may be
                    implied into a particular contract because of the particular

                    terms implied in fact) or they may be implied in all

                        (<em>ie</em>, terms implied in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I should also mention that it is well established that a
                    term cannot be implied into a contract if it is inconsistent

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     It is not necessary for me to describe the law on implied
                    terms in law because the plaintiffs’ case is that the
                    relevant term should be implied in fact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_219" id="Ftn_219_1"><sup>[note: 219]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I should clarify the precise term that the plaintiffs seek
                    to imply into the Agreement. The plaintiffs have pleaded
                    that the implied term is that the “apparels supplied
                    by the <em>2</em><sup>nd</sup><em>defendant</em> were fit for the
                    Singapore market” [emphasis added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_220" id="Ftn_220_1"><sup>[note: 220]</sup></a></span> This implied term presupposes that Tik was
                    obliged to supply apparels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I find that this implied term is inconsistent with the
                    Agreement. The Agreement does not require Tik to supply the
                    “POLICE” brand of apparel. Tik was <em>entitled</em> to do so under clause (i)
                    of the Agreement. However, the Agreement did not impose an
                    obligation on her to supply the apparel. As the preamble to
                    the Agreement states, the purpose of the Agreement was for
                    the plaintiffs to acquire a stake in Tik’s
                    “business in relation to the ‘POLICE’
                    [brand] of apparels”. The manner in which the
                    Agreement implemented this purpose was for the parties to
                    set up a company (see clause (b) of the Agreement). Tik
                    would then transfer <em>all</em> her
                    rights and benefits in relation to the trade and brand name
                    “POLICE” to this company (see clause (f) of
                    the Agreement). Each of the parties to the Agreement would
                    then hold a certain proportion of the equity in the company
                    (see clauses (c) and (d) of the Agreement). Hence, what the
                    Agreement contemplates is for a complete transfer of
                    Tik’s business to a new company. Although not
                    expressly provided for in the Agreement, the new company
                    would then have to obtain its supply of apparel directly
                    from the manufacturer because the Agreement required Tik to
                    transfer all her rights in relation to the trade and brand
                    name “POLICE” to the new company. As stated
                    earlier in this paragraph, there is a non-obligatory
                    provision for Tik to purchase apparel for the benefit of
                    Sarah Design. In addition, the Agreement also imposes a
                    covenant on Tik to ensure that the manufacturer continues
                    the supply of the apparel (see clause (k)). Given this
                    structure, it would be inconsistent to imply a term that
                    imposes an obligation on Tik to <em>supply</em> apparel and, further, that those
                    apparel would be fit for the Singapore market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Further, the plaintiffs’ case on implied terms is
                    premised on their allegation that Tik’s stock only
                    carried one size. The evidence on this score is to the
                    contrary. During the trial, Tik produced samples of
                    “POLICE” apparel in different
                        sizes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_221" id="Ftn_221_1"><sup>[note: 221]</sup></a></span> Apart from a bare denial, the plaintiffs did not

<p class="Judg-1">I find that Tik actually had apparel of different sizes.
                    This finding is supported by the above responses. The

                        Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another
                        appeal</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413
                        (“<em>RDC
                    Concrete</em>”) considered the law on
                    termination of contracts in considerable detail. There are
                    two broad categories of situations in which a party may
                    terminate a contract. The first category concerns contracts
                    which expressly provide that an innocent party may terminate
                    the contract if certain events occur (<em>RDC
                        Concrete</em> at [91] (the Court of Appeal termed this
                    category as “Situation 1”)). This category is
                    not applicable in the present case. The second category
                    involves contracts which do <em>not</em> explicitly provide for the events that
                    would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract
                        (<em>RDC Concrete</em> at [92]). In this category of
                    contracts, a right to terminate the contract may arise in
                    three situations (the Court of Appeal labelled these
                    situations as “Situation 2”, “Situation
                    3(a)” and “Situation 3(b)”). Situation
                    2 involves a party <em>renouncing</em>
                    the contract (<em>RDC Contract</em> at
                        [93]). Situation
                    3(a) arises if the parties’ intention was “to
                    designate the term [that was breached] as one that is so
                    important that any breach, regardless of the actual
                    consequences of such a breach, would entitle the innocent
                    party to terminate the contract” (<em>RDC Concrete</em> at [97] [emphasis in original omitted]). Such a
                    term is usually called a “condition”
                        (<em>RDC Concrete</em> at [97]). Finally, Situation
                    3(b) arises where the consequence of the breach is such that
                    it deprives the innocent party of “substantially the
                    whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain
                    from the contract” (<em>RDC
                        Concrete</em> at [99] citing <em>Hongkong Fir
                        Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    When faced with a repudiatory breach, an innocent party
                    has a choice. He can either treat the contract as subsisting
                        (<em>ie</em>, he can
                    “affirm” the contract) or he can
                    “accept” the repudiation and bring the

                        Contracts</em> explain, an express communication
                    of the fact of acceptance of the repudiation is not the only
                    mode of acceptance (see <em>Chitty on

<b>Acceptance by
                            repudiation.</b> Where there is an
                        anticipatory breach, or breach of an executory contract,
                        and the innocent party wishes to treat himself as
                        discharged, he must “accept the
                        repudiation”. An act of acceptance of a
                        repudiation requires no particular form. It is usually
                        done by communicating the decision to terminate to the
                        party in default, although it may be sufficient to lead
                        evidence of an:</p>

                        unequivocal to constitute acceptance of a repudiation.
                        It all depends on “the particular contractual

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    A final point should be noted before I turn to the facts.
                    An innocent party is entitled to rely on a ground for
                    terminating the contract even if it did not rely on that
                    ground at the time of termination (see the decision of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Alliance Concrete
                        Singapore Pte Ltd v Comfort Resources Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 602 (“<em>Alliance
                        Concrete</em>”) at [63]). However, this
                    entitlement does not apply if the party in breach could have
                    remedied the situation if it had been given the opportunity
                    to do so (see <em>Alliance
                        Concrete</em> at [67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I have found that only clause (f) of the Agreement was
                    breached. In my view, the nature of clause (f) was such that
                    its breach fell within both Situation 3(a) and Situation
                    3(b) of <em>RDC Concrete</em>. Clause
                    (f) was such a crucial term that the parties must have
                    contemplated that any breach of it would entitle the
                    innocent party to termination. As mentioned above, the very
                    purpose of the Agreement was for the plaintiffs to
                    participate in Tik’s “POLICE” business.
                    In order to allow such participation, the Agreement
                    contemplated that Tik had to transfer that business to a new
                    company. Given the importance of this term, I find that the
                    breach of it entitled the plaintiffs to terminate the
                    Agreement. I also find, in the alternative, that Tik’s
                    failure to comply with clause (f) was such as to deprive the
                    plaintiffs of substantially the whole benefit of the
                    Agreement. In other words, Situation 3(b) is applicable as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    I accept that the decision to strike off Sarah Design was
                    an unequivocal overt act that was inconsistent with the
                    existence of the Agreement. Sarah produced an undated
                    resolution by Sarah Design’s board of directors (which
                    included the plaintiffs) to strike off Sarah

<p class="Judg-1">Sarah Design was the entity through which the plaintiffs
                    were to participate in the “POLICE” business.
                    By striking off Sarah Design, the plaintiffs had objectively
                    demonstrated that they did not wish to continue with the
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    However, Tik’s breach of clause (f) was not raised
                    as the reason for terminating the Agreement at the time of
                    the purported termination in striking off Sarah Design.
                    According to Tik, she was told by the plaintiffs that the
                    reason for their decision to strike off Sarah Design was
                    that the plaintiffs had no time to continue the

                    second plaintiff was of the view that there was no money to
                    buy “POLICE” brand apparel of a suitable size
                    for the Australian market.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_226" id="Ftn_226_1"><sup>[note: 226]</sup></a></span> According to Sarah, the reason for her decision
                    to terminate the Agreement was that two months after
                    entering into the Agreement, the second plaintiff formed the
                    view that she could not cope with operating Sarah
                    Design’s business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_227" id="Ftn_227_1"><sup>[note: 227]</sup></a></span> Hence, the plaintiffs decided to ask Tik to find
                    someone to buy them out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_228" id="Ftn_228_1"><sup>[note: 228]</sup></a></span> Apparently, Tik gave various excuses for not
                    finding a buyer and so, after two years had passed, the
                    plaintiffs decided to strike off Sarah Design.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_229" id="Ftn_229_1"><sup>[note: 229]</sup></a></span> Ivy gave a different reason for the termination
                    of the Agreement. According to her, the reason for her
                    decision to terminate the Agreement was that the stock that
                    Tik was meant to transfer to Sarah Design was “not
                    worth [$]80,000”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_230" id="Ftn_230_1"><sup>[note: 230]</sup></a></span> What is clear is that on <em>both</em> Tik’s version and the
                    plaintiffs’ versions, Tik’s breach of clause (f)
                    was <em>not</em> the reason for
                    terminating the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The question that I then have to consider is whether the
                    plaintiffs are entitled to rely on the breach of clause (f)
                    even though that breach was not the reason for the purported
                    termination. The answer turns on whether Tik could have
                    fulfilled her obligation under clause (f) if she was given
                    an opportunity to do so (see <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I find on a balance of probabilities that Tik could have
                    fulfilled her obligation under clause (f) if she was asked
                    to do so. Tik’s evidence in her AEIC was that she had
                    obtained the approval of the manufacturer of the
                    “POLICE” brand of apparel for the assignment
                    of her sole distribution rights to Sarah Design.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_231" id="Ftn_231_1"><sup>[note: 231]</sup></a></span> She asserted that the manufacturer agreed to
                    this request and asked for the necessary documents to be
                    prepared and sent to it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_232" id="Ftn_232_1"><sup>[note: 232]</sup></a></span> She claimed that the relevant documents were
                    never prepared by Sarah Design.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_233" id="Ftn_233_1"><sup>[note: 233]</sup></a></span> As I noted above (see <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a>), Tik’s evidence was based on an
                    erroneous understanding of the Agreement because the
                    Agreement placed the onus on <em>her</em> to transfer her rights. However, her
                    evidence, which she maintained in response to questions by
                    the court<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_234" id="Ftn_234_1"><sup>[note: 234]</sup></a></span> and in her response to a question by her counsel
                    during re-examination,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_235" id="Ftn_235_1"><sup>[note: 235]</sup></a></span> shows that she was ready, willing and able to
                    take the necessary steps to comply with her obligation under
                    clause (f). I accept her evidence that she could have
                    fulfilled her obligation if she was told by the plaintiffs
                    that the Agreement was being terminated due to her failure
                    to comply with that obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Given my finding that Tik could have fulfilled her
                    obligation under clause (f) of the Agreement if she was
                    given the opportunity to do so, the plaintiffs cannot rely
                    on the breach of clause (f) to justify their decision to
                    terminate the Agreement. Hence, even though the breach of
                    clause (f) was repudiatory in nature, the plaintiffs were
                    not entitled to terminate the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Are the plaintiffs entitled to damages for the
                breaches of contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In principle, the plaintiffs are entitled to damages to
                    compensate them for losses <em>caused</em> by the breach of clause (f) of the
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I appreciate that the plaintiffs have pleaded for damages
                    to be assessed. However, causation is an element that is
                    relevant to the issue of liability (see the decision of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Asia Hotel Investments

                    [143]–[147]). Quite apart from the quantum of the loss
                    suffered, I find that the plaintiffs have not sustained any
                    losses that were <em>caused</em> by the
                    breach of clause (f). As alluded to above, the plaintiffs
                    wanted to back out of the Agreement at a relatively early
                    stage (see <a href="#p1_104">[104]</a>
                    above). According to Sarah, two months after entering into
                    the Agreement, Ivy formed the view that she could not cope
                    with operating Sarah Design’s business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_236" id="Ftn_236_1"><sup>[note: 236]</sup></a></span> Hence, the plaintiffs decided to ask Tik to find

                    to terminate the Agreement was that the stock that Sarah
                    Design was meant to take over was not worth the amount of
                    the plaintiffs’ investment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_238" id="Ftn_238_1"><sup>[note: 238]</sup></a></span> The inference to be drawn from the
                    plaintiffs’ own evidence is that they were not
                    concerned with Tik’s breach of clause (f). They took
                    an independent decision to exit the Agreement.</p>

                    misrepresentations in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16     The classic
                        formulation of the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation
                        or deceit is to be found in the judgment of Lord
                        Herschell in the leading House of Lords decision of
                            <em>Derry v Peek</em> (1889) 14
                        App Cas 337, where the learned law lord observed as
                        follows (at 374):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">First, in order to sustain an action of deceit,
                            there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of
                            that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved when it
                            is shewn that a false representation has been made
                            (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth,
                            or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or
                            false. Although I have treated the second and third
                            as distinct cases, I think the third is but an
                            instance of the second, for one who makes a
                            statement under such circumstances can have no real
                            belief in the truth of what he states. To prevent a
                            false statement [from] being fraudulent, there must,
                            I think, always be an honest belief in its truth.
                            And this probably covers the whole ground, for one
                            who knowingly alleges that which is false, has
                            obviously no such honest belief. Thirdly, if fraud
                            be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is
                            immaterial. It matters not that there was no
                            intention to cheat or injure the person to whom the
                            statement was made.</p>

                    were concisely restated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee</em>
                    [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 (“<em>Panatron</em>”) at [14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    The essentials of this tort have been set out by
                            Lord Maugham in <em>Bradford
                                Building Society v
                            Borders</em> [1941] 2 All ER 205.
                            Basically there are the following essential
                            elements. First, there must be a representation of
                            fact made by words or conduct. Second, the
                            representation must be made with the intention that
                            it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a
                            class of persons which includes the plaintiff.
                            Third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had
                            acted upon the false statement. Fourth, it must be
                            proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so
                            doing. Fifth, the representation must be made with
                            knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully
                            false, or at least made in the absence of any
                            genuine belief that it is true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    To recapitulate, both plaintiffs gave evidence that Tik
                    had made the following representations to induce them to
                    enter into the Agreement and to pay her the sum of
                        $80,000:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_239" id="Ftn_239_1"><sup>[note: 239]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_a"></a>(a)     The existing four franchisees selling
                        “POLICE” brand apparel were doing well and
                        would not close down in the near future.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_b"></a>(b)     Tik would purchase the plaintiffs’ 50% share of
                        the equity of Sarah Design at a minimum sum of $80,000
                        if they did not wish to continue the
                        “POLICE” business at any time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In relation to the first representation, as noted above,
                    it emerged in the course of Tik’s cross-examination
                    that there were actually no existing franchisees selling
                    “POLICE” brand apparel (see <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> above). However, Tik did
                    not deny discussing the status of the
                    “existing” franchisees. In her AEIC, Tik
                    stated that she had told Sarah that her
                    “POLICE” business was “not doing
                    well” and that “chances [were] that the
                    franchisees might be giving up”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_240" id="Ftn_240_1"><sup>[note: 240]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I find that Tik made the first representation to the
                    plaintiffs for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    First, the presence of clause (h) in the Agreement shows
                    that Tik must have informed the plaintiffs that the
                    franchisees were doing well. If Tik’s franchisees were
                    not doing well and if chances were that the franchisees
                    might “give up”, there would have been little
                    purpose in including clause (h) in the Agreement to impose
                    an obligation on Tik to transfer the franchise agreements to
                    Sarah Design at a <em>future date</em>
                        (<em>ie</em>, 1 June
                    2006).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Second, it simply makes no commercial sense for the
                    plaintiffs to have wanted to participate in Tik’s
                    “POLICE” business if the existing franchisees
                    were doing badly as alleged by Tik. Unless there was
                    something extraordinary about the “POLICE”
                    business, it defies logic that the plaintiffs would
                    willingly enter into a loss-making venture<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_241" id="Ftn_241_1"><sup>[note: 241]</sup></a></span>. I am not satisfied with Tik’s
                    explanations as to why the plaintiffs would have wanted to
                    invest in the “POLICE” business even though
                    she had told them that the franchisees might be
                    “giving up”. Her initial explanation was that
                    Sarah liked the “POLICE” brand. Further, Ivy
                    had never worked and wanted to do business. The second part
                    of this explanation is not convincing. Even if Ivy wanted to
                    try her hand at business, it does not make sense that she
                    would have wanted to start out in a loss-making venture.
                    When questioned further, Tik resorted to saying that Sarah
                    wanted to participate in the “POLICE” business
                    because she had a lot of rich friends to whom she could sell
                    franchises. While this explanation was more plausible, it
                    was an entirely different explanation from her earlier
                    response. I should add that Tik had yet another explanation
                    in her AEIC for the reason why Sarah persisted in wanting to
                    participate in the “POLICE” business
                    notwithstanding Tik’s caution that the business was
                    not doing well. Apparently, Sarah said that “she was
                    a good saleswoman and she would be able to turn the business
                    around”, that she “wanted to bring the product
                    to Australia and start a franchise chain in
                    Australia” and that “her sister, [Ivy] would
                    also be a partner in the business and both of them could
                    turn the business around”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_242" id="Ftn_242_1"><sup>[note: 242]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Third, the very structure of Tik’s business was to
                    supply “POLICE” brand apparel <em>to franchisees</em>. In
                    cross-examination, Ivy testified that she understood the
                    structure of the “POLICE” business to be based
                    on the sale of apparel to <em>franchisees</em>:</p>

                            to take over the brand, POLICE?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yah. 50%, is it? We have to take over 50%, is it?

<p class="Judg-1">Since the structure of the business was to sell apparel to
                    franchisees, it would not have made sense for the plaintiffs
                    to have wanted to enter into the Agreement if they were told
                    it was likely that the then existing franchisees might give
                    up. Furthermore, Sarah Design was to take over Tik’s
                    existing stock of “POLICE” brand apparel.
                    There is no reason why the plaintiffs would have wanted to
                    take over the stock if there was no ready market for it in
                    the form of healthy existing franchisees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    For the same reason, I find that the first representation
                    must have induced the plaintiffs to enter into the
                    Agreement. The presence of four then existing franchisees
                    that were doing well must have had a bearing on the
                    plaintiffs’ decision to enter into the Agreement. As
                    mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the very structure of
                    the business depended on the sale of apparel to
                    franchisees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    I also find that the representation was made fraudulently
                    because Tik must have known that the first representation
                    was untrue. Her own responses to a request for further and
                    better particulars state that the franchisees had ceased
                    operations before the Agreement was executed (see [88(b)]
                    above). If they had ceased operations, Tik must have known
                    that it was false to say that they were doing well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In summary, I find that the plaintiffs have made out a
                    case against Tik for fraudulent misrepresentation in
                    relation to the first representation. The elements of the
                    tort, as set out in <em>Panatron</em>
                    (see <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a> above), are
                    satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first representation was indeed made to the
                        plaintiffs (see <a href="#p1_114">[114]</a>–<a href="#p1_117">[117]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_b"></a>(b)     The representation must have been made with the
                        intention that the plaintiffs should act upon it. There
                        would have been no reason for Tik to have otherwise made
                        the representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_c"></a>(c)     The representation induced the plaintiffs into
                        entering into the Agreement (see <a href="#p1_118">[118]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiffs have suffered at least some damage as a
                        consequence of their reliance on the representation.
                        They paid the sum of $80,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_e"></a>(e)     The representation was made fraudulently
                            (see <a href="#p1_119">[119]</a>
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Consequently, the plaintiffs are entitled to rescission of
                    the Agreement (see, for example, the decision of the High
                    Court in <em>Chee Jok </em><em>Heng Stephanie v Chang Yue </em><em>Shoon</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1131
                        at [18]).
                    They are also entitled to damages. As for amount of damages,
                    the plaintiffs are entitled to be compensated for all losses
                    flowing directly as a result of the plaintiffs’ entry
                    into the Agreement regardless of whether the loss was
                    foreseeable (see <em>Wishing
                        Star</em> at [21]). As the plaintiffs have pleaded for
                    damages to be assessed, they are entitled to interlocutory
                    judgment for damages to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    As for the second representation, I find that the
                    plaintiffs have not proven on a balance of probabilities
                    that the representation was made in the first place. Apart
                    from their bare assertions, they have not been able to
                    produce any other evidence to support the fact that this
                    representation was made. Since this crucial element of the
                    claim has not been proven, the plaintiffs’ claim in
                    fraudulent misrepresentation for the second representation
                    must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Sarah’s Trust and Blackmail Claims against the first
                    and second defendants fail in their entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In relation to the Contract Claims, the plaintiffs are
                    entitled to interlocutory judgment for damages to be
                    assessed with the question of interest to be reserved to the
                    Registrar. They are also entitled to rescission of the
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    As a litigant in person, Andy is entitled to a claim
                    against Sarah for compensatory costs under O 59
                    r 18A of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006
                    Rev Ed), for the time spent for action, as well as other
                    reasonable expenses (see <em>Aldabe
                        </em><em>Fermin v Standard
                        Chartered Bank</em> [2010] 3 SLR 722
                    at [130]). The time spent for the Trust Claim was
                    significantly more than the time for the Contract Claims.
                    Given that the plaintiffs only succeeded in one aspect of
                    their Contract Claims and Sarah failed in the Trust Claim
                    against Tik, I shall order Sarah to pay 50% of the costs of
                    the action to Tik to be taxed if not agreed. No further
                    order as to costs in relation to Ivy.</p>
