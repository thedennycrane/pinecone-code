<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1.

        The appellants, Mr Anwar Siraj and Madam Norma

Khoo Cheng Neo, engaged the respondent building contractors, Teo Hee Lai Building

Construction Pte Ltd ("THL"), to construct a house for them. They lodged this

appeal in order to set aside an injunction restraining them from making a demand under a

performance bond issued by Tai Ping Insurance in their favour pursuant to the terms of the

building contract. We allowed the appeal and now give the reasons for our decision. </font>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Background</font></p></i>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        The appellants, the owners of No 2 Siglap

Valley, entered into a contract with THL on 30 December 1999 for the demolition of the

house then standing on the property and the construction of a new house. The cost of the

construction work was $1,200,000 and the agreed date for the completion of the new house

was 9 January 2001. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        THL was required by the building contract to

procure a performance bond in the appellants’ favour for 10% of the cost of

construction. As such, they arranged for Tai Ping Insurance Co ("Tai Ping") to

furnish a performance bond for the sum of $120,000 on 12 January 2001. The bond provided

that the insurance company would pay the appellants the sum of $120,000

"unconditionally and immediately on demand and without any reference to the

contractor and notwithstanding any dispute or difference which may have arisen under or in

connection with the contract".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        The construction of the house was not completed

by 9 January 2001 and the house was handed over to the appellants on 5 April 2001. As

such, liquidated damages at the rate of $1,000 per day was payable by THL to the

appellants. At the date of handing over of the house, a number of defects listed by the

appellants’ architect, Mr Tan Hock Beng of Maps Design Studio, had not been

rectified. The architect then wrote to THL to request for an undertaking that the latter

would rectify all the stated defects. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        THL complained that that they were denied

access to the appellants’ premises to carry out the rectification work. In August

2001, they gave the appellants notice of arbitration. THL said that they would bear the

cost of rectification work pending the arbitrator’s finding as to who should be

responsible for the cost.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        On 20 September 2001, the appellants, who

contended that THL breached their contractual obligation to rectify the defects noted by

the architect, made a demand under the performance bond for $120,000. When Tai Ping did

not pay the amount claimed, the appellants issued a writ against them. THL then sought an

interim injunction to restrain the appellants from obtaining any payment from Tai Ping

under the performance bond. An ex-parte interim injunction was granted by the District

Court but it was set aside on 14 January 2002. THL appealed to the High Court and

persuaded the judicial commissioner who heard the appeal to restore the interim

injunction. The appellants sought and obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal

against the decision of the judicial commissioner.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The decision of the judicial

commisisoner</font></p></i>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        The judicial commissioner noted that THL had

alleged that the first appellant had been an extremely difficult client and that he had

interfered with the architect’s duties. He also noted that THL had alleged that some

of the problems in relation to the construction of the house were caused by design error

and he thought that they had put up a reasonable case. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        The judicial commissioner pointed out that THL

had alleged that they had been denied the opportunity to carry out remedial work during

the maintenance period. There was a dispute as to whether THL’s expert, one Mr Donald

Payne ("Payne"), should have been allowed to attend meetings with the architect.

The judicial commissioner, who pointed out that a contractor is entitled to be assisted by

any person in his attempt to keep a proper record of the works to be completed before and

after rectification work has been carried out, was satisfied that the architect and the

first appellant had acted oppressively by denying THL the assistance which Payne could

have rendered them. After taking all the circumstances into account, he ruled that there

was sufficient evidence of unconscionability on the part of the appellants. As such, he

agreed that the appellants should be restrained from making a demand or receiving any

payment under the performance bond until their dispute with THL has been resolved through

arbitration.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The appeal</font></p></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        This court has stated on numerous occasions

that fraud and unconscionability are grounds for restraining a beneficiary of a

performance bond from insisting on his right to demand payment under the bond. (See, for

instance, <i>Bocotra Construction Pte Ltd v Attorney-General </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9304&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 2 SLR 523</a><i>.</i>)<i>
</i>As there is no allegation of fraud in this case, the only issue which arises is

whether or not the appellants have acted unconscionably when they made a demand for

payment under the performance bond issued by Tai Ping. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        As for what constitutes unconscionable conduct,

in <i>Eltraco International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59716&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 4 SLR 290</a>,

298-299, this court stated as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In <i>Dauphine Offshore </i>this

    court did not think it possible to define what would constitute

    ‘unconscionability’. Lack of bona fide would in most instances indicate such

    ‘unconscionability’. The situation in each case would naturally differ from

    another. Thus, there we stated (at p 668):</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What kind of situation would

      constitute unconscionability would have to depend on the facts of each case…. There

      is no pre-determined categorisation….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The appellants would appear to

      suggest that … unfairness, per se, could constitute 'unconscionability'. We do not

      think it necessarily follows…. In every instance of unconscionability there would be

      an element of unfairness. But the reverse is not necessarily true. It does not mean that

      in every instance where there is unfairness it would amount to

      ‘unconscionability’. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        As for the standard of proof required to

establish unconscionability on the part of a person who is making a call on a performance

bond, the position was made very clear in <i>Dauphin Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading

Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50947&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 657</a>, 672, where this court stated as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In [<i>Bocotra’s case</i>]<i>
</i>this court stated that ‘a high degree of strictness applies, as the applicant

    will be required to establish a clear case of fraud or unconscionability in the

    interlocutory proceedings. It is clear that mere allegations are insufficient…. In

    our opinion, what must be shown is a strong prima facie case of unconscionability.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        THL’s counsel, Mr S Thulasidas, asserted

at the hearing of the appeal that the appellants had acted unconscionably by making a

demand for payment under the performance bond for a number of reasons. First, the

appellants ought not have made a demand for payment under the performance bond because

they had sufficient security for their claims. Secondly, a major complaint of the

appellants, namely the flooding of the basement and the debonding of the basement tiles

would not have occurred if the architect’s design had not been defective. Thirdly,

THL had been denied access into the appellants’ premises to carry out rectification

work.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        The contention that the appellants ought not

have made a demand for payment under the performance bond as they had sufficient security

in their hands will first be considered. It was pointed out that the appellants held

$290,000 of THL’s money because the latter’s claim for a progress payment, which

amounted to $265,190.17, had not been certified by the architect. Furthermore, there was a

retention sum of $24,010.86. However, the appellants contended that it should not be

overlooked that the quantity surveyor had estimated the cost of rectification work

required by the architect to be more than $500,000. They submitted that if their claim for

liquidated damages for delayed completion, which amounted to $84,000, was taken into

account together with the estimated cost of rectification work, their demand for $120,000

under the performance bond was not unreasonable. It is not our task to determine whether

the appellants’ or THL’s estimated cost for the rectification of defects is more

realistic. Neither is it our task to determine whether or not the architect should have

certified THL’s claim for $265,190.17. In the circumstances, it was not established

that it was unconscionable for the appellants to make a demand under the terms of the

performance because they had sufficient security for the cost of rectification work.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        As for THL’s assertion that some of the

appellants’ complaints, including the flooding of the basement, were due to a defect

in the architect’s design, the appellants retorted that the flooding and the damage

to the basement tiles resulted from THL’s failure to build in accordance with the

architect’s plans, which had been approved by the relevant authorities. We were in no

position to conclude that there has been defective designing by the architect. As such, it

could not be said that the appellants’ call on the performance bond was

unconscionable on the ground that the architect’s plans were defective.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        Finally, the question of access to the

appellants’ premises will be considered. THL complained that their expert, Payne, was

not allowed into the premises to look into the alleged defects. We agree with the judicial

commissioner that THL should not be obstructed in their attempt to get an expert to help

them evaluate the position. The appellants asserted that they were not unwilling to allow

Payne to enter their premises and the impasse arose because THL failed to respond to their

request for particulars of Payne’s credentials. Evidently, the dispute concerning the

entry into the appellants’ house by Payne has been blown out of proportion.

Admittedly, the appellants could have been more co-operative but THL could have provided

the requested particulars with the greatest of ease. Consequently, months passed because

of the intransigence of both parties. We were unable to conclude from the voluminous

correspondence between the parties on this matter that the appellants were clearly at

fault and that they were guilty of unconscionable conduct in relation to the entry of

Payne into their premises.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        We are mindful of the fact that in <i>Eltraco

International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59716&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 4 SLR 290</a>, 299, this court

noted that it "is important that the courts guard against unnecessarily interfering

with contractual arrangements freely entered into by the parties". The terms of the

performance bond are crystal clear and they are that the insurers shall

"unconditionally and immediately on demand without any reference to the contractor

and notwithstanding any dispute or difference which may have arisen under or in connection

with the contract" make a payment under the performance bond. As a case of

unconscionability on the part of the appellants was not made out, we allowed the appeal

with costs and set aside the injunction restraining the appellants from making a demand

under the performance bond issued in their favour. The appellants are entitled to costs.</font></p>
