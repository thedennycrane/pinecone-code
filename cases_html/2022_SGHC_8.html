</div> that as the arbitration was seated in Singapore, the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) applied by virtue of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), and relied particularly on Article 18 of the Model Law which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Article 18.

Its first point was that Brown Marine and Fichte had in fact agreed to an extension of time to the deadline originally set by the arbitrator, pushing it back to 9 April 2021, without any specification of the time. What follows from this is that there was no default of that original deadline. According to the Charterer, Brown Marine unfairly engineered the situation when it falsely stated that there had been no agreed extension.

The Owner contended that not only was the time allowed for filing of the defence submissions sufficient, but also that the Charterer had not objected to the deadline imposed of “17:00 London Time” on 9 April 2021 and understood that its submission was late. Moreover, the Charterer had known of the severe sanction for non-compliance for some five weeks beforehand.

The choice of seat may clothe the arbitrator with powers provided by a statute in force at the seat. The choice of arbitral rules to govern the arbitration may also clothe the arbitrator with powers provided under those chosen rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The seat was Singapore, and it is obvious that the arbitrator was wrong to refer to and rely on powers to make peremptory orders under the UK Arbitration Act. It is not clear why he referred to the position under the UK Arbitration Act. I would presume in the arbitrator’s favour that this was simply a mistaken assumption on his part that probably flowed from his practice being principally in London-seated arbitrations. It does mean that the arbitrator adopted the wrong procedural law. If he did, and as a result he followed an arbitration procedure such as invoking a power to make a particular peremptory order on a basis or in a way not available to an arbitrator in a Singapore-seated arbitration, that would not be in accordance with the agreement of the parties and so would be amenable to challenge under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Continuing with the inquiry into what his powers in fact were, the next point is that there were no arbitral rules chosen by parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The inquiry thus proceeds to consideration of what powers an arbitrator has in a Singapore-seated arbitration for which no arbitral rules have been agreed. For this, I turn to the IAA. Section 3 of the IAA gives the Model Law (other than Chapter VIII thereof, and all subject to the other provisions of the IAA) the force of law. Its English text is set out in the first schedule to the IAA. Accordingly, it is the Model Law to which the arbitrator should have looked before considering whether to make or enforce any peremptory orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The phrase peremptory order is not to be found in the Model Law. Instead, reading Arts 23 and 25 together, the Model Law provides that where a respondent fails to communicate his statement of defence within the period of time agreed by the parties or determined by the arbitral tribunal, without showing sufficient cause, then the arbitral tribunal shall continue the proceedings without treating such failure in itself as an admission of the claimant’s allegation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Articles 23 and 25 read together break down into three elements:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The respondent has a period of time to communicate his statement of defence that depends on what is agreed by the parties, or if not, then as determined by the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If he fails to do so, unless otherwise agreed by parties, the arbitrator must consider whether the party in default has shown sufficient cause for the failure; then</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the arbitrator shall continue with proceedings without treating such failure as an admission of the claimant’s allegations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I would also observe that Art 25 does not mandate general peremptory or unless orders. It differs from the provisions for judgment in default of defence or for striking out of a defence and consequent judgment for non-compliance with discovery orders that one finds in court rules. It is those sorts of consequences that might be described as draconian and which were the subject of consideration by the court in <span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span>, a decision relied on by the Charterer as described at [27] above. Continuing with the proceedings in the absence of a defence but without any admission of the claim is a simple and necessary provision to enable claimants to obtain an arbitration award where the respondent does not participate in the proceedings. There is no requirement under Art 25 that the arbitrator first find that the order has been breached intentionally, contumeliously or contumaciously, although the defaulter’s conduct would be relevant to the inquiry into whether there was sufficient cause for the default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It would have been open to the arbitrator to raise with parties at an appropriate stage of the arbitration the possible adoption of arbitral rules, or indeed to construct a bespoke procedure for parties’ agreement. In this way, his powers could have been enlarged by agreement. This, however, did not happen. There does not seem to have been any procedural meeting at all, nor any general procedural timetable issued, nor any proposal made to parties of steps and timelines with any invitation to comment. Often, the first action of an arbitrator would be to convene a procedural meeting, even if only by telephone or other remote means, for the purpose of consulting parties on an appropriate procedure and timetable for the conduct of the arbitration. If anything, this is all the more important in an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> arbitration where there are no arbitral rules chosen by parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 That consulting parties on procedure is expected, usual, and hardly onerous, is obvious. Whether not consulting parties breaches the fair hearing or the equal treatment rule is a further question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The first point to make is that what procedure is adopted and how long parties are to be given for each step does bear on the question of reasonable opportunity to present one’s case on the merits. Indeed, it has been said that “a sound procedural architecture is <span class="font-italic">necessary</span> if we are to transform a set of <span class="font-italic">laws</span> into a system of <span class="font-italic">justice</span>.” [emphasis in original]: per Sundaresh Menon, Chief Justice, “Gateway to Justice: The Centrality of Procedure in the Pursuit of Justice”, 36th Annual Lecture of the School of International Arbitration in Dispute Resolution (30 November 2021), at para 9.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It follows from the relationship of procedure to the delivery of justice on the merits that giving parties a fair opportunity to present their case includes consulting them on procedural steps and timelines. As for the obligation of equal treatment, this applies both to how consultation must take place, as well as to the steps and timelines adopted following such consultation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Thus, at the first stage, before determining the period of time for communicating the statement of defence in the absence of agreement, an arbitrator must consult both parties, not just one of them. If for any reason an arbitrator does not consult both parties and simply fixes the period of time by himself, he must be open to reconsidering the time fixed upon request by either party, but especially the party bound by the timeline he has fixed unilaterally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 At the second stage, when considering whether the party in default has shown sufficient cause for the failure to communicate the statement of defence within the period fixed, the arbitrator must hear both parties. If he gives both parties the reasonable opportunity to be heard on the question of sufficiency of cause, then it is for him to determine the sufficiency, or otherwise, of that cause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 That sufficiency is a matter for the arbitrator to determine after hearing from parties is supported by the learned authors of Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore vol 1(2) (LexisNexis, 2021), who say at para 20.086 in relation to Art 25 of the Model Law:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the case of a respondent, if he fails to serve his statement of defence, the tribunal may proceed with the arbitration and make an award on the evidence before it. The failure to serve the statement of defence is however not to be treated as an admission of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The power to proceed in default is exercisable if the tribunal is satisfied that the defaulter has not shown ‘sufficient cause’ for its failure. This requirement also carries with it the implication that the tribunal should give a reasonable opportunity for the defaulting party to explain its failure to comply. The sufficiency or insufficiency of the reasons is a matter to be determined by the tribunal and not the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 However, that the court does not determine the sufficiency of cause does not mean that the arbitrator’s decision on sufficiency is wholly immune from review. The proper approach a court should take to procedural decisions of a tribunal has been authoritatively stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CMNC</span> at [98] and reiterated by it in <span class="font-italic">CBS v CBP</span> [2021] 1 SLR 935 at [51]. That approach is to ask whether “what the tribunal did (or decided not to do) falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I now turn to assess what the arbitrator did against the backdrop of his procedural powers under the Model Law, asking myself whether what he did or decided not to do falls within the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the arbitrator acted within his powers, and exercised them in accordance with the principles of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56  The first aspect to consider is how the period of time for communicating the defence submissions was fixed. The arbitrator took the period of time suggested by the Owner in its claim submissions provided on 3 March 2021 for the Charterer’s defence submissions and simply incorporated that in his order of 4 March 2021 with one tweak: stipulating a time on 31 March 2021, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> “16:00 London time”. The arbitrator did not invite the Charterer’s input on the question of how much time it might need, whether before fixing that time nor in his order issued to the Charterer. Nor does the arbitrator appear to have even asked himself whether a period of 28 days would be sufficient in the circumstances, especially given that the Owner had taken ten months after the first award to provide its claim submissions and that, as he far as he would be aware, the Charterer was not necessarily expecting the service of the claim submissions at that time.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57  I find that there was a breach of natural justice in not giving the Charterer any opportunity to provide input on the time needed to serve its defence submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The order made on 4 March 2021 was not itself a peremptory order. What it did was to warn the Charterer that if it did not serve its defence submissions, the Owner might “apply for a short final and peremptory order which will include a severe sanction against the Charterer in the event that it fails to comply”. Thus, it envisaged that if the Charterer failed to serve its defence submissions, there could then be an application by the Owner for a peremptory order. It must be read in favour of the arbitrator that at this point he had not decided that a short final and peremptory order would follow regardless of the reasons for non-compliance, nor that there would definitely be a severe sanction attached, notwithstanding that the tone of the order suggests to a fair-minded reader a degree of predetermination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In any event, the Charterer seems to have been able to appoint Fichte, and Fichte was able to put together a draft of its defence submissions by 31 March 2021. At this point, apparently at “13:31 London time” on 31 March 2021 (about two and a half hours before the deadline), Fichte reached out to Brown Marine seeking a one-week extension until 9 April 2021, asking for a prompt reply so that they would not have to bother the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Brown Marine came back to say that they could only recommend agreement if it was on a final and peremptory basis and sought confirmation that this was the case. Fichte responded to give that confirmation, but for some reason Brown Marine appears to have misread this as a withdrawal of the request for an extension, and when “16:00 London time” came and went, they wrote the next day to the arbitrator, copying Fichte, informing the arbitrator that the defence submissions had not “materialised” and wrongly stating that the Charterer’s representatives had “decided they did not need” any extension of time and concluded that they looked forward to hearing from the arbitrator. Fichte replied to Brown Marine, copying the arbitrator, saying that they “believe there might have been a misunderstanding to our communication of yesterday, and … [were] under the impression we had indeed agreed a short extension until Friday 9 April.” These emails were not originally included in these proceedings but upon my enquiry concerning certain references made by the arbitrator on the face of the second award they were put into evidence by agreement.

</div> on which the arbitrator was copied at 1:44pm just before he received at 1:48pm the email from Brown Marine asking that he review the email exchange and make whatever order he considered appropriate. The email was in fact addressed to Brown Marine and sought to clear up any misunderstanding by explaining to Brown Marine that Fichte’s reference to not needing any further extension was to an extension beyond 9 April 2021. It was not a submission to the arbitrator concerning the making of the peremptory order. It preceded Brown Marine’s email to the arbitrator sent at 1:48pm and hence the application such as it was. Brown Marine responded to it denying any misunderstanding at 4:37pm. It is obvious that these exchanges between Brown Marine and Fichte about whether an extension of time had been agreed could not obviate the need for there to be notice of what was sought and an opportunity to submit on whether what was sought should be given. Up until the peremptory order was made there was no specific notice concerning what was sought, and in particular the sanction sought, and no opportunity for Fichte to address the arbitrator on it, including on whether there was a default at all or, if there was one, whether there had been sufficient cause for it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In these circumstances, I make three separate and cumulative findings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was in fact an agreement in substance to extend time, and there was no failure to serve the defence submissions within the time period as extended. Consequently, there was no default of the original order, and so no basis for any order to be made premised on such default.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even if there had been a default, the arbitrator failed to determine insufficiency of cause or, to put it more simply, that the default was not excusable. Thus, for this reason as well, there was no basis for any order to be made premised on a default without sufficient cause. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In any event, by failing to give the Charterer an opportunity to address him orally or in writing before making his peremptory order, including on the question of sufficiency of cause, the arbitrator acted in breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I then turn to the content of the peremptory order, namely its sanction. The sanction did not track the wording of Art 25 of the Model Law but instead barred the Charterer from raising any positive case by way of defence or counterclaim and from adducing any positive evidence in the matter. While on its face it seemed to leave open the possibility of the Charterer running a negative case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> challenging the evidence of the Owner without providing its own contrary evidence, as things turned out the arbitrator accepted the Owner’s request to proceed on a documents only basis, and did not offer the Charterer the opportunity even to respond to the Owner’s additional evidence and submissions. The sanction imposed thus operated in practice not just as a bar to a positive defence but as an effective exclusion even of a negative defence. In all the circumstances, I find that the sanction imposed by the arbitrator exceeded his powers under Art 25 of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Moving forward to 9 April 2021, the arbitrator again did not give the Charterer the opportunity to address him orally or in writing on the reasons for the short delay in communicating its defence submissions. That opportunity would have potentially included addressing him on the applicable procedural law, whether he had a discretion not to enforce the sanction, and the relevance of the absence of prejudice to the Owner arising from the short delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The arbitrator appears to have believed that he had no discretion in the matter, and that the decision on whether to allow the late submission was entirely for the Owner to make. Thus, after receiving the Charterer’s defence submissions at 11:26pm on 9 April 2021, he wrote to parties at 10:39am the next morning stating:

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I hold that the arbitrator breached natural justice in making his decision on 10 April 2021 without giving the Charterer the opportunity to be heard. Further, his view that he had no discretion in the matter and had to exclude the Charterer’s defence submissions unless the Owner agreed to their admission into evidence was wrong and did not accord with his powers under the Model Law. This error concerning his powers and how they should be exercised seems to have caused or contributed to his refusal to give the Charterer an opportunity to be heard. He perpetuated this error in his adamant assertions that he was bound to apply the sanction in his responses to Fichte’s repeated objections. Natural justice required that he consider the reasons for non-compliance and hear Fichte on the question whether he should apply the sanction notwithstanding those reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I have thus far assessed the arbitrator’s conduct by reference to the Model Law, and that is sufficient for this matter. However, even for a London-seated arbitration under the UK Arbitration Act, the arbitrator would be expected to seek input from both parties before issuing any order and would have to consider the reasons for any default. In this connection, The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, or CIArb as it is commonly referred to, has issued a helpful set of guidelines titled “Practice Guideline 14: Guidelines for Arbitrators on how to approach an application for a Peremptory and ‘Unless’ Orders and related matters” (“the Practice Guideline”). It explains how an arbitral tribunal seated in the UK should approach the issue of peremptory orders. Among the observations made in the practice guideline, two are relevant:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.1  A “peremptory order” cannot be made initially at the time of the first procedural order of the tribunal dealing with a particular procedural step. Section 41(5) contemplates three stages; namely (i) an order or direction made by the tribunal; (ii) a failure by a party to comply with that order or direction “without showing sufficient cause” and (c) that then, and only then, should the tribunal make a peremptory order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2.3 The failure to comply must be without “sufficient cause”. … This may require an arbitrator to give an opportunity to the party in apparent default to explain the reasons for its non-compliance…”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I conclude that the Charterer has succeeded in establishing that the peremptory order was made and enforced in breach of the fair hearing rule.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 While it is not necessary to my decision to consider the equal treatment rule, I also find that this was breached. The arbitrator heard the Owner but not the Charterer when fixing the original timeline for the defence submissions, and only gave the Charterer 28 days to file its defence submissions, when the Owner had taken ten months from the first award to communicate its claim submissions. How he handled timelines thereafter also did not demonstrate even-handedness between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It may be that the arbitrator had already formed the view that the Charterer did not intend to participate in the second phase of the arbitration because it did not participate in the first phase. He should not have held onto this view once it became clear that the Charterer wished to participate, as shown by the appointment of Fichte. While it may not have been expressly explained to him why there was a difference of approach between the two phases, it should in any event have been obvious to him that the first phase and first award concerned an undisputed balance due to the Owner, while the second phase concerned claims that were very much disputed. Certainly, there was no reasonable basis on which to consider that the Charterer was seeking to delay proceedings in March and April of 2021 (although, to be fair to the arbitrator, he did not make any such finding, and it has only been in these proceedings that the Owner has argued that the Charterer’s non-participation in the first phase justifies an inference that they were deliberately delaying the second phase).

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether any breach of natural justice was connected to the making of the award and caused prejudice to the Charterer </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It is obvious that the making of the peremptory order led to the arbitrator making the second award without receiving any evidence or submissions from the Charterer, not even in response to the Owner’s further and additional submissions and evidence. It is also obvious that had the arbitrator given the Charterer the opportunity to address him on whether there had as yet been any default, or whether any default was with sufficient cause, he might well have not made the peremptory order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The award on its face shows how the absence of submissions and evidence from the Charterer, all excluded by reason of the peremptory order, was connected to the making of the award: see in particular paras 26 to 42 of the second award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76  The Owner has contended that the Charterer’s failure to exhibit in these proceedings its defence submissions that were excluded by the arbitrator means that I am not able to find that their admission might have made a difference to the outcome. While the Charterer should have exhibited them for completeness, the absence from the record before me of those defence submissions does not lead to the inference that they were not material. Indeed, if they were obviously flimsy or immaterial one would imagine that the Owner would not have refused their admission into evidence when the arbitrator made it their decision and not his. I am fortified in my view that they were material by the evidence before me of Fichte repeatedly asking the arbitrator to reconsider their exclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Accordingly, I also find that the breach of natural justice prejudiced the Charterer’s rights.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The Owner invited me to remit this matter to the arbitrator under Art 34(4) of the Model Law as an alternative to setting aside. The Charterer did not agree to this course of action. I decline to exercise my power to remit. I do not exercise my discretion to remit because this is hardly a case of mere oversight in failing to give a party a reasonable opportunity to be heard on some aspect of a dispute. Rather, the peremptory order and the exclusion of the defence submissions seems to have been the product of a haste quite out of keeping with the time accorded to the Owner for its submissions. It is striking that not once did the arbitrator either ask for or consider input from the Charterer on the procedure to be adopted, the timetable to be imposed, reasons for any non-compliance or the content and application of any sanction. The Charterer’s lack of confidence in the arbitrator to decide the matter fairly if remitted is not without reasonable basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In this case, hurry (demanded of one side but not the other) has indeed buried justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I therefore grant an order setting aside the entire second award, pursuant to s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I will hear parties on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left"> Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Sing Huat, Kok Jia An Alwyn and Chia Kia Boon (Robert Wang &amp; Woo LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Bazul Ashhab, Chan Cong Yen Lionel (Chen Congren) and Chang Guo En Nicholas Winarta Chandra (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
