<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present case involves a bitter dispute
                    between the plaintiffs, Mr Ang Kim Sai (the “father”) and his
                    wife, Mdm Ang Gim Yen (the “mother”), and the defendant, their
                    youngest son, Mr Ang Kok Beng (“AKB”). The dispute concerns
                    the beneficial ownership of a property at No 206 Langsat Road, Singapore 426762
                    (the “property”), which is registered in AKB’s name. The
                    plaintiffs applied for parts of AKB’s defence to be struck out. The
                    Assistant Registrar (the “AR”) struck out most of the paragraphs
                    that the plaintiffs argued should be struck out. I dismissed AKB’s appeal
                    against the AR’s decision and now set out the reasons for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In their Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs
                    asserted that they had paid the entire purchase price of the property as well as
                    the stamp fees and legal costs incurred in the purchase of the property. As
                    such, they contended that they were at all times the beneficial owners of the
                    property although it was registered in AKB’s name in November
                1983.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It is the plaintiffs’ case that AKB knew
                    or ought to have known that the property was transferred to him to hold on trust
                    for them. They pointed out that the title deed to the property was in their
                    hands and that the property was managed by them or in accordance with their
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiffs alleged that AKB acted in breach
                    of trust by fraudulently converting the property to himself. They pointed out
                    that on 3 December 2009, AKB affirmed a statutory declaration that he had
                    lost the title deed to the property when he knew or ought to have known that the
                    title deed was in their possession. On 10 December 2009, AKB applied for a
                    replacement certificate of title to be issued to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiffs sought a declaration that AKB
                    holds the property on trust for them (the “declaration”) and an
                    order that the latter transfer the legal title to the property to
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In his Defence and Counterclaim
                    (“Defence”), AKB contended that he was the absolute legal and
                    beneficial owner of the property as his mother had told him that the property
                    was a gift to him. He sought an order that the caveat lodged against the
                    property by the plaintiffs be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiffs applied to strike out a number of
                    paragraphs in the Defence on the ground that they disclose no reasonable defence
                    and/or are scandalous, frivolous or vexatious and/or may prejudice, embarrass,
                    or delay the fair trial of the action and/or are otherwise an abuse of process
                    of Court. As has been mentioned, the AR struck out some of these paragraphs and
                    AKB appealed against the AR’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The striking out of pleadings is provided for
                    under O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed), which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be
                        struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the

                        that —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    it discloses no
                                reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    it is
                                scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>d</em>)    it is otherwise
                                an abuse of the process of the Court,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be
                        entered accordingly, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>The Osprey</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099, LP Thean JA stated at [8] that the words
                    “frivolous and vexatious” relate to actions which are
                    “obviously unsustainable” or “wrong” and added that
                    this expression also connotes “a lack of purpose or seriousness in the
                    party’s conduct of the proceedings”. In regard to what is an
                    “abuse of process”, in <em>Gabriel Peter &amp;
                        Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</em> [1997]
                    3 SLR (R) 649, the Court of Appeal explained at [22] that “this
                    term signifies that the process of the court must be used <em>bona fide</em> and properly and must not be abused”. The court
                    added that “it will prevent the judicial process from being used as a
                    means of vexation and oppression in the process of
                litigation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the present case, the controversial
                    paragraphs in the Defence that the plaintiffs sought to strike out concerned
                    their character, the father’s “second wife”, Mdm Woo Hong
                    Moi (“Mdm Woo”), and the alleged machinations of Mdm Ang Meng Hwee
                    (“Mdm Ang”), the daughter of the father and Mdm Woo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Paragraphs concerning the plaintiffs’ character</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In his Defence, AKB pleaded at paras 6-8
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">6</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As a Chinese Physician, my father travelled
                            extensively to Malaysia for his business and my mother was left entirely
                            to look after the family.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">7</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As a character, my father is very authoritative and
                            could be abusive towards my mother if his demands are not met and my
                            mother would always relent in order to keep harmony in the
                            family.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">8</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">My mother is an extremely thrifty person but has
                            good acumen in trading stocks listed among others in the Singapore and
                            Malaysia Stock Exchange and had amassed substantial sums of
                            monies.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     There was no indication in the Defence as to
                    how the authoritativeness of the father or the thriftiness of the mother had
                    anything to do with the issue of beneficial ownership of the property. The AR
                    struck out all three paragraphs. I upheld the AR’s decision to strike out
                    these paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Paragraphs concerning the father’s private life and other
                family</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In para 10 of his Defence, AKB pleaded as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After Woo Hong Moi passed away in 1979, my father brought ANG MENG HWEE to
                        stay with the family. My mother was extremely unhappy with my father’s
                        second marriage and notwithstanding ANG MENG HWEE was well-treated, she had
                        always harboured the thought that she was not regarded as a member of the
                        family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiffs asserted that para 10 of the
                    Defence was intended to embarrass them. As there is nothing in the Defence that
                    shows how the father’s second family had any connection with the legal
                    issues concerning the plaintiffs’ claim to the beneficial interest of the
                    property, I agreed with the AR that para 10 of the Defence should be struck
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Paragraphs concerning the allegations against Mdm Ang</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In his Defence, AKB also pleaded in
                    paras 21-23 that Mdm Ang had instigated his parents to institute the
                    present proceedings against him. He alleged as follows:</p>

                            further pursuit of her above desire, had even on 14.2.2010 asked my
                            parents to sign a note requesting the Defendant to sell the [p]roperty
                            so that she could have a share in the sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    The said note was purportedly signed by both the
                            Plaintiffs who by then were suffering from extreme dementia in late
                            2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     AKB’s counsel argued before the AR that
                    paras 21-23 of the Defence showed the ferocity of Mdm Ang and that she
                    masterminded the present action against his client. Whether anyone instigated
                    the plaintiffs to institute the present action had nothing to do with who is
                    entitled to the beneficial ownership of the property. Furthermore, whether or
                    not the note allegedly given by Mdm Ang to the plaintiffs to sign on
                    14 February 2010 may be set aside on the ground of the plaintiffs’
                    dementia, is not an issue in the present action. The AR understandably struck
                    out paras 21(2) and 23. In relation to para 22, he merely deleted the words
                    “in further pursuit of her above desire”. AKB had no ground to
                    complain about the AR’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Paragraphs concerning the plaintiffs’ alleged
                dementia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Apart from referring to the plaintiffs’
                    alleged dementia in para 23, AKB pleaded in para 26 of his Defence as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    The Defendant avers and will establish at the trial

                            proceedings and the alleged claims herein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiffs’ counsel insisted that

                    trial that AKB holds the property on trust for them. It is for the plaintiffs to
