However, this was incorrect. Section 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the PA states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Dissolution by expiration or notice</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">32.</span>—(1) Subject to any agreement between the partners, a partnership is dissolved —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)  if entered into for an undefined time, by any partner giving notice to the other or others of his intention to dissolve the partnership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The default position under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is that a partner has the right to dissolve the partnership by notice; he does not need the other partners’ agreement to do so. What s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) recognises is that such a right may be removed or curtailed by agreement among the partners. In the present case, the defendants did not allege, and there was no evidence of, any such agreement. Clearly, the plaintiff was entitled to dissolve the Partnership by notice, even if the defendants did not agree to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In any event, the defendants subsequently agreed that the Partnership was dissolved with effect from 31 July 2020. On 9 November 2021, the plaintiff filed Summons No 4913 of 2020 seeking summary judgment (the “O 14 SUM”). On 26 January 2021, I heard the O 14 SUM. I entered the following orders (among others) <span class="font-italic">by consent</span> of the parties (the “Consent Orders”): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Partnership has been dissolved with effect from 31 July 2020. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second defendant is: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) responsible for taking the necessary steps to wind up the business of the Partnership;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) to render an account of the financial affairs of the Partnership from 13 April 2012 to 31 July 2020; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) to deliver to the plaintiff copies of all partnership books for the same period. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The property of the Partnership is to be applied in accordance with s 39 of the PA and any surplus assets of the Partnership are to be distributed to the partners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiff proceeded with his application for summary judgment on his claims relating to the partners’ salaries (see [3(b)(iii)] and [3(c)] above).

Instead, on 24 November 2021, some 11 months after the Consent Orders were made, the defendants filed the present Summons No 5435 of 2021 (“SUM 5435) seeking:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the appointment of M/s JK Medora &amp; Co LLP (“M/s JK Medora”) as liquidator; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a stay of all further proceedings in the present action until the dissolution of the Partnership and distribution of surplus assets has concluded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The defendants exhibited a copy of the Partnership’s accounts for the period from April 2012 to July 2020 in their joint affidavit filed in support of SUM 5435.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> 1st and 2nd Defendants’ Joint Affidavit in SUM 5435, Exhibit TL-3.  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I heard SUM 5435 on 13 January 2022. The summons sought the appointment of a liquidator. However, in their submissions, the defendants sought the appointment of a liquidator <span class="font-italic">or a receiver</span> under O 30 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). The plaintiff had no objections to the defendants’ application proceeding on this basis (although they objected to the application itself) and I did so. After hearing the defendants, I dismissed their application for the reasons set out below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9  First, I rejected the defendants’ submission that the court may appoint a liquidator under s 39 of the PA. Section 39 reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Rights of partners as to application of partnership property</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">39</span>. On the dissolution of a partnership, every partner is entitled, as against the other partners in the firm, and all persons claiming through them in respect of their interests as partners, to have the property of the partnership applied in payment of the debts and liabilities of the firm, and to have the surplus assets after such payment applied in payment of what may be due to the partners, respectively, after deducting what may be due from them as partners to the firm; and for that purpose any partner or his representatives may, on the termination of the partnership, apply to the court to wind up the business and affairs of the firm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It was clear to me that I did not have the power to appoint a liquidator under s 39 of the PA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I noted that a partnership may be wound up by the court on an application under s 124(1) (which is under Part 8) read with s 246(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) (“IRDA”). Section 246(1) of the IRDA provides that any “unregistered company” may be wound up under Parts 8 and 9, which apply to an unregistered company with certain adaptations. Section 245(1) defines “unregistered company” to include “any partnership”. A liquidator would be appointed upon a winding up order being made (see s 134(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 A partner can apply to wind up a partnership under the IRDA (see s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>read with s 247(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA). However, an application to wind up a partnership under the IRDA is more likely to be made by a creditor pursuant to s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 246(1) of the IRDA since only partners can apply to dissolve the partnership under s 35 of the PA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In any event, it was clear that it is only in winding up proceedings under the IRDA that the court may appoint a liquidator. However, the defendants had not commenced any such winding up proceedings under the IRDA. There was therefore no basis for their application for a liquidator to be appointed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I would add that, in any event, winding up proceedings under s 246(1) of the IRDA seemed quite unnecessary on the facts of this case. Upon dissolution of the partnership, the right to wind up the firm vests in all of the solvent partners who may agree amongst themselves that one or more of them will act as the liquidating partner or partners: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 15 (LexisNexis, 2019 Reissue) at para 180.127. In the present case, by virtue of the Consent Orders, the plaintiff and the defendants had agreed that the second defendant was to take the necessary steps to wind up the business of the Partnership. There was no evidence that she was unable to do so. It was undisputed that the plaintiff was not involved in the running of the Partnership business. The defendants had full control of the business and had in fact prepared the accounts of the Partnership for the period stated in the Consent Orders, although she had not delivered the same to the plaintiff. There was also no allegation that the plaintiff had obstructed or could obstruct the defendants from taking steps to recover debts owing to the Partnership. It was for the second defendant to comply with the Consent Orders and deliver to the plaintiff a copy of the accounts as well as copies of the Partnership’s books. Any dispute over the accounts can be determined on the taking of the partnership accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Second, in my view, the defendants failed to show sufficient reason for the appointment of a receiver. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The defendants relied on the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Kerr on </span><span class="font-italic">the Law and Practice as to Receivers and Administrators </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th Ed, 1989) (“<span class="font-italic">Kerr</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at pp 61–62, which was quoted with approval by the High Court in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Kishinchand Bhojwani and another v Sunil Bhojwani and another </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 369 (“<span class="font-italic">Kishinchand Bhojwani</span>”) (at [7]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The readiness of the court to appoint a receiver in partnership cases depends upon whether the partnership has been dissolved at the time when the application is made. If a dissolution has clearly been effected by the service of the writ, or if the partnership has expired by effluxion of time, a receiver will readily be appointed, though the appointment is not a matter of course; it will be enough to show that one of the former partners is delaying the winding-up and realisation of the business. Conversely, if all that is shown is that a partner has retired from the partnership, leaving the remaining partners to carry on the former business, he will not be entitled to such an appointment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defendants also relied on <span class="font-italic">Hwang Ju-in v Huang Han Chao </span>[1977-1978] SLR(R) 194 (“<span class="font-italic">Hwang Ju-in</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>in which the Court of Appeal appointed a receiver because there was no co-operation between the parties and it was therefore desirable that an independent third party such as a receiver take over the affairs of the partnership, collect the book debts, prepare final accounts and thus complete the dissolution of the partnership (at [11]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 A receiver may be appointed in all cases where it is just and convenient to do so: s 4(10) of the Civil Law Act 1909 (2020 Rev Ed). Section 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (2020 Rev Ed) read with para 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the First Schedule provides that the High Court has the power to provide for the “interim preservation of property which is the subject matter of the proceedings by … the appointment of receiver …” The court may be more willing to appoint a receiver where the partnership has been dissolved then if the partnership business was still ongoing. However, in either case, a receiver will not be appointed unless there is some reason why such appointment is necessary. The central purpose of receivership is the interim preservation of disputed property pending its final resolution in the main action: <span class="font-italic">Kao Chai-Chau Linda v Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2016] 1 SLR 21 (“<span class="font-italic">Kao Chai-Chau Linda</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The passage from <span class="font-italic">Kerr</span> (see [15] above) and the decision in <span class="font-italic">Hwang Ju-in</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are consistent with the principle stated in <span class="font-italic">Kao Chai-Chau Linda</span>. There must be some reason why justice requires an independent third party to be appointed to take over the affairs and assets of a partnership. Thus, the passage from <span class="font-italic">Kerr</span> referred to former partners delaying the winding up and realisation of the business. In <span class="font-italic">Hwang Ju-in</span>, the court found that there was no co-operation between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In the present case, the defendants gave two reasons in support of their application for a receiver to be appointed. The defendants’ first reason was that the plaintiff was delaying the winding up of the affairs of the partnership. According to the defendants, the plaintiff had been uncooperative (a) <span class="font-italic">in 2012 </span>with respect to the Partnership’s bank accounts as a result of which the second defendant had to open a separate account under her name for the Partnership’s operations, and (b) <span class="font-italic">in 2013</span> when he was unwilling to sign the renewal agreement for the premises leased by the Partnership. In my view, the defendants’ submission had no merit.  The defendants could not explain how the plaintiff’s alleged conduct in 2012 and 2013 delayed the completion of the dissolution of the Partnership. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 There was no evidence that the plaintiff was delaying or obstructing the defendants from completing the dissolution of the partnership. As stated earlier (see [13] above), the plaintiff was not involved in the running of the Partnership business and the defendants had full control of the business. There was also no allegation that the plaintiff had obstructed or could obstruct the defendants from taking steps to recover debts owing to the Partnership. What the defendants had to do was to comply with the Consent Orders; disputes over the partnership accounts would be determined on a taking of the partnership accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The defendants’ second reason was that the receiver could assist them in winding up the affairs of the Partnership, including investigating the Partnership’s accounts. More specifically, the defendants submitted that the receiver would be expected to investigate the plaintiff’s claims in this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In my view, the defendants’ second reason was not a good reason for a receiver to be appointed. The receiver’s function is not to wind up a partnership but merely to preserve the assets and pay partnership debts while the court takes the usual partnership accounts and supervises the dissolution: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull SC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 30/1/14.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Further, as stated earlier, there was no reason why an independent third party had to be appointed to take over the affairs of the Partnership; the defendants had full control of the Partnership’s business and books and records. As for the plaintiff’s claims in this action, they relate to the payment of his share of partners’ salaries to his mother (see [3(c)] above) and the amount of excess partners’ salaries drawn by the second defendant (see [3(b)(iii)] above). These claims depend on whether the plaintiff had consented to the former and whether the second defendant was entitled to the latter. These issues are between the plaintiff and the defendants personally and will be determined by the court. It is unnecessary for a receiver, taking over the affairs and assets of the Partnership, to investigate these claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The reasons given by the defendants merely showed that they wished to have M/s JK Medora assist <span class="font-italic">them</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>There was nothing to prevent the defendants from engaging M/s JK Medora <span class="font-italic">to assist them</span> in preparing the accounts or even to defend the claims by the plaintiff. However, this was insufficient reason to appoint M/s JK Medora as a receiver.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I noted that the defendants were seeking a stay of all further proceedings in the present action pending the dissolution of the Partnership and distribution of surplus assets. In my view, that was a key reason for the defendants’ application to appoint a liquidator/receiver. It seemed to me that the defendants wanted to avoid having the plaintiff’s claims relating to the partners’ salaries (see [3(b)(iii)] and [3(c)] above) being determined in a trial. This view was supported by the defendants’ submission (erroneous though it may be) that the appointment of a receiver would result in the plaintiff no longer having the necessary standing to continue with his claims. In my view, it was an abuse of process for the defendants to apply for the appointment of a liquidator/receiver for this reason. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For the above reasons, I dismissed the defendants’ application and ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiff costs fixed at $2,500 inclusive of disbursements.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"> Chong Chee Keong Chris and Low Wai Cheong (Chris Chong &amp; C T Ho LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Au Thye Chuen, Carolyn Tan Beng Hui, Karuppiah Chandra Sekaran and Kuoh Hao Teng (Tan &amp; Au LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
