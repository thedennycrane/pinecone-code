<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application for summary judgment
                    pursuant to Order 14 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”), where the Purchaser sought
                    specific performance of a contract (for the sale and purchase of a Flat) entered
                    into between the Vendors and the Purchaser. The Vendors refused to perform the
                    contract. They attempted to raise triable issues based on allegations that there
                    was total failure of consideration, and that the sale and purchase agreement was
                    void. I awarded summary judgment in favour of the Purchaser. Before I state the
                    grounds of my decision, I will revisit the pertinent facts below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Undisputed Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendants in this action, M K
                    Sivalingam Jaganathan (“D1”) and Thangaveloo Thenmolee
                    (“D2”) (collectively referred to as ‘the Vendors”)
                    are the registered owners of a Housing and Development Board
                    (“HDB”) apartment addressed at Block 657 Jalan Tenaga #02-110
                    Singapore 410657 (“the Flat”). The Vendors granted the plaintiff,
                    Muharrem Unsal (“the Purchaser”) an option to purchase the Flat
                    for the price of $426,000 (“the Option”). The Option was dated
                    9 December 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, and
                    the agreed Option fee and Option exercise fee was $1,000 and $4,000
                        respectively<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. It was not disputed that
                    the Vendors signed on the Option. The stated Option expiry date was
                    23 December 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Clause 5.2 of the Option
                    provides that the Option and Acceptance signed by the Purchaser will form a
                    binding contract for the sale and purchase of the Flat (“the
                        Contract”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.
                    Notably, the Vendors and Purchaser had affirmed this clause by signing against
                        it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The Completion Date was stated
                    to be within 8 weeks from the date of the first HDB appointment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It is undisputed that the Vendors had appointed
                    HSR Property Consultant (“HSR”) as the property agency to
                    facilitate the sale and purchase of the Flat<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. One Fion Chia (“Chia”) from HSR
                    assisted the Vendors in the sale and purchase. This was confirmed by
                    Chia’s evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. It is also undisputed
                    that a HDB resale application was submitted by HSR on 11 December
                        2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> to apply for HDB
                    approval. The resale application was submitted to HDB via Chia’s email
                        address<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. In reply, HDB wrote a
                    letter to the Vendors dated 14 December 2009 to inform them that they have
                    received the HDB resale application on 12 December 2009 sent on behalf of
                    the Vendors by their housing agent (“HDB letter”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. The HDB letter informed
                    the Vendors that a HDB appointment date (being 5 March 2010) has been
                    booked by the Vendors’ housing agent. The same letter informed that a
                    technical officer will be conducting an inspection of the Flat on
                    21 December 2009 to check for any unauthorised renovation works in the
                    Flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Option granted was in the prescribed
                    standard form with a sale and purchase agreement (‘SPA’), as found
                    in the Schedule section of the Housing and Development (Agreements for Sale and
                    Purchase) Rules (Cap 129, R 11, 2004 Rev Ed) (hereinafter referred to
                    as ‘HDASPR’). The HDASPR provides that there shall be no additions
                    or variations of the SPA, non-compliance of this rule would render the SPA
                        <em>void</em>:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Vendors requested to remain in possession of
                    the Flat for another 3 months after completion to facilitate their personal
                        arrangements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. The Purchaser
                    agreed to this request and an agreement on extension of stay was entered into
                    between the Vendors and the Purchaser on 21 November 2009 (hereinafter
                    referred to as the “collateral agreement’) which allowed for the
                    Vendors to stay in the Flat for 3 months upon the completion date<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The collateral
                    agreement stated that no rent was to be charged for the duration of the extended
                        stay<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Vendors, in their attempt to discharge
                    themselves from the Option and SPA, argued that the collateral agreement is a
                        <em>variation</em> of the SPA, because Clause 19 of the
                    SPA mandates that the Flat be sold with <em>vacant
                        possession</em> on completion. The Vendors argued that, as a variation
                    of the SPA, this contravenes rule 3 of the HDASPR, which rendered the SPA
                    void under rule 4 of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Vendors further made the assertion that
                    there was a total failure of consideration as they have only received the
                    cheques for the Option fee and Option Exercise fee at as late as 14 January
                    2010. The Vendors’ solicitors wrote a letter dated 12 February
                        2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> to the
                    Purchaser, stating that Chia handed over 2 cheques to the Vendors only as late
                    as 14 January 2010, and because of this, there was no consideration for the
                    sale and purchase of the Flat. No issue was raised in this letter in relation to
                    the collateral agreement rendering the SPA void. The Purchaser’s solicitor
                    wrote a letter dated 24 February 2010 in reply asking for the Vendors to
                    confirm that they would perform their obligations under the Contract<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. There has been to
                    date no reply to this letter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Purchaser’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to the Purchaser, the Vendors were
                    “contriving means and ways to get out of the Contract”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. The Purchaser claimed that the option
                    fee was paid when the Purchaser handed over a cheque of $1,000 to the
                    Vendor’s agent, Chia, on 21 November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. Chia at that time informed the Purchaser that
                    she would pass the cheque to the Vendors. Chia gave evidence to support the
                    Purchaser’s version<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. Chia further stated that the cheque was
                    handed over to D1 soon after she had collected it from the Purchaser<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Subsequently, the Purchaser met Chia on
                    10 December 2009, where the Option <em>dated
                        9 October</em> was handed to the Purchaser <em>already signed</em> by the Vendors; this was not disputed by the
                        Vendors<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. In addition, I note
                    that the Vendors did not dispute that the signatures on the Option were made by
                    them. The Purchaser paid the Option exercise fee when he handed a cheque of
                    $4,000 to Chia on 10 December 2009. Chia again at that time informed the
                    Purchaser that she would pass the cheque to the Vendors<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.
                    This version was supported by Chia’s evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. Chia further claimed that the cheque
                    was handed over to D1 very shortly after having received the cheque from the
                    Purchaser, before the Option expiry date of 23 December 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Given the above, there was no contractual
                    basis for the Vendors to refuse to perform the Contract as shown in their
                    solicitors’ letter dated 12 February 2010; the Vendors were therefore
                    in repudiatory breach of contract and the Purchaser is seeking specific
                    performance of the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Vendors’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Vendors gave two main arguments to justify
                    their refusal to perform the Contract. The first was based on the argument that
                    the collateral agreement had varied the terms of the SPA, thus rendering the
                    latter void by way of rule 3(2) read with rule (4) of the HDASPR (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>-<a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The second argument was that there was a total
                    failure of consideration. D1 explained that the Vendors signed the Option on
                    21 November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. After D1
                    had signed the Option, he was informed by Chia that the Purchaser have not
                    handed her the Option fee<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>. D1 further
                    claims that when he received the HDB letter dated 14 December 2009, Chia
                    informed D1 that she had not received the cheques but will collect them from the
                    Purchaser soon<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. According to D1, the cheques for
                    the Option fee and Option exercise fee (at $1,000 and $4,000 respectively) were
                    received by D1 only as late as 14 January 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. D1 claims that he informed Chia on two
                    occasions that he no longer wished to sell the Flat since he did not receive the
                    cheques from Purchaser: the first occasion was in December 2009 after the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Before I proceed to review the evidence, it is
                    apposite to visit some general principles governing summary judgment relevant to
                    the decision in the present case. Some general points of guidance have been laid
                    down by the Court of Appeal in the decision of <em>Habibullah
                        Mohamed Yousuff v. Indian Bank</em> [1999] 3 SLR 650 at
                    [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under O 14 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court, summary judgment should
                        not be given where the defendant "satisfies the Court ... that there is an
                        issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried". The power to give
                        summary judgment under O 14 is <em>intended only to
                            apply to cases where there is no reasonable doubt that a plaintiff is
                            entitled to judgment, and where it is inexpedient to allow a defendant
                            to defend for mere purposes of delay</em>; <em>Jones v Stone</em> [1894] AC 122. Where a defendant
                            <em>shows</em> that he has a fair case for defence
                        or reasonable grounds for setting up a defence, or even a fair probability
                        that he has a <em>bona fide</em> defence, he ought to
                        have leave to defend; <em>Ironclad (Australia) Gold Mining Co
                            v Gardner</em> (1887) 4 TLR 18, <em>Ward v
                            Plumbley</em> (1890) 6 TLR 198.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In an application for summary judgment, the
                    plaintiff has to show that he is entitled to judgment at this stage without the
                    need to bring the matter to trial, and that it is just to deprive the defendant
                    the opportunity to ventilate, in further detail, his defence at trial. The
                    defendant has to raise triable issue(s) to show that there is sufficient cause
                    to be granted an opportunity to fully investigate the issues in a trial, and
                    that there is an acceptable basis for depriving the plaintiff of a judgment at
                    this stage. In this regard, both parties’ evidence is led by way of
                    affidavit; the plaintiff by way of Order 14 rule 2(1), (5) and (8) of the
                    Rules. The defendant is required to “show cause” in an affidavit
                    by way of Order 14 rule 2(3) read with rule 2(8) of the Rules.
                    However, just because the defendant raises contrarian assertions, it does not
                        <em>ipso facto</em> necessitate the raising of triable
                    issues; if that was the case, all the defendant has to do to ensure that the
                    matter proceeds to trial is by simply stating assertions contrary to the
                    plaintiff’s position. As Ackner LJ observed in <em>Banque de Paris et Des Pays-Bas (Suisse) SA v Costa de Naray</em>
                    [1984] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 21 (at 23):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is of course trite law that O 14 proceedings are <em>not decided by weighing the two affidavits</em>. It is
                        also trite that the <em>mere assertion</em> in an
                        affidavit of a given situation which is to be the basis of a defence does
                        not, <em>ipso facto</em>, provide leave to defend; the
                        Court must <em>look at the whole situation</em> and ask
                        itself whether the defendant has satisfied the Court that there is a fair or
                        reasonable probability of the defendant's having a real or <em>bona fide</em> defence.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Lord Ackner’s observations were endorsed
                    in <em>Prosperous Credit Pte Ltd v. Gen Hwa Franchise

                    where the High Court held at [14] that a <em>bare
                        assertion</em> was insufficient to raise a triable issue; as well as
                    in <em>Goh Chok Tong v. Chee Soon Juan</em> [2003]
                    3 SLR(R) 32 where the High Court observed at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a settled principle of law that in an application for
                        summary judgment, the defendant will not be given leave to defend based on
                        mere assertions alone: Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Suisse) SA v Costa
                        de Naray and Christopher John Walters [1984] 1 Lloyd’s
                        Rep 21 at 23. The court must be convinced that there is a reasonable
                        probability that the defendant has a real or bona fide defence in relation
                        to the issues. In this regard, the standard to be applied was
                        well-articulated by Laddie J in Microsoft Corporation v Electro-Wide Limited
                        [1997] FSR 580, where he said at 593 to 594 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]t is not sufficient just to look at each factual issue one by one
                            and to consider whether it is possible that the defendant's story in
                            relation to that issue is credible. The court <em>must
                                look at the complete account of events put forward by both the
                                plaintiff and the defendants and ... look at the whole
                                situation</em>. The mere fact that the defendants support
                            their defence by sworn evidence does not mean that the court is obliged
                                t<em>o suspend its critical faculties</em> and
                            accept that evidence as if it was probably accurate. <em>If, having regard to inconsistency with contemporaneous documents,
                                inherent implausibility and other compelling evidence, the defence
                                is not credible, the court must say so</em>. It should not let
                            the filing of evidence which surpasses belief deprive a plaintiff of its
                            entitlement to relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is clear, from the principles propounded
                    above, that the Court will not simply accept assertions stated in the respective
                    affidavits as representing the whole truth. Although the stage of summary
                    judgment is not the proper forum to make findings on the merits of the case, the
                    Court will not look at the assertions in the affidavits <em>in
                        isolation</em>, neither will the Court ignore <em>undisputed documentary and contemporaneous evidence</em>, especially
                    when they are clearly inconsistent with the assertions found in the
                    parties’ affidavits. In so far as Order 14 rule 2 requires the
                    plaintiff and the defendant to make their respective cases by way of affidavits,
                    the Court will not accept <b><em>uncritically</em></b> every fact
                    in issue raised in the affidavits. As Lord Diplock observed in the Privy Council
                    decision of <em>Eng Mee Yong v. Letchumanan</em> [1979]
                    2 MLJ 212 at 217:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although in the normal way it is not appropriate for a judge to attempt to
                        resolve conflicts of evidence on affidavit, <em>this does not
                            mean that he is bound to accept uncritically</em>, as raising a
                        dispute of fact which calls for further investigation, every statement on an
                        affidavit however equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with
                            <em>undisputed contemporary documents</em> or other
                        statements by the same deponent, or inherently improbable in itself it may
                        be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Lord Diplock’s observations have been
                    endorsed in <em>Bank Negara Malaysia v. Mohd Ismail</em>
                    [1992] 1 MLJ 400, where it was observed at 408 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under an O 14 application, the duty of a judge does not end as soon
                        as a fact is asserted by one party, and denied or disputed by the other in
                        an affidavit. Where such assertion, denial or dispute is equivocal, or
                        lacking in precision or is <em>inconsistent with undisputed
                            contemporary documents</em> or other statements by the same
                        deponent, or is inherently improbable in itself, then the judge has a duty
                        to reject such assertion or denial, thereby rendering the issue not triable.
                        In our opinion, unless this principle is adhered to, a judge is in no
                        position to exercise his discretion judicially in an O 14 application.
                        Thus, apart from identifying the issues of fact or law, the court must go
                        one step further and determine whether they are triable. This principle is
                        sometimes expressed by the statement that a complete defence need not be
                        shown. The defence set up need only show that there is a triable
                        issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As will be seen below (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>-<a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>),
                    the Vendors’ assertions in the present case are plainly contradicted by
                    the undisputed contemporaneous documentary evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The argument based on total failure of consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Vendors attempted to raise a triable issue
                    with the assertion that the Option fee and Option Exercise fee were received
                    only as late as 14 January 2010. I find this to be plainly without basis as
                    the assertion was evidently inconsistent with the undisputed documentary
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     First, the copies of cheques for $1,000 and
                    $4,000 adduced by the <em>Vendors themselves</em> show that
                    the cheques were dated 20 November 2009 and 10 December 2009
                        respectively<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>. This was entirely consistent with the
                    Purchaser’s evidence that he handed Chia the Option fee on
                    21 November 2009 and the Option exercise fee on 10 December 2009. The
                    same page showing the copies of the cheques stated “given to [D1] on
                    14 January 2010”. This is a moot point. There was no need for the
                    cheques to be handed personally to the Vendors; there was effective payment so
                    long as the cheques were handed to Chia as it was undisputed that Chia had been
                    acting as the Vendors’ agent. Any dispute between the Vendors and Chia
                    with regard to the collection of cheques is a matter for a separate suit and
                    does not concern the Purchaser. On this basis alone, it is clear that the
                    Vendors have no defence. However, since D1 has alleged that Chia informed him
                    (in November and December 2009) that the Purchaser did not pass her the
                        cheques<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>, I will
                    proceed further in reviewing the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It was undisputed that the Vendors signed the
                    Option before the Option was handed over to the Purchaser on 10 December
                    2009. This would mean that the Vendors had received the $1,000 Option Fee
                        <em>even before</em> 10 December 2009. By affixing
                    their signatures on the Option, the Vendors had represented, under the first two
                    clauses of the Option (clauses 2.1 and 2.2), that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Seller <em>has
                                received</em> the Option Fee from the Buyer.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>In consideration of the Option
                                Fee</em>, the Seller <em>grants to the
                                Buyer</em> the option to buy the Flat upon the terms set out
                            in the Option to Purchase (“Option”)</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     These two clauses are clear and unequivocal.
                    By way of clause 2.2, consideration has already been received in exchange for
                    the grant of the Option. If the Vendors had not received the Option fee before
                    10 December 2009, they would have chose not to sign on the Option.
                    Alternatively, even if the Option fee had not been collected on 21 November
                    2009, the Vendors would have instructed Chia to seek payment of the Option fee
                    from the Purchaser when the Option was handed over to the Purchaser on
                    10 December 2009, however it was not pleaded nor was it alleged in
                    D1’s affidavit that the Vendors have given Chia such
                instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Second, the fact the Purchaser and the Vendors
                    entered into the collateral agreement on 21 November 2009 is consistent
                    with the Purchaser’s version of events that the Option fee had been paid
                    on the same date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Third, it was undisputed that the HDB resale
                    application was submitted through Chia’s email address to HDB on
                    11 December 2009. This was entirely consistent with the Purchaser’s
                    version of events that the Option exercise fee was paid on 10 December
                    2009, as clause 11<b><em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></em></b> of the SPA read
                    with clause 5.1 of the Option provides for the submission of the HDB resale
                    application <b><em>after</em></b> the Option exercise fee has
                    been paid. Clause 11 of the SPA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11. Application for HDB’s approval</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Seller and Buyer will within 30 calendar days <em>from
                            the date of exercise of this Option</em>, jointly apply to the HDB
                        for its approval for the sale and purchase of the Flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Clause 5.1 of the Option explains what was
                    meant by ‘exercise’ of the Option:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.1    To <em>exercise this
                                Option</em>, the Buyer <em>must</em> do
                            all of the following on or before the Option Expiry:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    sign the “Acceptance” in this
                            Option; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    deliver the signed Option (original copy) to the
                            Seller; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>(c)</em>
                
              <em>pay the Seller $4000
                                (“Option Exercise Fee”)</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Reading both clauses together, the HDB resale
                    application would be submitted within 30 days from the exercise of the Option;
                    where the Option was exercised when payment of the Option exercise fee has
                    already been made. Indeed, the submission of the HDB resale application speaks
                    volumes; the sale and purchase application process had been carried into motion
                    when HSR submitted the HDB resale application on the Vendors’ behalf. This
                    would not have been the case if the Option exercise fee was not received. It was
                    not pleaded nor alleged (in the submissions or D1’s affidavit) that HSR
                    had acted without authority in the submission of the resale application on the
                    Vendors’ behalf. In addition, if the Option fee and Option exercise money
                    had not been received, the Vendors would have given instructions to HSR and Chia
                    not to proceed; but it was not the Vendors’ pleaded case that they had
                    given such instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Fourth, the HDB letter to the Vendors dated
                    14 December 2009 had plainly informed the Vendors that the HDB resale
                    application <em>was sent by the Vendors’ agent</em>
                    and had been received by HDB. If there had indeed been total failure of
                    consideration, or if there had been some issues with the proper authority to
                    submit the HDB resale application, the Vendors would have written a letter to
                    inform HDB to cancel the resale application or at least to inform them of such
                    issues. No such letter has been adduced. I point out that the Vendors did not
                    plead nor allege that there had been any such letter written to the HDB.
                    Likewise, HDB’s letter dated 14 December 2009 informed the Vendors of
                    the appointment date for Flat Inspection on 21 December 2009, and the
                        1<sup>st</sup> HDB appointment dated 5 March 2010.
                    Again, if indeed no consideration had been received, the Vendors would have
                    written a letter to cancel both appointments, but that was not the situation in
                    the present case. The Vendors did not state that he made any attempts to contact
                    HDB to cancel these appointments after receiving HDB’s letter dated
                    14 December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Vendors did claim however, that after they
                    have received the cheques for the Option fee and the Option exercise fee on
                        <em>14 January 2010</em>, they had informed HDB of
                    the alleged total failure of consideration. There were however, no reasons given
                    for why the Vendors had given notice to HDB only after 14 January 2010 when
                    they could have done so after they had received the HDB letter dated
                    14 December 2009. The Vendors had no evidence of any letters or
                    correspondence written to the Purchaser, or to the HDB, to raise the issue of
                    total failure of consideration or non receipt of cheques, after they have
                    already received HDB’s letter dated 14 December 2009. Indeed, if any
                    notice to the Purchaser or HDB had been given, it would have been made before
                    the Flat Inspection appointment on 21 December 2009, and not on the alleged
                    date of 14 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     D1’s assertion that he had contacted
                    Chia in November and December 2009 where Chia informed him that she had not
                    received the cheques from the Purchaser, were bare assertions unsupported by
                    documentary evidence. Neither emails nor letters have been adduced. Contrary to
                    D1’s bare assertions, and in support of the Purchaser’s version of
                    events, Chia has given evidence that she collected the Option fee and Option
                    exercise fee from the Purchaser on 21 November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> and on 10 December
                        2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Based on a review of the totality of the
                    evidence adduced, I am convinced that the Vendors have not raised any triable
                    issues. Given that the Vendors’ assertions are wholly unsupported by a
                    single substratum of evidence, and that the assertions flies against their own
                    conduct manifested in the undisputed contemporaneous documents (including the
                    cheques copies the Vendors themselves had adduced), there is plainly no defence
                    which can deny the Purchaser judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Before I conclude on the argument based on
                    total failure of consideration, I will discuss two alternative arguments which
                    have been raised by D1. These arguments can be summarily dismissed. Under the
                    first alternative argument, D1 claims that HSR was not authorised to place the
                    Option date as “9 December 2009”, and that HSR was only
                    authorised to state the Option Date as 21 November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>, which was the date when the
                    Vendors signed the Option; following from that, the Option expiry date should be
                    5 December 2009 (contrary to what was stated in the Option documentation).
                    Therefore, even if Chia had received the Option exercise fee on 10 December
                    2009, it was received too late.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I note however, that the Vendors did not
                    dispute the fact that the Option date stated on the Option was indeed
                    9 December 2009, and that the Option expiry date stated on the Option was
                    23 December 2009. Also, it was not disputed that the signatures affixed
                    below the Option date belonged to the Vendors. It was also common ground that
                    the Option was handed to the Purchaser on 10 December 2009 with <em>the Option already signed and the Option date already stated as
                        9 December 2009</em>. In this regard, I find that this is
                    essentially a simple matter. If the Vendors had signed the Option when the
                    Option date had been clearly stated as 9 December 2009, no dispute would
                    arise. If the Option date had been left blank at the time when the Vendors
                    signed the Option, the Vendors had assumed for themselves the risk that the
                    Option date will be stipulated at a later date by their own agent. If the
                    Vendors had issues with the stated Option Date and the stated Option expiry
                    date, they would have written to the Purchaser or at the very least informed
                    Chia in relation to these issues; but this was not pleaded nor alleged by the
                    Vendors. On the contrary, the Vendors’ action in submitting the HDB resale
                    application after the Option exercise money has been paid showed that there had
                    indeed been no issues with the stated Option date and Option expiry date.
                    Furthermore, I find that since the Vendors’ specific claim is that the
                    Option date was filled by HSR without authority, the proper recourse is for them
                    to claim against HSR for breach of mandate and/or for having acted without
                    authority. There is no recourse for this alleged matter against the Purchaser
                    for as far as they are concerned, they have transacted with Chia who was
                    ostensibly acting as the Vendors’ agent (it was also undisputed that Chia
                    was acting as the Vendors’ agent in the sale and purchase of the
                        Flat<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     D1’s second alternative argument was
                    that the cheque issued for the Option fee of $1,000 was issued in the name of
                    one “M K Sivalingam <em>Jajanathan</em>”,
                    when it should have been “M K Sivalingam <em>Jaganathan</em>". The Purchaser, in reply, pleaded the material facts
                    constituting estoppel and detrimental reliance<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>. I find that there is an operative
                    estoppel by convention in the present case. The Court of Appeal has, in the
                    decisions of <em>Travista Development Pte Ltd v. Tan Kim Swee
                        Augustine and others</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 at [31] and at

                    of estoppel by convention:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the basis of existing authorities, for estoppel by
                        convention to operate, the following elements must be present (see
                            [<em>Singapore Telecommunications Ltd v Starhub Cable

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)   The parties must have acted on "an assumed and
                            incorrect state of <em>fact or law</em>" [emphasis
                            added] (<em>per</em> Bingham LJ in <em>The Vistafjord</em> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)   The assumption must be either shared by both
                            parties pursuant to an agreement or something akin to an agreement, or
                            made by one party and acquiesced to by the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c)   It must be unjust or unconscionable to allow the
                            parties (or one of them) to go back on that assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It has been observed in Sir Alexander Turner,
                        <em>Spencer Bower and Turner, Estoppel By
                        Representation</em> (4<sup>th</sup> ed, 2004
                    LexisNexis) at p 180:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An estoppel by convention...is founded, not on a representation made by a
                        representor and believed by a representee, but on an agreed statement of

                        parties, as a basis of a transaction into which they are about to enter.
                        When the parties have acted in their transaction upon the assumption that a
                        given state of facts is to be accepted between them as true, then as regards
                        that transaction each will be estopped as against the other from questioning
                        the truth of the statement of facts so assumed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     These observations were cited with approval in
                        <em>Amalgamated Investment &amp; property Co Ltd (in
                        liquidation) v. Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd</em>
                    [1982] QB 84 at 126 and <em>Norwegian American Cruises
                        A/S v. Paul Mundy Ltd (The Vistaford)</em> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 343. In the present case, there is no doubt that both parties had
                    assumed that the Option fee had been paid. When the Option fee was paid by the
                    Purchaser on 21 November 2009, that had represented the beginning of the
                    sale and purchase process as well as the basis of which the Option was granted
                    to the Purchaser. On that basis, the Purchaser and Vendors entered into the
                    collateral agreement on the same date of 21 November 2009. In addition, as
                    already described above (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>-<a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>), when the Vendors had affixed their
                    signatures on the Option, it was clear to both parties that the Option fee had
                    been paid and the Option was granted to the Purchaser. This was clear from
                    clauses 2.1 and 2.2 of the Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Subsequent to the payment of the (wrongly
                    named) cheque and the affixing of the Vendors’ signature, both parties had
                    proceeded on the basis that the Option fee had been paid; the Purchaser paid the
                    Option exercise fee on 10 December 2009, thereafter, the Vendors’
                    agent submitted the HDB resale application on 11 December 2009, the
                    Vendors’ agent had also fixed the first HDB appointment on 5 March
                    2010. I note that the Vendors themselves did not realise the mistake; the issue
                    of the wrongly stated name on the cheque was not raised to the Purchaser or Chia
                    before or after the Option was exercised; nor was it raised to them or the HDB
                    after the Vendors received HDB’s letter dated 14 December 2009. It is
                    pertinent to note that even at a very late stage, when the Vendors’
                    solicitors wrote a letter dated 12 February 2010 to the Purchaser, the
                    letter made no mention of the wrongly stated name in the cheque. The issue of
                    the wrongly named cheque was only added in by way of an <em>amended</em> defence at as late as 14 July 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. Based on the objective evidence, there
                    is no doubt that both parties had proceeded in the sale and purchase on the
                    basis that the Option fee had been paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I find that it would be unconscionable to
                    allow the parties to go back on that assumption at such a late stage given that
                    the Purchaser had, on the basis that a valid sale and purchase agreement had
                    been entered into, undisputedly secured finance for the sale and purchase of the
                    Flat from Citibank Singapore Ltd and had ceased to search for alternative flats
                    to purchase<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>. These two facts were
                    not disputed by the Vendors. Furthermore, I find that there is no prejudice to
                    the Vendors if the parties are not allowed to go back on that assumption.
                    Clauses 2.1 and 2.2 of the Option could not be drafted any clearer; the Vendors
                    had the opportunity to ensure that the cheque for the Option fee was valid
                    before signing the Option. The Vendors also had more than ample time to discover
                    the mistake and to raise this issue to the Purchaser, Chia, and/or HDB at an
                    earlier time, between 21 November 2009 to January 2010 but had failed to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The argument based on the collateral agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Vendors tried to raise a second triable
                    issue with the argument that the collateral agreement (which they had requested
                    for and which has been granted for their benefit) had avoided the SPA. This
                    argument is plainly unsustainable. As will be seen below (at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>-<a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>),
                    the Vendors’ contentions can be easily dismissed with a simple reading of
                    the HDASPR and a straightforward construction of the collateral agreement. In
                    this regard, I was mindful of the decision of <em>Tokyo
                        Investment Pte Ltd and another v. Tan Chor Thing</em> [1993]
                    2 SLR(R) 467:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that a point of law or points of law were raised in an O 14
                        application did not necessarily mean that leave to defend must be given as
                        was urged upon us by the appellants: see <em>European Asian
                            Bank AG v Punjab &amp; Sind Bank (No 2)</em> [1983] 2 All
                        ER 508 at 516; [1983] 1 WLR 642 and <em>Carter
                            (RG) Ltd v Clarke</em> [1990] 2 All ER 209 at 213. To
                        our mind the answers to the legal issues raised in this appeal were clear.
                        There was no arguable defence to the respondent's claim to possession of the
                        shares. A decision on the legal issues would finally decide the rights as
                        between the parties. There was no point in granting leave to defend merely
                        on the ground that there was a triable legal issue or were several triable
                        issues of law. This was so even if the issues of law were of some
                        complexity. The High Court was correct in hearing arguments on the issues of
                        law and deciding them. To grant leave to defend in circumstances such as the
                        present would not serve any useful purpose; instead it would only cause
                        unnecessary delay, a course which the courts should certainly not
                        countenance.</p>

                        Court 1996. Order 14A, now O 14 r 12, was introduced to enable the
                        court to effect summary disposal of cases by determining any question of law
                        or construction of any document arising in any cause or matter at any stage
                        of the proceedings. This is an implement of a recent and present movement
                        towards a speedy solution to civil disputes where oral evidence is
                        unnecessary. The new procedure should be put to use in cases where all
                        relevant and necessary evidence is documentary<em>. Even in a
                            case where an application is made under O 14 r 1, if the
                            matter can be disposed of by the application of well-settled principles
                            of law, the court should not flinch from its obligation under O 14.
                            The court should take judicial notice of the law and at once grapple
                            with the issue</em>. This rule of practice is founded on the
                        following principle of practice found in The Supreme Court Practice 1999
                        para 14/4/12 headed "Questions of Law" [the same is found in para 14/4/8 of
                            <em>The Supreme Court Practice</em> 2007]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Where the court is satisfied that there are no issues of fact between
                            the parties, it would be pointless to give leave to defend on the basis
                            that there is a triable issue of law, and this is so even if the issue
                            of law is complex and highly arguable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle was applied in European Asian Bank AG v Punjab and Sind Bank
                        (No 2) [1983] 2 All ER 508; [1983] 1 WLR 642, Israel
                        Discount Bank of New York v Hadjipateras [1983] 3 All ER 129;
                        [1984] 1 WLR 137 and more recently in Stocznia Gdanska v Latvian
                        Shipping Co [1998] 1 All ER 883; [1998] 1 WLR 574, where
                        the House of Lords decided a point raised in an O 14 application. This
                        practice has been approved and applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in
                        Tokyo Investment Pte Ltd v Tan Chor Thing [1993] 2 SLR(R) 467
                        .</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I will now proceed to discuss the contentions
                    raised by the Vendors. The Vendors contended that the SPA was varied by the
                    collateral agreement, and this variation rendered the SPA void under
                    rule 3(2) read with rule 4 of the HDASPR. By way of background, it is
                    perhaps appropriate to place a short note on the general function of the HDASPR:
                    - these rules govern the sale and purchase of HDB resale transactions. Although
                    there have been no parliamentary reports on the precise policy behind these
                    rules, it has been helpfully observed in Tang &amp; Low, <em>Tan
                        Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</em>
                        (3<sup>rd</sup> ed, 2009 LexisNexis) at p 456:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In 2003, the regulation of contracts for the sale of resale HDB flats was
                        introduced via the Housing and Development (Agreements for Sale and
                        Purchase) Rules (hereinafter ‘HDASPR’). The rationale for the
                        introduction of these rules is clearly very different than those for the
                        regulation of developer sales of residential or commercial properties, where
                        the obvious concern is for the protection of purchasers who are often in a
                        considerably weaker bargaining position from unscrupulous developers. The
                        Rules that apply to HDB flats are concerned with private sales of resale
                        flats rather than direct purchases from the HDB. As such, both parties are
                        likely to be individuals of relatively equal bargaining power. Rather than
                        protect a weaker party, the objectives of the HDB rules appears to be geared
                        towards standardisation, partly to ensure compliance with the HDB’s
                        rules on eligibility to resell and/or purchase resale flats, and partly to
                        provide for fair and efficient default rules in respect of common
                        disputes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Nonetheless, there is no need to probe deeper
                    into the precise policy and purpose of these rules, as the present matter can be
                    disposed of efficaciously with a simple reading of the HDASPR and the collateral
                    agreement. I start off with the exact words of the collateral agreement, which
                    have been reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Agreement on Extension of Stay</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This agreement is made on 21 November 2009 between [the Purchaser]
                        and [D1] (seller) [i]n [<em>sic</em>] regards to the
                        matter of allowing the seller of [address of Flat] to stay within the above
                        premises for 3 months <em>upon completion date, under the
                            consent of the purchaser</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As is plainly evident from the above, this
                    agreement can only be carried out upon Completion of the SPA. If parties failed
                    to complete the SPA, there is no question of allowing the Vendors to remain in
                    possession for another 3 months. In my view, so long as <em>HDB
                        approval</em> has been obtained for the collateral agreement <em>before</em> Completion date (and thus before the collateral
                    agreement can be carried into effect), the SPA would not be void, as
                    rule 3(2) of the HDASPR allows for the variation of the SPA with <em>HDB’s authorisation</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3(2)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No agreement for sale and purchase shall contain
                            any addition to, deletion from or variation of the Form in the Schedule
                                <em>unless the</em> addition, deletion or
                                <em>variation is made with the authorisation of the
                                Board</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     There is an <em>additional</em> reason. In view that there had been <em>no consideration</em> for the extension of stay as the
                    Purchaser agreed not to charge rent for the Vendors’ extended stay in
                    possession (and as there has been no adjustment of any kind with regard to the
                    Option fee, the Option Exercise fee and the Purchase price), and in view of the
                    operative words of the collateral agreement “<em>under the
                        consent of the purchaser</em>”, I find, on a proper
                    construction of the collateral agreement, that the Purchaser had gratuitously
                    granted a <em>bare license</em> which could be revoked at
                    will at any time (at the very least) before Completion date; that is, before the
                    collateral agreement is carried out into effect; see <em>Wood v
                        Leadbitter</em> (1845) 13 M &amp; W 836 and <em>Tan Hin Leong v. Lee Teck Im</em> [2000]
                    1 SLR(R) 891 at [16] to [19]. The Purchaser had graciously given the
                    Vendors <em>permission</em> to remain in possession
                    temporarily. Nothing more was conferred. If and when the Purchaser decides to
                    revoke the bare license which is the collateral agreement before it is carried
                    into effect upon completion, (one can immediately think that an obvious reason
                    for doing so would be the Vendors’ failure to obtain HDB approval for the
                    collateral agreement), the Vendors would <em>still have delivered
                        vacant possession</em>. In that event, clause 19 of the SPA would
                    not be varied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Given the reasons in <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above, the Vendors’ refusal to
                    carry out the sale and purchase of the Flat by way of their solicitors’
                    letter dated 12 February 2010 (this was way before Completion Date which
                    was 8 weeks from 5 March 2010, the date of the first HDB appointment) is a
                    repudiatory breach of contract. There would only be a proper case to argue that
                    the collateral agreement has avoided the SPA under rule 3(2) and (4) of the
                    HDASPR <em>if</em>, at completion date, no HDB approval for
                    the collateral agreement has been obtained, and parties have carried out the
                    collateral agreement such that <em>no vacant possession was
                        delivered</em>. Clause 19 of the SPA would have been varied in such a
                    situation. In any case, I am of the view that <em>even
                        if</em> the Vendors had waited until Completion date before using the
                    collateral agreement as a reason to void the SPA, it would not necessarily deny
                    the Purchaser of any remedies whatsoever. This is because clause 15.2 of the SPA
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.2  If the <em>HDB’s approval
                                for the sale and purchase</em> of the Flat is withheld,
                            refused, revoked or <em>not obtained before the
                                Completion Date</em>, and it is <em>due to the
                                Seller’s or Buyer’s default in complying</em> with
                            the HDB’s terms of resale or <em>requirements</em>, the other party will be entitled to
                            enforce the terms of this Option for <em>specific
                                performance</em>, damages and/or any other
                        remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I find that the phrase “<em>HDB’s approval for the sale and purchase of the
                        Flat</em>” to be wide enough to encapsulate all approvals from
                    HDB necessary to facilitate the completion of the SPA and to bring the SPA into
                    effect, and this would necessarily include the HDB approval required to vary
                    Clause 19 of the SPA (as without such approval, the SPA would be void).
                    Likewise, the phrase “<em>HDB’s terms of resale or
                        requirements</em>” is broad enough to encapsulate
                    rule 3(2) of the HDASPR that requires HDB approval to vary the terms of the
                    SPA. There is no doubt that the Vendors have the burden to obtain HDB approval
                    for the collateral agreement, as they had requested for the extension of stay
                    and the agreement was made for their benefit. As such, if the Vendors failed to
                    obtain approval for the collateral agreement before the completion of the SPA,
                    the Vendors would have, pursuant to clause 15.2 of the SPA stated above,
                    defaulted in complying with rule 3(2) of the HDASPR. The Purchaser would
                    (pursuant to clause 15.2 of the SPA) have been entitled to its remedies in
                    specific performance or damages. As such, the proper course would be for the
                    Vendors to obtain HDB approval for the collateral agreement that they had
                    requested for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Given that the collateral agreement had been
                    requested by the Vendors, and the Purchaser had gratuitously (and perhaps
                    graciously) granted the 3 months extended stay for the Vendors’ benefit,
                    and without charging rent during the extended stay; it does not lie in their
                    mouth to use the collateral agreement as a convenient excuse to get out of an
                    arms-length transaction that they had entered into; indeed, by doing so, they
                    have thrown serious doubts on the <em>bona fides</em> of
                    their defence. In the final analysis, I make the point that, as long as the
                    completion date has not arrived, there is always a chance to obtain HDB approval
                    for the collateral agreement. The burden is on the Vendors to obtain HDB
                    approval before Completion, any attempt to void the SPA beforehand would be
                    premature, and in the specific context of the present case, an act lacking in
                        <em>bona fides</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Based on the evidence and the reasons given
                    above, I grant summary judgment in favour of the Purchaser and order specific
                    performance of the Contract between the Vendors and Purchaser. It is clear that
                    the collateral agreement is unenforceable until and unless the requisite
                    approval from HDB has been obtained. I make the consequential order that the
                    Vendors shall take all necessary steps to obtain the requisite approval from HDB
                    for the extension of stay in the Flat by way of the collateral agreement, one
                    week before Completion. The collateral agreement is subject to the
                    Purchaser’s power of revocation in the event of the Vendors’ failure
                    to obtain the requisite HDB approval. Accordingly, I grant OIT 1, 2 and 3. I
                    order costs to be paid by the Vendors to the Purchaser fixed at $7,000 excluding
                    reasonable disbursements. Costs for amendment of pleadings ordered to the
                    Purchaser fixed at $400 excluding reasonable disbursements.</p>
