<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal to the High Court in respect
                    of the ancillary matters in Divorce Suit No 3018 of 2011. The plaintiff wife
                    (“the Plaintiff”) and the defendant husband (“the
                    Defendant”) married on 1 October 1981. Divorce proceedings were commenced
                    by the Plaintiff on 23 June 2011 on the grounds of the Defendant’s
                    unreasonable behaviour. Interim judgment was granted on 19 March 2012. The
                    marriage lasted some 31 years. On 7 June 2013, the learned District Judge Jen
                    Koh (“the learned DJ”) delivered her decision in respect of the
                    ancillary matters. An appeal was filed by the Plaintiff on 20 June 2013 and the
                    appeal was heard by this court on 7 October 2013 and 28 November
                2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the parties, I am allowing the
                    Plaintiff’s appeal in part with the result that she is to receive 65% of
                    the net value of the matrimonial property. Details of the ancillary order, as
                    varied on appeal, are set out towards the end of the judgment. I now give the
                    reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings leading to the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       To understand the context of the current appeal,
                    a brief summary of the proceedings leading to the appeal will be helpful. I also
                    add that because the Defendant appeared as a litigant-in-person at the hearing
                    of the appeal, I have decided to set out in some detail the arguments and issues
                    that were raised by both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Divorce proceedings were commenced by the
                    Plaintiff on 23 June 2011 on the grounds of the Defendant’s
                    unreasonable behaviour. The Defendant did not contest the divorce. Interim
                    judgment was granted on 19 March 2012 with the ancillary proceedings
                    adjourned to be heard in chambers. On 7 June 2013, the learned DJ delivered her
                    decision in respect of the ancillary matters. The costs of the divorce hearing
                    were fixed at S$2,000, while the costs of the ancillary proceedings were fixed
                    at S$6,000 plus disbursements. By a letter dated 7 June 2013, the
                    Plaintiff’s solicitors claimed disbursements amounting to
                S$2,242.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The order of the learned DJ was for the
                    matrimonial property at 4B Marigold Drive, Singapore to be divided equally
                    between the parties. The Plaintiff was also given an option, exercisable within
                    30 days, to buy over the Defendant’s half-share. In the event that the
                    option was exercised, the matrimonial property was to be valued on the basis of
                    a sale in the open market less the outstanding mortgage loan. Costs and expenses
                    of the transfer and sale were to be borne by the Plaintiff. The Defendant, if so
                    required by the CPF Board, was to refund his CPF account monies used for the
                    purchase of the matrimonial property together with the accrued interest. The
                    transfer and sale of the Defendant’s half-share to the Plaintiff was to be
                    completed within 4 months of the expiry of the 30-day option
                period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the event that the Plaintiff did not exercise
                    the option, the matrimonial property was to be sold in the open market with the
                    parties having joint conduct of the sale. The net proceeds, after deducting the
                    outstanding mortgage loan and other costs and expenses, were to be apportioned
                    equally between the parties. The parties were to refund their respective CPF
                    accounts monies used for the purchase of the matrimonial property together with
                    the accrued interest, if so required by the CPF Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The order of the learned DJ was such that the
                    Plaintiff’s half-share in the matrimonial property was inclusive of her
                    claim for maintenance and that each party was to retain his/her own assets
                    without further division. Both parties also agreed that they would be jointly
                    and equally responsible for the costs and expenses of their son’s
                    education and living expenses in the United Kingdom
                        (“UK”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       An appeal was filed by the Plaintiff on 20 June
                    2013 against the whole of the learned DJ’s order, save for the order as to
                    costs. Subsequently, the Plaintiff limited her appeal to a claim for the
                    division of the matrimonial property on an 80:20 basis in her favour. In
                    addition, the Plaintiff, in her appeal, also sought maintenance as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     payment of S$140,585 as arrears of
                        maintenance; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     payment of S$163,260 as lump sum maintenance by way of deduction from the
                        sale proceeds arising from the Defendant’s half-share in the
                        matrimonial property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 11 July 2013, new solicitors were appointed
                    to represent the Plaintiff for the appeal that was fixed for hearing on 30
                    September 2013. On 7 August 2013, the Registrar granted the Plaintiff an
                    extension of time to file both the submissions and the Record of Appeal by 9
                    September 2013. At that time, the Defendant was still represented by a firm of
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 13 September 2013, the Defendant applied
                    for an extension of time to file his submissions and for the hearing to be
                    vacated and re-fixed. The application was heard by the learned Assistant
                    Registrar Teo Guan Kee (“the learned AR”) on 25 September 2013. He
                    directed that the Defendant’s application for the extension of time be
                    heard on 30 September 2013 at the commencement of the appeal. Before the learned
                    AR, counsel for the Defendant indicated that he would also be applying to
                    discharge himself on that date as the Defendant had decided to represent himself
                    and take over the conduct of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the commencement of the hearing for the
                    appeal on 30 September 2013, counsel for the Defendant applied for and was
                    granted leave to discharge himself. Under such circumstances, the Defendant, now
                    a litigant-in-person, was granted an extension of time to prepare and file his
                    submissions for the appeal. The hearing date for the appeal was re-fixed for 7
                    October 2013. The Defendant was ordered to pay costs to the Plaintiff for the 30
                    September 2013 hearing fixed at S$500. For completeness sake, it is noted that
                    at the hearing before the learned DJ, the Defendant had also applied to
                    discharge his counsel at the start of the ancillary proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On the re-fixed date of the appeal on 7
                    October 2013, the Plaintiff applied by way of Summons No 30072 of 2013 for leave
                    to admit new evidence in the form of a report with accompanying enclosures dated
                    2 October 2013 from a firm of Hong Kong solicitors. The report and its
                    enclosures concerned information in relation to the Defendant’s ownership
                    of a half-share in a flat located in Hong Kong, identified as Flat H, 4th Floor,
                    Cherry Mansion, Nos 17–39, 19A, 23A–35A and 90A Oak Street, Nos 22
                    and 22A, Cherry Street, Kowloon, Hong Kong (“the HK Property”).
                    This information had not been disclosed previously to the learned DJ and was
                    said to be relevant to the Defendant’s assets and means, and also as
                    supporting evidence for the Plaintiff’s assertions of the
                    Defendant’s failure to make full and frank disclosure. Therefore, leave
                    was granted to the Plaintiff and the hearing was adjourned to enable the
                    Defendant to file an affidavit explaining the circumstances in which he had
                    acquired the HK Property and how it had been subsequently disposed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The appeal was finally heard by this court on
                    28 November 2013. Judgment was reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The parties were married in Singapore on 1
                    October 1981. This was the Defendant’s second marriage and the
                    Plaintiff’s first marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Defendant has two children from his first
                    marriage (aged 38 and 34 years old). The parties have two children from this
                    union. The first (aged 31 years old) was born on 28 July 1982. The second child
                    of the union (aged 25 years old), the younger son, was born on 29 December 1988.
                    As at the date of the hearing before the learned DJ, the younger son was still
                    studying in the UK. Whilst all 4 children are now <em>sui
                        juris</em>, there is no dispute that they had stayed with the parties
                    during the marriage and that the Defendant’s children from his first
                    marriage were “treated and considered” as children of the marriage
                    between the Plaintiff and Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The parties were originally from Hong Kong.
                    They appear to have migrated to Singapore at the time of or shortly before their
                    marriage over 30 years ago. For the sake of completeness, it is noted that the
                    Plaintiff has stated in her affidavit that she had migrated to Singapore prior
                    to their marriage in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Apart
                    from that, there is evidence that the Plaintiff still has familial connections
                    in Hong Kong presently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The matrimonial property is a private
                    townhouse that was purchased in 2004. According to the learned DJ at [8] of the
                    Grounds of Decision (“the GD”), the matrimonial property was
                    valued by the parties at S$1.6m. There was an outstanding mortgage loan of
                    S$359,948.93 as at April 2012 and the parties agreed that the net value of the
                    matrimonial property was in the region of S$1.2m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For the 10 years prior to their moving into
                    the matrimonial property, it appears that the parties had stayed in rented
                        accommodation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff
                    asserts that she paid most of the rental expenses during that period. Where the
                    parties lived prior to that period in Singapore is not immediately
                clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     With regard to the Defendant’s history
                    of employment, the evidence set out in both parties’ affidavits
                    establishes that the Defendant had worked for substantial periods of time
                    outside of Singapore during the course of the marriage (mostly it appears, in
                    China). That said, it is noted that there is some dispute as to the duration of
                    the periods when the Defendant was working overseas. Nonetheless, what is clear
                    is that the Defendant’s last employment was as the General Manager of
                    Rigel Technology (S) Pte Ltd (“Rigel”) in Luzhou, China. The
                    Defendant also states by way of background information that he works in the
                    field of high technology manufacturing. Whilst it is clear that he has
                    significant experience in that industry, it is noted that the Defendant is now
                    63 years of age (having turned 60 in 2009). In this regard, the Defendant
                    asserts that it has been hard for him to return to the industry since his
                    resignation from Rigel in March 2012. According to his affidavit, the Defendant
                    worked overseas during the following periods:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     from November 2003 to April 2006,
                        with Celestica Electronics Ltd in Guangdong, China;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     from May 2007 to July 2010, with
                        Flextronics in Shanghai, China; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     from March 2011 to May 2012, with Rigel in Luzhou,
                        China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Defendant asserts that he was unemployed
                    and in Singapore for the periods from May 2006 to April 2007 and from August
                    2010 to February 2011. It is not entirely clear from the Defendant’s
                    affidavits as to whether he had worked overseas for other periods of
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Meanwhile, the Plaintiff has stated in her
                    affidavit that the Defendant is highly skilled and sought after in the computer,
                    semiconductor, and electronic manufacturing industry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Prior to taking up the position in

                        1987, as the Regional Manager (Asia Pacific) of National Semiconductor (Asia
                        Pacific, Regional HQ).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In summary, it is clear that during the
                    marriage, the Defendant has worked in the computer and semiconductor industries
                    and that, since 2003, he has worked for substantial periods of time in
                    China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     With regard to the Plaintiff’s history
                    of employment, it appears that prior to her migration to Singapore, the
                    Plaintiff had worked in Hong Kong, where she was able to accumulate some
                        savings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff
                    asserts that after moving to Singapore, she had used these savings to contribute
                    to the well-being of the family. The Plaintiff also states that she contributed
                    financially thereafter using her earnings from working at C &amp; May Florist,
                    selling property as an estate agent, and through multi-level marketing of
                    products such as health juices (specifically Noni-Juice and Herbal Life). The
                    Plaintiff further elaborates that she has been working as a director in Maylande
                    International Pte Ltd (“Maylande”), a company involved in the
                    beauty treatment business in Singapore and Hong Kong, for the last ten years. C
                    &amp; May Florist appears to be a florist business started by the Defendant at a
                    hotel in Singapore. The Plaintiff explains in her affidavit that she is a
                    trained florist and asserts that when the four children were young, she had to
                    work hard as a florist in Singapore while taking care of the family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Therefore, it is apparent that both parties
                    held jobs during the marriage. During the last ten years, the Defendant mostly
                    worked in China. On the other hand, the Plaintiff appears to have undertaken a
                    variety of jobs. That said, the Plaintiff has been working at Maylande during
                    the last ten years or so. According to the Plaintiff, she holds some 362,099
                    shares in Maylande, which is estimated to bear the value of S$13,040 as at 31
                    December 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff
                    explains that the finance for her various business ventures was provided by a
                    friend, Mr Chay (described as a business financier and adviser), and that her
                    present income is derived solely from Maylande.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> It also appears that the Plaintiff
                    travels to Hong Kong for work-related purposes as she states that she was
                    provided with accommodation in Hong Kong by the company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff further asserts that
                    Maylande’s business in Singapore and Hong Kong are sustaining losses
                        presently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In relation to the evidence that Maylande is
                    involved in the beauty treatment business in Singapore and Hong Kong, the
                    Defendant asserts that the Plaintiff lived an extravagant lifestyle and
                    frequently enjoyed entertaining Hong Kong celebrities and singers. In response,
                    the Plaintiff asserts that her involvement with the celebrities and singers was
                    in connection with her beauty business and that those meetings were arranged or
                    requested by her investor friends in Hong Kong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Plaintiff sets out in her affidavit a
                    detailed explanation of her involvement in Maylande.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> It appears that the
                    company was originally known under a different name and was involved in the real
                    estate agency business. The company had belonged to Mr Chay who was also at that
                    time involved in the business of exporting cut-flowers. This appears to be
                    around the time when the Plaintiff had worked as an estate agent. Subsequently,
                    after the Plaintiff was convicted for an offence relating to commissions in
                    1996, for which she spent some four months in prison from November 1996 to March
                    1997, the name of the company changed several times and it is now known as
                    “Maylande International Pte Ltd”. It appears from the
                    Plaintiff’s affidavit that Mr Chay was the party who suggested the name
                        changes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Indeed, it also appears that
                    Mr Chay was the original owner of the company and that the shares and assets had
                    been transferred to the Plaintiff for S$1. Today, Maylande is involved in the
                    business of beauty products and treatment, and has interests in both Singapore
                    and Hong Kong. The same business and financial adviser, Mr Chay, apparently
                    provided the Plaintiff with financial support in respect of her legal
                    representation when she was charged for the offence in 1996.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Whilst there is considerable dispute between
                    the parties over their respective contributions to the marriage, it is
                    noteworthy that the Defendant accepts that his financial contribution or support
                    for the Plaintiff’s business ventures was not as significant as what was
                    provided to her by Mr Chay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The precise nature of the
                    beauty treatment business run by Maylande today is unclear. The Defendant has
                    made serious allegations in his affidavit as to the legality of some of the
                    treatments offered and suggests that this may be a reason for Maylande’s
                    alleged poor earnings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>
                    Unsurprisingly, the Plaintiff has strongly denied these allegations. With regard
                    to the business in Hong Kong, the Plaintiff states that the company had a valid
                    licence since 2004 to conduct the therapy treatments in question but had to
                    re-apply for a new licence some time around 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The application was said to
                    be still pending before the Hong Kong health authorities as at the date of
                    filing of her affidavit on 29 October 2012. The Plaintiff has also claimed that
                    the Singapore company possessed a licence issued by the Health Sciences
                    Authority of Singapore and that the company had ceased the therapy treatment
                    using human placenta health tonic in 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The acrimony in the breakup of the marriage is
                    evident from the numerous affidavits filed by both parties. Numerous allegations
                    have been made by both the Plaintiff and the Defendant of the poor behaviour and
                    conduct of the other party during the marriage. One area that is stressed by the
                    Defendant is the Plaintiff’s alleged extravagant lifestyle, poor business
                    sense and consequent business losses which had placed a strain on the
                    marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     For example, the Defendant asserts in his
                    affidavit that the Plaintiff ran a business known as “New Approach
                    Entertainment” after leaving C &amp; May Florist.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> This business involved bringing in
                    singers to perform in Singapore. To this end, the Defendant exhibited an ACRA
                    report which indicated that the business was registered on 7 May 1990 and seemed
                    to have been terminated some time in 1991. In respect of this business, the
                    Defendant also asserts that he had to provide financial assistance in relation
                    to a repayment plan for some debt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In her affidavit, the Plaintiff responds that
                    New Approach Entertainment was in fact a business set up by the Defendant, who
                    had intended it to be a business vehicle for a karaoke lounge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The business was set up in
                    the Plaintiff’s name as the Defendant was under the employment of Seagate
                    and had been bound by the terms of his employment contract which did not allow
                    him to work for another business. According to the Plaintiff, this business
                    never actually started.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In summary, this court observes that this is a
                    marriage in which the Defendant spent most of his career in the computer and
                    semiconductor manufacturing industry. During the last ten years or so, his work
                    took him away from Singapore for extended periods of time. The Plaintiff, on the
                    other hand, had been involved in a number of different businesses. The first two
                    businesses, namely C &amp; May Florist and New Approach Entertainment, were said
                    to have belonged to the Defendant. It appears likely that it was around the time
                    when the Plaintiff was working as a florist that she (and possibly the
                    Defendant) became acquainted with Mr Chay, the man described as the
                    Plaintiff’s business and financial consultant. Mr Chay was involved in the
                    real estate business as well as that of cut-flower trade. After leaving C &amp;
                    May Florist, the Plaintiff, with the assistance of Mr Chay, worked as an estate
                    agent and subsequently in the beauty treatment business over the past 10 years
                    or so. It appears that the beauty treatment business in Maylande spans across
                    both Hong Kong and Singapore. The extent to which the Defendant had assisted the
                    Plaintiff in her business ventures is unclear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Both parties have made allegations concerning
                    the poor behaviour of the other spouse during the marriage. For example, the
                    Plaintiff complains that the Defendant had a mistress overseas and that he had
                    not been truthful about his job prospects and assets overseas. The Defendant, on
                    the other hand, has made many assertions relating to the Plaintiff’s
                    extravagant lifestyle, her incurrence of excessive renovation expenses and the
                    strain on the family caused by her business or employment ventures. Both parties
                    claim to be caring and loving parents. It is particularly sad that both parties
                    have found it necessary to submit affidavits which make references to the
                    children in attempts to make good on their respective assertions. Both parties
                    have alleged that there has been a lack of candour and proper disclosure of
                    material facts relevant to the assessment of the other party’s financial
                    assets and resources. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, for the purpose of this
                    appeal, the Plaintiff was granted leave to submit a new affidavit exhibiting a
                    report from a firm of Hong Kong solicitors revealing a previously undisclosed
                    inheritance of the Defendant. More will be said on this later in this
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings of the District Court and the views of the High
                Court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Direct contributions towards the purchase price of the matrimonial
                property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The matrimonial property was valued by the
                    parties at S$1.6 million. There was an outstanding mortgage of S$359,948.93 as
                    at April 2012. On this basis, the parties agreed before the learned DJ that the
                    net value of the matrimonial property was in the region of S$1.2
                million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The parties did not dispute the initial cash
                    payments or the CPF payments made towards the purchase of the matrimonial
                    property. The main dispute here concerned the extent to which the Plaintiff had
                    contributed to the mortgage repayments. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant
                    stopped making mortgage repayments since October 2007 and that the monthly
                    repayments were paid by the Plaintiff from that time onwards.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> There is also a dispute as to whether
                    the monies remitted by the Defendant to the Plaintiff whilst he was working in
                    China were meant for the mortgage repayments as opposed to the other household
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     After reviewing the affidavits and submissions
                    of both parties, the learned DJ preferred the evidence of the Defendant to that
                    of the Plaintiff. At [20] of the GD, the learned DJ accepted that between 2007
                    and 2010, the Defendant had remitted monies for the payment of the monthly
                    mortgage instalments. The Defendant’s claim was found to be supported by a
                    sampling of the bank statements and emails provided by him. On the other hand,
                    the learned DJ found that the Plaintiff was unable to produce any documentary
                    evidence to support her claim of having made some of the mortgage repayments
                    during this period. The learned DJ noted at [10] of the GD that the Plaintiff
                    had accepted that between December 2007 and April 2010, she did receive
                    remittances from the Defendant totalling S$86,340. However, the Plaintiff claims
                    that these monies were meant for general household expenses as well as for the
                    payment of the Pinetree Club membership fees. Notwithstanding this, the learned
                    DJ found that the monies remitted on a monthly basis were intended for the
                    mortgage repayments and that if the Plaintiff chose to apply those sums for some
                    other purpose, such as to pay the Pinetree Club membership fees, that would be
                    at her own prerogative. In arriving at this conclusion, the learned DJ rightly
                    pointed out that it was telling that the amounts remitted by the Defendant each
                    month during the period from 2007 to 2010 matched the amount required for the
                    monthly mortgage instalment of S$2,700. That said, the learned DJ accepted that
                    any monies remitted in excess of S$2,700 each month should not be computed as
                    part of the Defendant’s direct contributions to the purchase of the
                    matrimonial property. Instead, these were to be regarded as his contributions
                    towards the general household and family expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     After reviewing the affidavits and submissions
                    in this appeal, I am of the view that the learned DJ’s finding in respect
                    of the mortgage repayments between 2007 and 2010 is correct. I would also add
                    that during this period of time, the Defendant was working in China and it is
                    apparent that any benefit arising from the Pinetree Club membership must have
                    been intended for his family in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At [23] of the GD, the learned DJ assessed
                    that the Defendant had contributed S$2,700 a month towards the mortgage
                    repayments for the period from October 2007 to December 2010, giving rise to a
                    total contribution of S$105,300. The learned DJ also rightly noted that the
                    Plaintiff had paid the mortgage instalments of S$2,700 a month from January 2011
                    (when the Defendant had returned to Singapore from China) to April 2013 (when
                    the hearing before the learned DJ commenced), giving rise to a total
                    contribution of S$75,600. On this basis, taking into account the CPF
                    contributions as well as the initial payments made by the parties, the direct

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contributions towards renovation and maintenance of the matrimonial
                property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Evidence provided by both parties in their
                    respective affidavits on either party’s contributions towards the
                    renovation and maintenance of the matrimonial property were sharply conflicting.
                    According to the Plaintiff, she incurred the sum of S$129,788.70 in respect of
                    the maintenance and renovation of the matrimonial property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> This sum was disputed by the
                    Defendant, who asserted that the Plaintiff’s contributions only amounted
                    to some S$64,645. However, it bears noting that the real basis for the
                    Defendant’s persistent objection appears to be that the sums were spent
                    without his consent and were, in his view, largely a waste of money. Some of her
                    claims were also said to relate to a rented apartment. The learned DJ noted that
                    the Defendant’s claim to have spent some S$20,000 on renovation was denied
                    by the Plaintiff and that ultimately, neither party was able to produce any
                    documentary evidence in support of their respective renovation
                claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The fact that neither party produced
                    documentary evidence to support their claims for the renovation expenses, whilst
                    important, does not necessarily mean that this court must conclude that the
                    Plaintiff did not make any contributions towards the renovation and maintenance
                    of the matrimonial property or the rented flat. After all, it is accepted that a
                    detailed accounting of financial contributions is difficult, if not impossible,
                    in many cases. This is especially so where the marriage has been a long one and
                    where the sums were incurred over an extended period of time. The Defendant does
                    not, in any case, deny that the Plaintiff did spend monies for the purposes of
                    renovation and maintenance and, whilst he may be of the view that some of the
                    sums were extravagant or unnecessary, the fact remains that the Plaintiff does
                    appear to have made a substantial contribution of at least S$64,645 or possibly
                    even more. Even if it is accepted that the Defendant paid some S$20,000 towards
                    the renovation and maintenance of the matrimonial property, it seems clear that
                    the Plaintiff, on the whole, had made larger contributions in this area. This is
                    a factor which the court is entitled to take into account as part of the overall
                    matrix of factors in determining the appropriate division of the matrimonial
                    property. This court agrees with the learned DJ that both parties are likely to
                    have made financial contributions towards the improvement and maintenance of the
                    matrimonial property. That said, whilst it is not feasible to work out the exact
                    figures, it is more likely that the Plaintiff’s contributions in this area
                    were higher than that of the Defendant’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other financial contributions towards household expenses not directly
                attributable to the mortgage of the matrimonial property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     These comprise contributions towards property
                    tax, management fees, home insurance and electricity bills. Unsurprisingly, the
                    evidence and assertions in both parties’ affidavits were conflicting. In
                    her written submissions, the Plaintiff makes references to her claim of having
                    spent monies on property tax, insurance and some S$39,965 towards paying utility
                    bills. In addition, the Plaintiff also claims to have paid all rental expenses
                    of the family’s rented accommodation prior to their moving into the
                    matrimonial property. Whilst no figures or documentary proof has been provided,
                    it is noted that the Defendant does not appear to dispute her claim of having
                    paid the rental expenses. Whilst the learned DJ rightly concluded that both
                    parties are likely to have made financial contributions towards the payment of
                    property tax, insurance and utility bills for the matrimonial property, this
                    court notes that some recognition ought to be given to the fact that the
                    Plaintiff appears to have paid the rental expenses for some time prior to their
                    moving into the matrimonial property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-financial contributions: Care of the family </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     At [35] of the GD, the learned DJ found that
                    the length of marriage was long and that both parties had played their part in
                    terms of non-financial contributions to the marriage. It is noted that both
                    parties have made allegations in respect of the other’s conduct and
                    relationship with the children, which is unfortunate and unhelpful. This court
                    does not find it necessary to further comment on how the parties discharged
                    their parental duties or on their relationships with the children. However, it
                    is noted that the Defendant had spent long periods of time away from Singapore,
                    during which the Plaintiff would have been effectively in charge of the
                    day-to-day running of the household. That said, it is clear that the Defendant
                    had travelled overseas for work-related purposes and that he did remit monies
                    back to Singapore while he was based overseas.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiff’s Assets and Means</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Plaintiff is 61 years of age. In her
                    Affidavit of Assets and Means, she describes her occupation as a
                    “business woman”, by which she was referring to her employment and
                    interest in Maylande. The Plaintiff discloses her monthly gross income as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>

                        2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     She also declared her ownership of shares in
                    Maylande which had an estimated value of S$13,040 as at December 2009. With
                    regard to her CPF account, the Plaintiff declared that, as at December 2011, she
                        had:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     S$1,361.88 in her Ordinary

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     S$72.04 in her Special Account; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     S$2,327.04 in her Medisave Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Plaintiff also declared two bank accounts
                    which are solely in her name:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     UOB: S$1,661.52 as at 29 February
                        2012; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     POSB:
                        S$3,969.82 as at 10 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In addition, the Plaintiff declared her
                    interest in a car under hire purchase with an estimated value of S$90,000 as at
                    30 April 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Against this, the Plaintiff also disclosed
                    debts owing to Mr Chay, some banks and other individuals. These
                        include:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     S$137,063 to Mr
                    Chay;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     S$74,793 to
                        Nassau Pte Ltd; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     S$103,800 to Maybank in respect of a car loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Plaintiff declared her monthly expenses to
                    be S$10,685 pre-divorce and S$12,935 post-divorce.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> At [41] of the GD, the learned DJ observed
                    that both sets of expenses took into account the costs and expenses of the
                    younger son’s education in the UK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On appeal, the Plaintiff asserts that the
                    learned DJ erred in concluding at [39] of the GD that her average gross monthly
                    salary ranged from S$1,400 to S$4,166. This is said to be important because the
                    learned DJ went on to state at [50] that the Plaintiff must have had other
                    sources of income given that her declared monthly expenses far exceeded her
                    declared average gross monthly income. Whilst the Plaintiff has stated that Mr
                    Chay had provided her with financial assistance, there was no concrete evidence
                    to support that claim. Indeed, the learned DJ questioned the Plaintiff’s
                    ability to meet the monthly mortgage instalments of S$2,700 from January 2011 to
                    April 2013. In her written submissions, the Plaintiff asserts that the learned
                    DJ’s finding that the Plaintiff had under-declared her income was
                    incorrect since the figure of S$1,416.66 was only for the year of 2011. In other
                    years, her declared income was relatively higher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     After reviewing the affidavits and submissions
                    of both parties, this court agrees with the general thrust of the learned
                    DJ’s decision on the Plaintiff’s declared gross monthly income as
                    compared to her asserted monthly expenses. Even if her actual gross monthly
                    income was higher, and working on the basis of the average figure of S$3,142 per
                    month as suggested by the Plaintiff’s counsel, there is still a
                    significant gap between the Plaintiff’s monthly income and her asserted
                    monthly expenses. In this regard, the Plaintiff naturally asserts that she was
                    able to make up the difference by means of financial assistance from Mr Chay and
                    that her declared expenses had not been inflated. Whilst much has been said by
                    the parties of the Plaintiff’s relationship with Mr Chay and his financial
                    support to her over the many years, it is unclear as to the nature of the
                    relationship and whether the monies provided by Mr Chay, in whole or in part,
                    were loans that have to be repaid. That said, it is noted that the Plaintiff has
                    exhibited some documents relating to the “friendly loans” made by
                    Mr Chay. Regardless of this, it is clear that the relationship between Mr Chay
                    and the Plaintiff is a longstanding one whereby he had provided financial
                    support, whether as loans or otherwise, and business advice to the Plaintiff
                    over the years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The Plaintiff also asserts that the learned DJ
                    erred in reducing her estimated monthly expenses post-divorce from S$12,935 to
                    S$1,520 at [52] of the GD. For convenience sake, the Plaintiff’s estimate
                    and the learned DJ’s assessment (in table form) are set out below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     After considering the parties’
                    submissions, this court agrees with the learned DJ’s finding that the
                    mortgage repayment should not be included as a long-term expense given that the
                    court intends to order the division and sale of the matrimonial property. As for
                    the claim in respect of the son’s expenses in UK, the learned DJ was right
                    to point out that the Defendant was also responsible for paying half of the fees
                    and expenses incurred. Since the parties have agreed that they would be jointly
                    and equally responsible for the son’s expenses, it would not be right to
                    include her half-share as part of her expenses in terms of assessing the
                    division of matrimonial assets and an appropriate maintenance order. As for the
                    Plaintiff’s other expenses, it is noted in particular that the learned DJ
                    reduced those in relation to the car, food and the maid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The assessment of these expenses as part of
                    the Plaintiff’s financial needs is guided by the factors set out in s
                    114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”).
                    In particular, regard must be had to the standard of living enjoyed by the
                    family before the breakdown of the marriage as well as the achievement of what
                    is just and equitable, insofar as it is practicable, to place the parties in the
                    financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken
                    down (see s 114(2) of the WC). In these circumstances, I am of the view that a
                    reasonable assessment of the expenses for transport and food is in the region of
                    S$1,000 for each item. In short, this court agrees that the learned DJ’s
                    estimate of the Plaintiff’s monthly expenses was on the lower end of the
                    scale and that a reasonable global estimate would be closer to
                S$3,500.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Nevertheless, this court notes the earlier
                    point that the Plaintiff’s earnings, whilst variable, is higher than the
                    learned DJ’s estimate of S$1,416 per month and probably much closer to
                    S$3,000 a month. Whilst her declared monthly expenses still far exceed the
                    higher estimate of her average gross monthly income (based on what she has
                    disclosed), the point is that in this court’s estimation, her average
                    monthly earnings are not far off the court’s estimate of her reasonable
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s Assets and Means</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As at the date of the hearing before the
                    learned DJ, the Defendant had resigned from his employment with Rigel. He is
                    currently unemployed. The Defendant asserts that at his current age of 63 years
                    old, it would be difficult for him to find re-employment in the technology
                    industry and that his attempts to find new employment have not been successful
                    thus far. Prior to his resignation on 5 March 2012, his declared monthly
                    take-home income, including salary, allowances, commissions and bonuses, was
                        S$6,624.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The
                    Defendant declared that he had no other sources of income and his only immovable
                    property (in Singapore and overseas) was the matrimonial property in Singapore
                    held in the joint names of both parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> He stated that he does not own a car or any
                    shares, whether in Singapore or overseas. The Defendant declared 2 bank accounts
                    which are solely in his name:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     POSB: S$986 as at 23 April 2012;
                        and</p>

                        Bank: HK$6,162 as at 23 April 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As regards his CPF account, the Defendant
                    states that, as at 23 April 2012, he had:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     S$1,762 in his Ordinary
                        Account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     S$548
                        in his Special Account; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_c"></a>(c)     S$35,342 in his Medisave Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Defendant further disclosed that the
                    principal sum of S$231,513.79, with an accrued interest of S$41,301, had been
                    withdrawn from his CPF account to meet the purchase of the matrimonial
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Defendant also declared 3 insurance
                    policies in his name:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     Prudential (Prusave), with an
                        insured amount of S$45,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     Prudential (Prushield), which is a hospitalisation
                        insurance; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     Prudential (Prushield Extra), which is a rider for the Prushield
                        policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In particular, the Defendant stated that he
                    was unsure if there was any surrender value for Prusave. However, the Defendant
                    went on to estimate the surrender value for Prusave as being less than
                        S$10,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> There was no
                    surrender value disclosed for Prushield.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Insofar as his debts and liabilities are
                    concerned, the Defendant declared a number of Hong Kong dollar denominated debts
                    owing to Citibank, Bank of China, Development Bank of Singapore (Hong Kong) and
                    UA Finance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> These totalled
                    some HK$315,389. The Defendant also declared that his income tax liability in
                    Singapore was yet to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     At [45] of the GD, the learned DJ noted that
                    the Defendant’s claimed expenses amounted to S$4,650 per month. Unlike the
                    Plaintiff, the Defendant did not include payments that he was making towards
                    their son’s education in the UK. Given that he is unemployed, the
                    Defendant explained that he has been meeting these expenses through loans from
                    family members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In this appeal, the Plaintiff has made many
                    allegations in respect of the Defendant’s failure to provide full
                    disclosure of his assets and means. In particular, she alleges that he likely
                    possessed other assets in China given his many years of work there. The
                    Plaintiff also suggests that the Defendant’s resignation from Rigel was
                    “contrived” and that, in all likelihood, the Defendant intends to
                    leave Singapore for China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As regards the allegation that the Defendant
                    contrived to resign from Rigel in 2012, the learned DJ concluded that there was
                    no basis for the Plaintiff’s allegation. This court agrees and makes no
                    further comment on this point. It is also of no use to speculate on whether the
                    Defendant might choose to return to China in the future. In the event that he
                    chooses to do so, it would most certainly be within his right to do so. Whether
                    the Defendant is able to find similar work in China, Hong Kong or elsewhere at
                    his current age is not something which this court is able to make any definitive
                    assessment of. Having said that, this court sees no reason to disturb the
                    learned DJ’s finding at [51] of the GD that it will likely be difficult
                    for him, at his current age, to secure employment with a comparable income as
                    before.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In addition, much has been said by the
                    Plaintiff in relation to her allegation that the Defendant had withdrawn
                    substantial amounts from his CPF account when he turned 55 and that further
                    amounts were withdrawn when he turned 60 in 2009. In the Plaintiff’s view,
                    this meant that S$111,009.46 was not accounted for in the Defendant’s
                    Affidavit of Assets and Means. However, the learned DJ noted at [48] of the GD,
                    that the Defendant had disclosed the withdrawal of sums from his CPF account
                    when he turned 55 in 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> and that an explanation was also provided as
                    to how the monies were used for mortgage payments and other
                        expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Defendant
                    also denied making any further withdrawals when he turned 60 and that the sum of
                    S$111,009.46 was nothing more than the consolidated amount for un-posted
                    transactions in his POSB account accumulated over the years when he did not
                    update his passbook as he was away in China. In these circumstances, I see no
                    reason to disturb the finding of the learned DJ, at [57] and [58] of the GD,
                    that the Defendant has provided adequate disclosure and explanation with regard
                    to his CPF funds. In particular, it is noted that the Plaintiff’s
                    assertion that the Defendant did not disclose S$62,200 in his CPF investment
                    account was rejected given that the CPF Board had explained that the sum did not
                    indicate that he held any investment holdings or made any profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-disclosure of inheritance by Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I turn now to the general allegation that the
                    Defendant has other undisclosed assets in China. Taking into account the
                    assertions by the parties, the learned DJ concluded at [59] of the GD that the
                    allegation was unproven and that cogent evidence was required to substantiate
                    the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As mentioned earlier in this judgment, the
                    Plaintiff applied for leave shortly before the start of the hearing of the
                    appeal to admit new evidence in the form of a report and its accompanying
                    enclosures from her Hong Kong solicitors. The report and its accompanying
                    enclosures state that the Defendant received a half-share of the HK Property on
                    19 August 2011 pursuant to his mother’s will. The half-share was sold on
                    30 March 2012 to the Defendant’s niece and her husband for HK$950,000.
                    This information had not been disclosed previously by the Defendant. In these
                    circumstances, leave was granted to the Plaintiff to admit this evidence and the
                    hearing was adjourned to enable the Defendant to file an affidavit explaining
                    the circumstances in which he had acquired the HK Property and how it had been
                    subsequently disposed. What follows is a brief explanation as to why leave was
                    granted, followed by a consideration of the impact of the new
                evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The law on admission of new evidence on an
                    appeal from the District Court to a High Court judge in chambers on ancillary
                    matters was discussed at length by Woo Bih Li J in <em>ACU v
                        ACR</em> [2011] 1 SLR 1235 (“<em>ACU v
                        ACR</em>”). In that case, the District Court had granted the
                    husband care and control of the children with access on terms for the wife. One
                    factor underlying the decision on care and control was that the wife, who had
                    been diagnosed as suffering from reactive depression, had previously threatened
                    to commit suicide with the children. At the appeal, the wife’s counsel
                    sought leave to adduce fresh evidence, including a psychiatrist report stating
                    that she was not suffering from a psychiatric condition that would prevent her
                    from caring for the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In this regard, the power of the court to
                    admit fresh evidence on appeal is generally governed by the rule set out in
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> [1954] 1 WLR 1489
                        (“<em>Ladd v Marshall</em>”). The rule is
                    well-known and comprises three cumulative conditions. First, that the evidence
                    could not have been obtained with reasonable due diligence for use at trial.
                    Second, the evidence must be such that if leave were granted, it would probably
                    have an important influence (without necessarily being decisive) on the result
                    of the case. Third, the evidence much be such that it is presumably to be
                    believed, or in other words, the evidence is apparently credible though it need
                    not be incontrovertible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The question as to whether the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> rule applies to an appeal from the
                    District Court to a High Court judge in chambers was considered and qualified by
                    the Court of Appeal in its decision of <em>Lian Soon Construction
                        Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053
                        (“<em>Lian Soon Construction</em>”).
                    Since an appeal to the High Court judge in chambers is by way of a re-hearing,
                    it followed that in such cases, the judge possesses the discretion to admit
                    fresh evidence even in the absence of special reasons. Even though an appeal to
                    the Court of Appeal is also by way of a re-hearing, O 57 r 13(2) of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) specifically provides that in the case of an
                    appeal from a judgment after trial or a hearing on the merits of a case, further
                    evidence is not to be admitted except on special grounds. These special grounds
                    are essentially those set out in <em>Ladd v
                    Marshall</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In <em>ACU v ACR</em>,
                    Woo J noted that in the context of appeals from a Registrar to a High Court
                    judge in chambers (<em>ie</em>, Registrar’s Appeals),
                        <em>Lian Soon Construction</em> was decided on the
                    basis that Registrar’s Appeals were not governed by O 57 r 13(2). In the
                    case of appeals from the District Court to a High Court judge in chambers, Woo J
                    noted that the position was the same—there was no express rule prescribing
                    the need for special conditions to be met for the admission of further evidence.
                    Therefore, it is clear that this court, in the present appeal, possesses the
                    discretion to admit fresh evidence. That said, even though a High Court judge in
                    chambers is not bound by the rule in <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em>, there is no reason why the three limbs of the rule
                    cannot be referred to as a starting point in guiding the exercise of the
                    discretion. Nonetheless, it is clear from <em>ACU v
                        ACR</em> that even if the first limb is not met, the judge may still
                    exercise his discretion to admit fresh evidence especially if the second and
                    third limbs appear to have been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In the present appeal, the evidence that the
                    Defendant received a half-share of the HK Property by way of inheritance is a
                    matter which is relevant to the overall assessment of his assets and means. The
                    evidence was credible, especially given that the inheritance and sale were
                    admitted by the Defendant. Even though the Plaintiff might have been able to
                    discover the inheritance earlier, I decided to allow the new evidence to be
                    admitted. This included both the report from the Hong Kong solicitors and the
                    accompanying enclosures from the Hong Kong Land Registry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The report establishes that the Defendant
                    received a half-share of the HK Property on 19 August 2011, which was also
                    confirmed by the Defendant himself. Divorce proceedings in this case, it will be
                    recalled, had been commenced by the Plaintiff on 23 June 2011. Interim Judgment
                    was granted on 19 March 2012. On 30 March 2012, the Defendant sold the HK
                    Property for HK$950,000. This was shortly after Interim Judgment had been
                    granted and some time before the ancillary proceedings, which is the matter on
                    appeal before this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Plaintiff has asserted that the
                    Defendant’s half-share was sold at a considerable undervalue. This was
                    because a property valuer in Hong Kong estimated the value of the HK Property on
                    30 March 2012 as being in the region of HK$2.83m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> In her oral
                    submissions at the appeal hearing, the Plaintiff also suggested that the
                    Defendant would have known that he was selling his share at an undervalue, that
                    the sale price was unreliable and that there was no proper or satisfactory
                    account of what had happened to the sale proceeds that he
                received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Defendant filed an affidavit dated 18
                    October 2013 setting out his explanation of the inheritance and subsequent
                    disposal of the sale proceeds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> The
                    Defendant explained that the HK Property was an inheritance left by his mother
                    to both his elder brother and him in equal shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In a nutshell, the reason proffered
                    by the Defendant as to why he did not disclose the inheritance was that his
                    mother had expressed her firm wishes that the property was not to be given to
                    the Plaintiff on account of her “extreme bad behaviour” towards
                    the Defendant and his family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> As such, the Defendant felt morally
                    obligated to carry out his mother’s wishes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The date of the actual conveyance of the HK
                    Property was on 30 March 2012. However, the Defendant exhibited in the affidavit
                    a sale and purchase agreement in Chinese apparently signed on 21 August 2011 by
                    the Defendant, his niece and her husband for the sale of his half-share and
                    payment by an instalment plan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In his affidavit, the Defendant explains that
                    he sold his half-share in August 2011 as he was already finding it hard to meet
                    his financial commitments and responsibilities. These included the son’s
                    school fees in the UK, wedding expenses for his second daughter’s wedding
                    in July 2013, credit card payments and personal living expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The Defendant
                    asserts that he had no other source of funds as he was already in debt to his
                    elder brother. He also explains that he wished to help his niece who had just
                    gotten married and who was finding it difficult to acquire a home. To this end,
                    the sale and purchase agreement dated 21 August 2013 was exhibited in his
                        affidavit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Unfortunately, the document is in Chinese
                    and no certified translation has been provided by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Nonetheless, at the hearing before me in
                    chambers, parties did not seem to take any issue with the essential contents of
                    the sale and purchase agreement—that is, the Defendant’s half-share
                    would be sold to his niece and her husband with payment of the sale price on an
                    instalment basis over a 10-year period. In this regard, the Plaintiff’s
                    counsel objected to the Defendant’s submission on this point. However,
                    whilst I am reminded of the important principle that evidence should not be
                    given from the Bar, this court does have exhibits in the Defendant’s
                    Affidavit for Appeal Hearing (“DA-R”) supporting the sale on a
                    10-year instalment plan basis. These comprised some emails between the Defendant
                    and his niece, which indicated that there was a balance sum of HK$529,000 owing
                    to the Defendant as at October 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As mentioned earlier, the Plaintiff disputes
                    the Defendant’s explanation set out in DA-R. In her affidavit in reply,
                    she maintains that she had a good relationship with her mother-in-law. In
                    particular, the Plaintiff noted that the Defendant did not produce the will or
                    any other documentary evidence to support his statement that his mother did not
                    wish the Plaintiff to have any share in the HK Property. She also disputed the
                    genuineness of the sale and purchase agreement, the instalment plan and the
                    Defendant’s explanation of why the sale was necessary in light of his
                    alleged expenses and financial commitments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Whilst the details and circumstances are very
                    much in dispute, it is clear that the Defendant did indeed receive a half-share
                    of the HK Property on 19 August 2011. This was not disclosed in the proceedings
                    below. Further, even if I accepted the Defendant’s explanation in relation
                    to this non-disclosure, it appears that the niece and her husband still owe the
                    Defendant some HK$529,000 in respect of the sale price.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> This was also
                    not disclosed by the Defendant in the proceedings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Drawing of adverse inferences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that even
                    if the Defendant’s mother had expressed the wish that the Plaintiff be
                    excluded from the inheritance, this did not excuse the Defendant from fulfilling
                    his duty of full and frank disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     This court agrees with that submission. The
                    Defendant’s half-share would, at the very least, be relevant to
                    ascertaining his assets and means. Even if the inheritance was not a matrimonial
                    asset, it was still relevant as a component of his overall financial position at
                    the time of the divorce. Indeed, it is noted that the Defendant stated at the
                    hearing of the appeal that he knew that he should have made the disclosure but
                    did not do so as a result of the moral pressure that he was labouring under.
                    Section 112(10) of the WC defines “matrimonial asset” as including
                    “any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party
                    or both parties to the marriage”. However, this does not include
                    “any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one
                    party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially
                    improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the
                    marriage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Even though the half-share of the HK Property
                    was unlikely to be a matrimonial asset, it may still be relevant to the court
                    when determining how to divide the other matrimonial assets between the parties.
                    Section 112(2) of the WC sets out a broad non-exclusive range of factors to be
                    taken into account in determining a fair and equitable division of matrimonial
                    assets. Factors referred to in s 114(1) should also be taken into account if
                    they are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Section 114(1) of the WC directs the Court, in
                    assessing maintenance, to have regard to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the “income, earning capacity, property and other
                    financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely
                    to have in the foreseeable future”. It follows that the Defendant’s
                    half-share in the HK Property ought to have been disclosed as a factor relevant
                    to the assessment of the Plaintiff’s maintenance, and the division of the
                    parties’ matrimonial assets. To be clear, this court is not laying down a
                    principle that in all cases, factors relevant to maintenance are
                    “automatically” relevant in assessing what is an appropriate
                    division of matrimonial assets. Rather, the relevance of any one factor and the
                    weight to be ascribed to it will depend on the circumstances of each
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Leaving aside the relevance of the HK Property
                    as a component of the Defendant’s assets and means, the Plaintiff also
                    made a point that the Defendant’s non-disclosure was a ground which
                    supports her submission that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the
                    Defendant in assessing the division of the matrimonial assets and her
                    maintenance. It will be recalled that the learned DJ rejected this submission
                    given that the allegation of the Defendant’s lack of candour and
                    non-disclosure was vague and unsubstantiated. The position on appeal is
                    different as the fresh evidence adduced does support her assertion of the
                    Defendant’s lack of candour, at least in respect of his interest in the HK
                    Property.</p>

                        (“<em>Elements of Family Law in
                    Singapore</em>”), Professor Leong Wai Kum states the well-known
                    principle that the general duty owed by each party to make full and frank
                    disclosure of all relevant information is particularly important given the
                    court’s power and discretion to divide the parties’ matrimonial
                    assets. Professor Leong goes on to explain at p 668 of her book that the
                    position is the same in relation to the issue of maintenance. If the court is to
                    be able to achieve the purpose behind its statutory powers, it needs to have
                    “the full picture of the economic resources of the spouses and all
                    relevant facts and circumstances”. Indeed, this court is reminded of its
                    own recent admonition that “it is of importance that parties and their
                    legal representatives prepare the affidavits with as much supporting evidence so
                    as to assist the court to reach a proper determination”: see <em>Sim Kim Heng Andrew v Wee Siew Gee</em> [2013] SGHC 271
                        (“<em>Sim Kim Heng Andrew</em>”) at
                    [116]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In these circumstances, this court has to take
                    into account the fact that the Defendant has not made full and frank disclosure
                    of his assets and this effectively means that an adverse inference would be
                    drawn against him. In <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and
                        another appeal</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157, the Court of Appeal accepted
                    that there were two approaches the court could adopt upon the drawing of an
                    adverse inference. The first was to add a percentage figure <em>(eg</em>, 10%) to the spouse’s overall assets as representing
                    the spouse’s undisclosed assets. The second approach was to order a higher
                    proportion of the known assets to be given to the other spouse. There are other
                    possible methods too. In this regard, the remarks of Chao Hick Tin JA at [66]
                    bears repeating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the nature of things, whichever approach the court adopts in such a
                        situation, it is undoubtedly to a large extent speculative; whether it
                        decides to give a value to what it considers to be the undisclosed assets or
                        to give a higher percentage of the disclosed assets to the other party.
                        Either approach would translate to giving something more to the other spouse
                        by way of a specific sum. The very fact that the court is confronted with
                        the problem of undisclosed assets means that the position is unclear and far
                        from certain. In the final analysis, it is for the court to decide, in the
                        light of the fact situation of each case, which approach would in its view
                        best achieve an equitable and just result. What must be clearly recognised
                        is that when the court makes such a determination, it is not undertaking an
                        exercise based on arithmetic but a judgmental exercise based, in part at
                        least, on feel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In the present case, the fresh evidence
                    indicates that at the date of the ancillary proceedings before the learned DJ,
                    the Defendant had, at the very least, a right to receive another HK$529,000 from
                    the sale of his half-share in the HK Property to his niece and her husband.
                    Whilst the Defendant has provided some explanation of the moral pressure he was
                    under at that time, the fact remains that the information was relevant and had
                    not been disclosed in the proceedings below. Even though this court, on appeal,
                    takes note of the Defendant’s explanation for the sale of the HK Property
                    and the disposition of the sums that he has received, the inference to be drawn
                    supports the Plaintiff’s general assertion that there is a likelihood of
                    the Defendant having other undisclosed assets in Hong Kong or
                China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In the circumstances of the present case, I am
                    of the view that the most appropriate way to take account of the possibility of
                    non-disclosure is to add a percentage to the award in respect of the known
                    matrimonial assets. This is further elaborated below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision on division of the matrimonial assets and
                maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I turn now to set out this court’s
                    decision in respect of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Division of the matrimonial property </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The law pertaining to the division of
                    matrimonial assets is relatively straightforward. Section 112(1) of the WC
                    provides that the court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the
                    grant of a judgment of divorce, to order the division between the parties of any
                    matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the
                    parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the
                    court thinks <em>just and equitable</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In exercising the power to order the division
                    of matrimonial assets, s 112(2) of the WC states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">112(2). It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise
                        its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard
                        to all the circumstances of the case, including the following
                        matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party
                            in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining
                            the matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or
                            undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of
                            any child of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party
                            to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring
                            for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either
                            party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to
                            the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in
                            contemplation of divorce;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other
                            benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of
                            the other party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party
                            to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the
                            giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the
                            carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far
                            as they are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In <em>Sim Kim Heng
                        Andrew</em>, this court reviewed the basic principles pertaining to
                    the division of matrimonial assets and noted that whilst cases frequently
                    classify marital contributions as being either direct contributions or indirect
                    contributions, s 112(2) does not actually use the terms “direct”
                    and “indirect” in respect of the factors to be taken into account
                    in determining what is a <em>just and equitable</em>
                    division on the facts. Instead, a <em>non-exhaustive</em>
                    list of factors is set out in eight sub-paragraphs. Some can be directly
                    assigned a monetary value, such as monies spent on the acquisition of the
                    matrimonial asset as well as monies spent on improving or maintaining the asset.
                    Debts incurred for the benefit of the children of the marriage are also directly
                    quantifiable in monetary terms. On the other hand, many factors cannot be easily
                    assessed in monetary terms, such as the contributions made by caring for the
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In <em>Sim Kim Heng
                        Andrew</em>, it was highlighted that case law often reveals effort
                    being expended in attempting to pigeon-hole contributions into direct and
                    indirect contributions. Bearing in mind the danger of over-generalisation,
                    emphasis tends to be placed on financial contributions that are directly linked
                    to the cost of acquisition of the matrimonial property (<em>eg</em>, down payments, deposits, cash payments and mortgage
                    repayments). That said, monies spent on renovation are also important and, in
                    some cases, these may be substantial and may also add lasting value to the
                    property. In other cases, the renovation may blur into maintenance or day-to-day
                    household expenses, such as the re-painting of walls or the repair of electrical
                    wiring, <em>etc</em>. It goes without saying that other
                    financial contributions which are not attributable to the value of the
                    matrimonial asset (<em>eg</em>, a home) may include monies
                    spent on fittings such as furniture and the like. The list is endless. The point
                    made and which guides this court is that contributions to the matrimonial
                    household extend far beyond the home as a physical or economic asset. It bears
                    repeating that monies spent on the maintenance of the property are relevant to
                    the division of the matrimonial assets alongside contributions to the welfare of
                    the family. As was said by this court in <em>Sim Kim Heng
                        Andrew</em> at [83]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Classifying contributions as direct financial contributions, indirect
                        financial contributions and indirect non-financial contributions is
                        convenient and may be helpful in taking a structured approach. But, at the
                        end of the day, the classifications must not rule the decision. What rules
                        the decision is the court’s assessment of all the contributions made
                        by each spouse which are relevant so as to achieve a just and equitable
                        division. It cannot be assumed that any particular factor will always be
                        given more weight. Whether it does or does not must depend on the
                        court’s assessment of the factors as a whole. A holistic approach is
                        what the legislation requires.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Coming back to the present case, this court
                    agrees that the percentage contribution of the parties to the cost of
                    acquisition (<em>ie</em>, the initial payments and CPF
                    contributions) is in the region of 71.1% for the Defendant and 28.9% for the
                    Plaintiff. In addition, both parties claimed to have made contributions towards
                    the renovation and maintenance of the property. Whilst there is some dispute and
                    lack of certainty as to the actual amounts spent, this court has already noted
                    earlier (at [36] and [37] above) that the evidence supports the
                    Plaintiff’s claim that her financial contributions (at least S$64,645) in
                    this respect were much higher than the Defendant’s (at most
                    S$20,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Turning to the other financial contributions
                    towards the household expenses such as electricity bills and property tax, this
                    court agrees with the learned DJ that the evidence suggests that both parties
                    played their part in this respect. That said, it does not appear that due regard
                    was given to the fact that the Plaintiff was responsible for paying the rent for
                    the rental accommodation for a period of some ten years prior to the acquisition
                    of the matrimonial property. Whilst there are very few details as to the
                    payments made at that point in time, this court accepts that, as a matter of
                    principle, this is a contribution to the marital household that has to be taken
                    into account (not on a mathematical basis but by means of a broad brush
                    approach).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In the case of indirect contributions in
                    general, it will be recalled that the learned DJ at [35] of the GD found that
                    the length of the marriage was long and that both parties had played their part
                    in terms of non-financial contributions. The allegations made by each party in
                    respect of the other party’s conduct and relationship with the children
                    and family were unfortunate and have not been helpful. It has been noted that
                    the Defendant did spend long periods away from Singapore (for work-related
                    purposes) during which the Plaintiff was effectively in charge of the day-to-day
                    running of the household. During these periods, the Defendant did, however,
                    remit monies back to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The learned DJ’s decision was
                    essentially to award the Plaintiff a 50% share of the matrimonial property.
                    Taking into account the fact that the Plaintiff’s contributions towards
                    the renovations were higher than the Defendant’s, the Plaintiff’s
                    contributions towards the rent for the rental accommodation and the evidence as
                    to the non-disclosure of the HK Property (and the adverse inference that is to
                    be drawn), this court decides that the order of the learned DJ is to be varied
                    such that the Plaintiff receives a 65% share of the matrimonial
                property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Moving on, the learned DJ decided to deal with
                    the Plaintiff’s claim for maintenance as part of her overall decision on
                    the division of the matrimonial property. Aside from the Plaintiff’s age,
                    declared earnings and expenses, the learned DJ formed the view at [50] of the GD
                    that the Plaintiff “obviously had other forms of financial
                    resources”. This was especially so given the significant shortfall
                    between her declared gross monthly income and her alleged monthly expenses. The
                    point has already been discussed earlier and it has been pointed out that the
                    learned DJ used too low a figure of S$1,416.66 in calculating the
                    Plaintiff’s average monthly income (at [46] and [47] above). Nevertheless,
                    even if the Plaintiff’s figure of S$3,142 is adopted, this is still
                    considerably lower than her declared expenses of S$10,685 per month for the
                    period before the divorce. The Plaintiff’s explanation that she had been
                    relying on Mr Chay for financial support was not accepted by the learned DJ on
                    the basis that there was no concrete evidence proffered to support the
                    assertion. That said, it bears noting that even if it is accepted that Mr Chay
                    has been financially supporting the Plaintiff for many years, it is unclear
                    whether all the assistance or any part of it was by way of loans, gifts or
                    otherwise. With regard to the issue of backdated maintenance, the learned DJ
                    rejected the Plaintiff’s claim as the evidence revealed that the Defendant
                    did remit monies until he lost his job in March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In approaching the issue of maintenance, the
                    observations of MPH Rubin JC in <em>Wong Amy v Chua Seng Chuan
                        (Tow Lee Cheng Christine, co-respondent)</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 143 at
                    [39]–[40] are noteworthy. In that case, the learned judge opined that an
                    elastic approach is needed in exercising the discretion to achieve a just
                    solution driven by the court’s sense of justice. On the facts of this
                    case, whilst it is acknowledged that there has been a lack of candour on the
                    part of the Defendant, it is also clear that the learned DJ had taken the view
                    that the Plaintiff’s financial income and resources were likely to be
                    higher than that disclosed by her. This has been discussed above and this court
                    sees no reason to disagree with the learned DJ’s observations. Further,
                    given the obvious acrimony and bitterness accompanying the breakdown of the
                    marriage, as well as the state of uncertainty surrounding the Defendant’s
                    employment prospects, this court agrees that the better approach is to take into
                    account the issue of maintenance (<em>ie</em>, the
                    Plaintiff’s needs and expenses) as a factor in determining the division of
                    the matrimonial property. In coming to this decision, this court agrees with the
                    view expressed in <em>Elements of Family Law in
                        Singapore</em> at p 666 that where the just and equitable division of
                    matrimonial assets yields to the wife a fair share of the surplus wealth, the
                    order for maintenance may be nominal or even dismissed (in appropriate
                    cases).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It will be recalled that the net value of the
                    matrimonial property has been estimated to be S$1.2m. On this basis, the
                    Plaintiff will receive a sum in the region of S$780,000 if the property is sold
                    and the net sum divided in the proportion of 65:35 in favour of the Plaintiff as
                    ordered above. Bearing in mind her age, assets and needs, this figure represents
                    a fair share of the surplus wealth sufficient to account for all her maintenance
                    needs. On this basis, I am not minded to disturb the learned DJ’s decision
                    on the issue of maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The appeal is, accordingly, allowed in part.
                    The learned DJ’s orders are varied as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_a"></a>(a)     The matrimonial property at 4B
                        Marigold Drive, Singapore 576387 is to be divided in the proportion of 65:35
                        in favour of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff is given an option to buy over the
                        Defendant’s 35% share provided that she gives notice of her intention
                        to do so within 30 days from the date of this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the event that the Plaintiff opts
                        to buy over the Defendant’s 35% share, then this shall be at valuation
                        for purposes of sale in the open market less the outstanding mortgage loan.
                        The Plaintiff shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of such a
                        transfer/sale of the Defendant’s 35% share to her. The Defendant is to
                        refund his CPF account of monies utilised for the purchase, inclusive of any
                        accrued interest, from his 35% share, if so required by the CPF Board. The
                        transfer/sale of the Defendant’s 35% share to the Plaintiff shall be
                        completed within 4 months after the expiry of the 30-day option
                        period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the
                        event that the Plaintiff indicates in writing that she is not exercising the
                        option above or upon the expiry of 30 days from the date of this judgment,
                        whichever occurs first, the matrimonial property is to be sold in the open
                        market with the parties having joint conduct of the sale. Upon successful
                        sale, the proceeds are to be used to repay the outstanding mortgage loan and
                        costs and expenses of the sale. The net proceeds thereafter are to be
                        apportioned in the proportion of 65:35 in favour of the Plaintiff. The
                        parties are to refund their respective CPF accounts of monies utilised
                        therefrom for the purchase, inclusive of any accrued interest, if so
                        required by the CPF Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Plaintiff’s 65% share shall be inclusive of her
                        claims for maintenance against the Defendant. No further maintenance will be
                        ordered in favour of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    For the avoidance of doubt, Orders 6, 7 and
                    8 of the learned DJ are to remain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Given that the appeal has only succeeded in
                    part, I am not inclined to make any order as to costs. Each party shall bear
                    their own costs of this appeal. The learned DJ’s order as to costs in
                    relation to the proceedings below is to remain.</p>
