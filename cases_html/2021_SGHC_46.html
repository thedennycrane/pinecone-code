Hence, Omar is presumed to have known the nature of the drugs in the Bundles, that is, that the Bundles contained cannabis.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision on the admissibility of Omar’s Third Oral Statement and Contemporaneous Statement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Section 258(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 There are two limbs to the test of voluntariness (see <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 (“<span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53]). The first limb is an objective one and this concerns whether a threat, inducement or promise was actually made. The second limb is a subjective one and it concerns whether the threat, inducement or promise “operate[d] on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge”. I emphasise that the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily, rather than on the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the statements were not made voluntarily (see <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin </span>at [53]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohamed Ansari bin Mohamed Abdul Aziz and another </span>[2019] SGHC 268 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari</span>”) at [9]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Preliminarily, I note that Omar’s objection regarding the Third Oral Statement was that he did not actually make such a statement. As this objection did not pertain to voluntariness, the Third Oral Statement rightfully should not have been the subject of ancillary proceedings. This was conceded by Omar’s counsel. This position is explained in Illustration (<span class="font-italic">d</span>) to s 279(1) of the CPC: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">279.</span>—(1) ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Illustrations</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) The prosecution seeks to admit a statement of the accused, who denies that he made it. No ancillary hearing is necessary as this does not relate to the voluntariness of the statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Based on the evidence, I was satisfied that the Third Oral Statement had in fact been made. As I shall elaborate below, Sgt Zuhaidi’s account that Omar had given the Third Oral Statement was corroborated by SSgt Chong, Sgt Ridhuan as well as an entry in the station diary. Having concluded that the Third Oral Statement had in fact been given, I then considered the voluntariness of both the Third Oral Statement and the Contemporaneous Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I shall turn now to the facts of the present case. The crux of the dispute revolved around the objective limb of the test set out in <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin</span> – whether Sgt Zuhaidi had thrown a pen at Omar and threatened to charge Omar and Yacob with drug importation so that they would both be hanged, unless Omar cooperated and admitted to knowing about the Bundles and the drugs contained therein (“the Threat”). If the objective limb of the test is shown (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is shown that no threat, inducement or promise had actually been made), there will be no further need to consider the subjective limb of the test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Threat had not in fact been made for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The Prosecution’s witnesses and the contemporaneous evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Sgt Zuhaidi’s account of what had transpired during the recording of the Third Oral Statement and the Contemporaneous Statement was supported by two credible witnesses, as well as by the contemporaneous evidence. The Prosecution’s witnesses did not know Omar and Yacob before this case. The Car was randomly checked through a routine procedure and the Bundles were discovered by chance. There was no evidence that the officers were targeting the Car or that the officers were out to get Omar or Yacob. Thus, there was no evidence to suggest that the officers who dealt with Omar and Yacob wanted to do any harm to them. These officers were just doing their job. I shall now consider the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I turn first to the evidence of Sgt Ridhuan, who confirmed that the Third Oral Statement had taken place, and that no threat, inducement or promise had been made during the recording of the Contemporaneous Statement. It was not disputed that Sgt Ridhuan was very near to both Sgt Zuhaidi and Omar at the relevant times.

</div> these did not compromise the reliability or veracity of his evidence. According to Omar, Sgt Zuhaidi had used clear words to threaten him and had even thrown a pen at him. These would have been noticed by Sgt Ridhuan even if he was not paying full attention or could only see Omar’s side view. Rather than diminishing the weight to be given to his evidence, I found that Sgt Ridhuan was candid on this point and this bolstered his credibility as an honest and forthcoming witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I turn next to the evidence of SSgt Chong, who also confirmed that the Third Oral Statement was given, and that Omar had admitted that the Bundles were marijuana and they belonged to him.

In contrast, the police report was made later at around 5am, by which time SSgt Chong was able to consolidate the facts from Sgt Zuhaidi and list them down in the police report.

First, it was unlikely that the station diary would have referred to the Bundles being “cannabis” and “marijuana” unless Omar had told the CNB officers so. In addition to the entry in the station diary at 12.36am which referred to Omar admitting that the Bundles were “marijuana”, another entry in the station diary at “0040” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 12.40am) reads, “Eden [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SSgt Chong] put the 3 bundles of cannabis into the large tamper proof bag”.

</div> Thus, Sgt Zuhaidi and SSgt Chong could not have known for sure that the Bundles were cannabis, unless Omar had told them so.

By the time Omar’s long statements were recorded, he had taken a diametrically different position from that set out in his prior statements, including the Contemporaneous Statement and the Cautioned Statement. Specifically, he denied that he knew that the Bundles contained cannabis, and he further denied that he had agreed to bring the Bundles into Singapore. Instead, he suggested that Din might have put the Bundles in the Car while he was in the toilet.

</div> In these circumstances, there was no reason to withhold the additional explanation that he had been earlier coerced into giving the Contemporaneous Statement, or that the Third Oral Statement had not taken place. This is especially given that he was specifically asked for an explanation in that regard. He did not have to trust IO Shamaani in order to provide that explanation. Indeed, despite his alleged mistrust of IO Shamaani, he was nevertheless willing to tell IO Shamaani his defence in respect of the charge. Therefore, Omar’s failure to mention the Threat until the CFD was filed suggested that it was merely an afterthought created by him to counter the incriminating effect of the Third Oral Statement and the Contemporaneous Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For completeness, I should mention that although the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded in English, Omar is conversant in English and he understands the English language.

However, I had already found in the first ancillary hearing that no Threat had been made by Sgt Zuhaidi to Omar at any point in time (see [53] above).

</div> All of this suggested that the link he made between the Threat and the Cautioned Statement was, as with the Threat itself, a mere afterthought and fabricated by him as he was not able to explain the incriminating statement he gave in the Cautioned Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Finally, I shall address Omar’s counsel’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari </span>to support Omar’s case. In <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari</span>, Chan Seng Onn J found that the Prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that four statements given by the accused had been made voluntarily. Chan J found that the accused managed to raise a reasonable doubt that those statements had been given in order to protect his girlfriend, pursuant to several inducements from the CNB officers. Omar’s counsel submitted that the facts in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari </span>were similar to the facts in the present case and that the inducement was even stronger in this case given that the relationship between Omar and Yacob was that of a father and son.

</div>
</div> However, the inquiry of voluntariness is highly fact-specific. The critical difference between <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari </span>and the present case is that in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari</span>, Chan J had found that the accused had raised a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case that the inducements had not been made (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari </span>at [37] and [50]). This was based, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>on an assessment that the accused’s evidence was more credible and that the recording officers’ accounts were “hard to believe” (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari </span>at [38]) and “oscillating” and “not credible” (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari </span>at [52]). This was not the case here. No reasonable doubt was raised by Omar in the Prosecution’s case that the Threat had not been made. The evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses was credible and consistent. It was Omar’s evidence which I found to be lacking credibility and unbelievable. Hence, <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Ansari </span>was of little assistance to Omar in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Therefore, I rejected Omar’s testimony that the Threat had been made and that he had been influenced by the Threat in giving his Cautioned Statement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Omar’s allegation that he was tired</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I turn now to Omar’s claim that he gave his Cautioned Statement because he was tired and had not gotten sufficient rest. He did not mention this in his examination-in-chief during the second ancillary hearing, but he had raised it previously in the main trial when he was cross-examined on it by the Prosecution in the second ancillary hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Omar’s claim regarding being tired was essentially a claim of oppression. In this regard, Explanation 1 to s 258 of the CPC states that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that <span class="font-italic">his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement</span>, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise, as the case may be, which will render the statement inadmissible. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Court of Appeal explained the test for oppression in <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin </span>at [56] and [57] as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 Oppression is a circumstance which may render a confession involuntary and thus inadmissible, and whether the accused has been subjected to oppression is a question of fact: <span class="font-italic">Seow Choon Meng v PP </span>([53]) <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). In <span class="font-italic">R v Priestly </span>(1967) 51 Cr App R 1, Sachs LJ, as he then was, said: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]his word [oppression] … imports something which tends to sap, and has sapped, that free will which must exist before a confession is voluntary. … Whether or not there is oppression in an individual case depends upon many elements. … They include such things as the length of time of any individual period of questioning, the length of time intervening between periods of questioning, whether the accused person has been given proper refreshment or not, and the characteristics of the person who makes the statement. What may be oppressive as regards a child, an invalid or an old man or somebody inexperienced in the ways of this world may turn out not to be oppressive when one finds that the accused person is of a tough character and an experienced man of the world. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57 In other words, a statement would not be extracted by oppression unless the accused was in such a state that his will was ‘sapped’ and he could not resist making a statement which he would otherwise not have made: <span class="font-italic">PP v Tan Boon Tat </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 287. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 At the end of the second ancillary hearing, I was not convinced by Omar’s claim that his tiredness was to such an extent that his giving of the Cautioned Statement was involuntary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Omar’s claim was not borne out on the evidence. Based on the passage from <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin </span>at [57] cited above, the threshold for a finding of oppression is a relatively high one. However, this does not shift the burden of proof which is always on the Prosecution to satisfy the court beyond a reasonable doubt that Omar gave his Cautioned Statement voluntarily without inducement, threat or promise. For oppression to be shown, it requires that the accused “was in such a state that his will was ‘sapped’”. This was by no means the case here. Omar himself admitted that he was not involved in any investigation-related activities between 2.32am and 4.25am, as well as between 5am and 7.30am. During these times, he had been sitting down on a chair in the CNB office, waiting for the investigation to proceed.

In relation to Dr Varma and IO Shamaani in particular, both of them agreed that Omar was responsive, cognisant of his surroundings and fit to give a statement. In this regard, I did not place significant weight on the fact that Dr Varma’s medical examination was primarily a physical examination and did not pertain specifically to Omar’s mental state. As Dr Varma explained, he assessed Omar’s mental state using “surrogates for examining the mental capacity as well as the mental state of the patient”, specifically, Omar’s alertness, cooperation, whether Omar was agitated or resisted physical examination, and whether Omar was verbally aggressive towards the doctor or the police officers.

Furthermore, as shall be explained at [121] below, it is clear from Omar’s First Oral Statement to Cpl Loo that he knew of the presence of the three Bundles in the Bag. Therefore, the Bundles were in his possession or custody or under his control within the meaning of s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Since Omar is presumed under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to have been in possession of the Bundles, the presumption under s 18(2) also applies.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Hence, the presumptions in both ss 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 18(2) of the MDA apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It should be noted that the Prosecution is not contending that Omar was <span class="font-italic">wilfully blind </span>to the presence of the Bundles.

The events surrounding their arrest should have been fresh in Yacob’s mind at the time. It also bears emphasis that Yacob is Omar’s father – if he had seen Sgt Faliq threaten to slap Omar, there would have been no reason at all for him to conceal this. Therefore, the fact that Yacob did not mention Sgt Faliq raising his hand against Omar or otherwise threatening to slap Omar suggests that such a threat did not take place.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Secondly, Sgt Faliq’s account of the relevant events is also supported by IO Shamaani’s testimony. As I explained at [45] above, IO Shamaani had viewed the CCTV footage of the events that occurred from the time of Omar’s arrest. She did not see anything remarkable, nor did Omar make any allegation regarding Sgt Faliq or the Second Oral Statement. Therefore, she did not retrieve the CCTV footage at the relevant time. IO Shamaani’s testimony clearly refutes Omar’s testimony in court that Sgt Faliq’s threat to slap him would have been captured on the CCTV footage.

</div> As with Sgt Zuhaidi and SSgt Chong, while Sgt Faliq might have guessed that the Bundles were cannabis and fabricated the Second Oral Statement, as alleged by Omar, this was highly unlikely. Sgt Faliq was an ICA officer and he handed over the matter to the CNB after Sgt Zuhaidi and SSgt Chong arrived at the scene.

</div> There was no reason why he would fabricate his evidence regarding the Second Oral Statement. Therefore, the only plausible explanation for Sgt Faliq knowing that the Bundles were cannabis was that Omar had told him so, as per the Second Oral Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In contrast, Omar’s case relied solely on his own testimony. He did not adduce any other evidence to support his contention that Sgt Faliq had threatened to slap him, and that he had not made the Second Oral Statement. However, I did not find Omar a particularly credible witness. This was especially given my rejection of Omar’s allegations that Sgt Zuhaidi threw a pen at him and issued the Threat to him (see [53] above). Here, he was making a similar allegation that Sgt Faliq had threatened to slap him if he did not admit that the Bundles belonged to him. Given his willingness to lie freely in court regarding the events surrounding the Third Oral Statement, the Contemporaneous Statement and the Cautioned Statement, it was evident that he had similarly lied when it came to the Second Oral Statement to avoid its incriminating effect. Furthermore, this allegation regarding Sgt Faliq surfaced only in Omar’s testimony in court.

</div> As with the Third Oral Statement, the Contemporaneous Statement and the Cautioned Statement, Omar had multiple opportunities to raise the alleged threat made by Sgt Faliq. However, he did not do so. This suggests that such an allegation was fabricated and merely an afterthought. Hence, his testimony has to be treated with extreme caution. Given that he could not produce any other evidence supporting his case, I am not inclined to accept his testimony at face value, especially when weighed against the other evidence adduced by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Therefore, I find that Omar had made the Second Oral Statement to Sgt Faliq, and that Sgt Faliq did not at any point in time threaten to slap Omar if he did not admit that the Bundles belonged to him.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The messages on the Phones</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I shall turn now to the other evidence before the court.

</div> Mr Faiz explained that the translations of the messages referring to “thing” were derived from the Malay word “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>”. Although the literal meaning of “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>is “thing”, it is often used by those involved in illegal drug activities as a slang to refer to “drugs”. This generic term is often used in order to conceal the true nature of the transaction.

These suggest that Omar knew the nature of the Bundles and intentionally brought them into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 This deeply incriminating evidence is denied by Omar. The existence of these phone messages cannot be disputed. Read in their totality, they destroy Omar’s entire defence to smithereens, specifically, Omar’s claims regarding Din and Latif whom he alleged had placed the Bundles in his Bag despite his refusal to bring them into Singapore. Thus, Omar had to convincingly explain the phone messages. He said that Jay was his Malaysian supplier for textiles and cloths. Jay was also his distant relative, whom he had been introduced to by his cousin, Isa bin Paiman (“Isa”).

</div> In his Fifth Long Statement, when IO Shamaani confronted Omar with the phone messages, he explained that he had arranged to meet Jay outside the Mosque to look at <span class="font-italic">sarong</span> designs. In this context, the message “Want to order 3” referred to Omar wanting to order three <span class="font-italic">sarong</span> designs. When Omar and Jay met on 11 July 2018, Omar did not buy anything as he did not like any of the designs.

</div> In his testimony in court, Omar had another explanation regarding these phone messages. He claimed that “3” referred to three <span class="font-italic">k</span><span class="font-italic">odi</span>, a unit of measurement for cloth – one <span class="font-italic">kodi </span>refers to 20 pieces of cloth. I shall deal with these critical discrepancies in his explanation below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Having considered the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I find that the messages exchanged between Omar and Jay pertained to the order and collection of drugs by Omar from Jay, specifically, the three Bundles. Two aspects of the messages are particularly revealing. First, Omar sent Jay a message that he “[w]ant[ed] to order 3” and Jay replied that “the thing is available”. It is clear from these messages that Omar had ordered three Bundles from Jay, and that they had arranged to meet in person for Omar to collect the said Bundles from Jay. Secondly, the use of the word “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” – a commonly-used slang to refer to drugs – suggests that the conversation was one pertaining to drugs, which Jay and Omar wished to conceal by the use of the word “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>”.

</div> Taken together, therefore, the messages show that Omar had pre-ordered the Bundles from Jay on 10 July 2018 for collection on 11 July 2018.

</div> His explanation for this was that he wanted to avoid paying tax – if he had receipts of his purchases of textiles from Jay, and such receipts were discovered by the authorities, he would have to pay tax.

</div>
</div> This explanation is highly unsatisfactory. Receipts are not the only documentary evidence available to show that Omar had past transactions with Jay. If there were prior textile-related transactions between Omar and Jay, why did the phone messages not have a single iota of evidence to suggest this? Instead the phone messages contained only messages ostensibly relating to illegal drug transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 If the story about Jay’s phone messages and his textile business with Omar was indeed true, this would have been crucial to Omar’s innocence. Why then did Omar not call Jay to the stand to testify in support of his case? At the time of the investigations, Omar also failed to provide any information to the CNB to assist them in finding Jay.

</div> If that was truly the case, one would expect Omar to have been much more forthcoming with this information, as it could potentially exonerate him. However, Omar claimed that since he was in remand, he was unable to secure Jay as his witness. But he could have sought Yacob’s assistance or provided information to the CNB to enable them to locate Jay. However, this was not the case here. Yacob did not even know Jay, a purported distant relative. Therefore, Omar’s story about Jay and the textile business on 11 July 2018 seriously lacks credibility.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In this regard, Omar’s counsel submitted that the Prosecution’s interpretation of the messages (see [92] above) should not be adopted as the <span class="font-italic">Prosecution</span> did not call Jay to testify and confirm the said interpretation.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-076b1b1c-d762-446a-b1ba-d9bcc964dce7" data-toggle="modal" type="button">194</button></sup>

</div> However, I do not find that this is fatal to the Prosecution’s case. The interpretation contended by the Prosecution is supported by the contents of the messages themselves, as well as the fact that Omar knew the nature of the Bundles before they were opened (as I shall elaborate below). Furthermore, I observe that although the Prosecution did not call Jay to testify as a witness at the trial, it was not for lack of trying. As I shall elaborate at [108] below, the Prosecution attempted several times to locate Jay, but to no avail. In this regard, the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Beh Chew Boo </span>at [72] are apposite – the Prosecution does not have a “duty to locate and to call witnesses to rebut wild or unsubstantiated allegations”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Omar’s explanation regarding Jay was not borne out by the evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Secondly, Omar’s explanation regarding Jay and the messages is not borne out by the messages themselves.

As such, Jay would “know [his] usual order” and “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” was simply “a general word referring to the cloth or textile that [Jay was] selling”.

Because the IO wanted to know about the drugs rather than my own business, so what does my business got to do with the drugs? So I do not have to elaborate on what is this ‘3’ about, Sir. And the IO didn’t ask me this question in details, Your Honour. As such, I answered it in such a manner, Sir. Brief answer, Sir. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In my view, this explanation is not at all credible. At the time, Omar would have known that he was facing a capital charge for importation of cannabis into Singapore. This was an extremely serious charge with grave consequences upon conviction. He must have known that the questions posed to him by IO Shamaani were part of investigations pertaining to his charge. In such circumstances, it is hard to believe that Omar would treat IO Shamaani’s questions so lightly. Furthermore, Omar’s explanation that he was being brief is in itself illogical. The inconsistency between Omar’s Fifth Long Statement and his testimony in court is not simply that the Fifth Long Statement was a brief version of his testimony in court. To the contrary, they are two completely distinct accounts of what the number “3” referred to. On one hand, Omar’s Fifth Long Statement states that “3” referred to three <span class="font-italic">sarong </span>designs. On the other hand, Omar’s testimony in court was that “3” referred to three <span class="font-italic">kodi</span>, or 60 pieces of cloth. These two accounts are factually inconsistent and are not reconcilable on the basis that the former is a brief version of the latter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Additionally, I find it significant that Omar’s explanation regarding Jay was not brought up until the messages from his Phones were shown to him by IO Shamaani during the recording of the Fifth Long Statement on 3 May 2019, approximately ten months after his arrest.

IO Zhong explained that he had retrieved a phone number connected to Isa from Yacob’s phone contact records. Based on a subscriber screening of that phone number, it transpired that the phone number belonged to one Sheikh Abdul Rahman (“Mr Sheikh”), Omar’s cousin. Mr Sheikh denied being Isa, and informed IO Zhong that Isa was a distant cousin whom he had not contacted for many years. Both Mr Sheikh’s father and uncle also stated that they had not contacted Isa for many years.

After having fully considered the evidence presented at the two ancillary hearings, I had already rejected Omar’s allegations regarding the Threat and him being too tired to give his Cautioned Statement.

</div> Therefore, there is no reason to give less weight to these statements. In relation to the Contemporaneous Statement in particular, I also reject Omar’s counsel’s submission that Sgt Zuhaidi’s “primary objective” in recording the Contemporaneous Statement was “solely to ensure [Omar] admitted to the knowledge of the [B]undles”.

</div> This is not at all apparent from the questions posed by Sgt Zuhaidi to Omar. The questions posed were generally open-ended questions. Although the questioning was brief, it is important to bear in mind that the Contemporaneous Statement was recorded at a very early stage of the investigations and Sgt Zuhaidi was not the investigating officer for the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Furthermore, although Omar claims that he referred to cannabis only as “<span class="font-italic">ganja</span>” and did not know the term “marijuana” (used in the Contemporaneous Statement),

</div> Hence, there is no plausible explanation for why Omar kept on changing his position as regards the relevant events of 11 July 2018. Instead, Omar’s numerous and shifting explanations highlighted that he was willing to fabricate evidence to claim his innocence. This further undermines his credibility and the veracity of his testimony in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The logical conclusion, therefore, is that Omar was not telling the truth in his Long Statements. The First Long Statement was recorded on 17 July 2018, five days after Omar’s arrest. It appears to me that by then, Omar likely realised the inculpatory nature of his Non-Long Statements and sought to exonerate himself, in an attempt to bolster his defence that he did not know the nature of the Bundles and did not intentionally bring them into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Lack of explanation for how he could have known the information given in the Non-Long Statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Furthermore, there was no explanation for how Omar could have given the information that he did in the Non-Long Statements, unless he knew that the Bundles were cannabis and had agreed to bring them into Singapore.

</div> In these circumstances, if Omar had truly been unaware of the presence of the Bundles in the Bag, he could not have known that the Bag contained two other Bundles.

This was different from his previous explanation that he had been influenced by the packaging of the Bundles. This vacillation suggests that these explanations are not true. Rather, Omar was fabricating them as and when it suited him. In any case, I am also not convinced by this subsequent explanation. It is clear that the contents of the Bundles are brown, not green. It is inexplicable that Omar could have looked at the brown contents of the Bundles and thought to describe them as “green”, which is coincidentally also the slang in drug circles used to describe cannabis. In my view, Omar’s vacillating and confusing explanations were simply futile attempts to distance himself from the conclusion that he was familiar with drug terms such as “green”.

</div> This significantly diminishes the credibility of his defence as set out in his Third Long Statement and suggests that it was an afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133  Furthermore, the Cautioned Statement was recorded on 12 July 2018, whereas the Third Long Statement was recorded on 18 July 2018. In between the recording of the Cautioned Statement and the Third Long Statement, Omar’s First Long Statement and Second Long Statement were recorded from him on 17 July 2018. Despite having these opportunities to correct a critical fact he previously admitted to, Omar only raised his defence in his Third Long Statement, when asked about the discrepancies between his Long Statements and his Contemporaneous Statement. In light of all these circumstances, I am not inclined to believe his defence as set out in his Long Statements, CFD and testimony in court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on Omar’s statements, CFD and testimony in court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 For the above reasons, I place little weight on Omar’s Long Statements, CFD and testimony in court. In my view, his accounts as set out in his Long Statements, CFD and testimony in court should not be believed. Not only was Omar unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for his sudden about-turn as to the facts, the information provided by him in his Non-Long Statements suggests that he in fact knew the nature of the Bundles and had agreed to bring them into Singapore. Furthermore, he vacillated in his Long Statements, CFD and testimony in court, which suggests that he was not telling the truth. This is reinforced by the fact that he only mentioned his defence in his Third Long Statement, which was in direct contradiction to his admission in his Cautioned Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 According to Omar’s Non-Long Statements, he ran into Din and Latif at the Restaurant. Din and Latif then asked him to bring the Bundles into Singapore. He agreed to do so, knowing that the Bundles were cannabis. This account of how Omar came to be in possession of the Bundles appears to be at odds with the messages from the Phones, which suggest that Omar had obtained the Bundles from Jay in the vicinity of the Mosque. The phone messages are objective, independent and contemporaneous evidence that do not lie. Omar’s attempt to explain away the phone messages by suggesting that they were about textile transactions is most unconvincing. The phone messages suggest that Omar had pre-ordered the Bundles from Jay on 10 July 2018, which he then collected from Jay on 11 July 2018 and brought into Singapore on 12 July 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136  Therefore, I find that Omar knew the nature of the Bundles and he intentionally brought the Bundles into Singapore. These facts are supported by the messages recovered from Omar’s Phones. Omar’s knowledge that the Bundles were cannabis is also supported by the Non-Long Statements, even if I disbelieve Omar’s account regarding Din and Latif therein. Specifically, it is clear from the First Oral Statement that Omar knew that there were three Bundles in the Bag, even before the other two Bundles had been taken out. Furthermore, based on Omar’s admissions to Sgt Faliq and Sgt Zuhaidi in the Second Oral Statement, the Third Oral Statement and the Contemporaneous Statement, he knew that the Bundles were cannabis. This was at the time when the Bundles had not yet been opened. Therefore, the Non-Long Statements support the finding that Omar knew the nature of the Bundles and had intentionally brought them into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The DNA evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I turn now to the DNA evidence. Exhibits taken from the Bundles and their packaging were swabbed and sent for analysis by the HSA. No interpretable DNA profile was obtained from all of the exhibits, except for two DNA profiles were obtained from the cling film and the plastic of one of the Bundles (see [6] above). However, neither of these two DNA profiles matched Omar’s DNA profile.

The Prosecution’s witness, Ms Wong Hang Yee, who prepared the relevant HSA report, explained that although no interpretable DNA profile was obtained from the exhibits, it was still possible that Omar had handled the exhibits. This was because the absence of interpretable DNA profile could have been due to several reasons, such as Omar wearing protective gear, the amount of DNA left on the exhibits being insufficient or the DNA left on the exhibits having degraded.

</div> Even if Omar did not come into contact with the Bundles himself, he could have told Jay to put the Bundles into his Bag, with full knowledge of the nature of the Bundles. In other words, the absence of his DNA on the relevant exhibits does not exonerate him from the charge as he knew and admitted to the Bundles being cannabis when he imported them into Singapore through Woodlands Checkpoint.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the importation charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In conclusion, I find that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the importation charge against Omar. First, it is undisputed that Omar was in possession of the Bundles found in the Bag. In any case, the presumption of possession pursuant to s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA applies and Omar has not successfully rebutted the presumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Secondly, I find that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Omar had knowledge of the nature of the Bundles. He knew that the Bundles were cannabis. This is evident from the fact that he was able to identify in his Second Oral Statement, Third Oral Statement and Contemporaneous Statement that the Bundles were cannabis, even before the Bundles were opened and processed by the CNB. This is also supported by my finding, based on the messages recovered from Omar’s Phones, that Omar had pre-ordered the Bundles from Jay on 10 July 2018. Given that he ordered the Bundles, he should have known what the Bundles contained. In this case, the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA applies. Based on the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that Omar has successfully rebutted this presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Thirdly, I find that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Bundles were intentionally brought into Singapore by Omar without prior authorisation. This is evident from the fact that Omar could identify the number of Bundles in the Bag even though, at the time, two out of the three Bundles had not yet been taken out of the Bag. If he knew about the presence of the Bundles in this Bag, this shows that he intended to bring them into Singapore. This is also supported by my finding that Omar had pre-ordered the Bundles. Given that he had pre-ordered the Bundles, he must also have intended to bring them back into Singapore.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In this regard, I reject Omar’s defence that the Bundles were planted in his Bag by Din and Latif without his knowledge. This defence is not supported by any contemporaneous or objective evidence. Instead, Omar’s defence relies largely on his own testimony and his Long Statements. However, there were numerous material inconsistences and vacillations in his defence.

</div> In addition, I did not find him to be a credible witness. Hence, he has not been able to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 For these reasons, I find that the Prosecution has proven the charge against Omar for importation of cannabis beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I convict him on the charge under s 7 of the MDA.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Pursuant to s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, the prescribed punishment for unauthorised importation of more than 500g of cannabis is death. Section 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA permits an alternative sentence of mandatory life imprisonment and not less than 15 strokes of the cane if the two conditions in s 33B(2) are met. Section 33B(2) reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The requirements referred to in subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the person convicted proves, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in the offence under section 5(1) or 7 was restricted –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) to transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) to offering to transport, send or deliver a controlled drug; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) to doing or offering to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of his transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) to any combination of activities in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii); and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the Public Prosecutor certifies to any court that, in his determination, the person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In this case, the Prosecution did not contest that Omar’s involvement in the offence fell within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. The Prosecution referred to the decision in <span class="font-italic">Zamri bin Mohd Tahir v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 1 SLR 724, where the Court of Appeal observed at [15]–[17] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 … The focus of the inquiry required by s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA is on <span class="font-italic">the accused’s </span>acts in relation to the particular consignment of drugs which form the subject matter of the charge against him. … [T]he appellant’s intentions at the relevant time were inchoate in the sense that they depended entirely on what someone else might decide or do at a point in time when no such decision or action had been made or taken. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 In the present case, on the evidence before the court, it was, in truth, unknown and unknowable what the accused would have done after he had taken delivery of the drugs. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 We accept that in many instances where the accused is arrested before he has been able to deal with the drugs, the court may nevertheless infer that his role was to do more such that he should not be found to be a courier. This would be the case, for instance, where the accused has already been instructed or engaged, or is otherwise already committed and resolved to do other things such as to divide and pack the drugs. But this will only be so where the evidence allows the court to find that he would have gone on to do such acts but for his arrest. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Applying the principles set out above, the Prosecution conceded, and rightly so, that there is insufficient evidence to indicate what Omar intended to do with the Bundles after he had taken delivery of them and returned to Singapore. The evidence before the court only indicates that Omar had pre-ordered the Bundles, collected them in Johor Bahru, and then transported them from Johor Bahru into Singapore. Thus, I find that Omar was a courier whose involvement in the offence fell within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 However, the Prosecution also informed the court that Omar did not receive a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor. Thus, the requirement under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA is not satisfied, and the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA is not available to Omar. Therefore, I sentence Omar to the mandatory sentence of death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 For the above reasons, I find that the charge against Omar has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and convict him accordingly. I impose on Omar the mandatory sentence of death.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Senthilkumaran s/o Sabapathy and Gabriel Lim Cher Wei (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kishan Pratap (Kishan Law Chambers LLC) and Ho Thiam Huat (T H Ho Law Chambers) for the accused.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
