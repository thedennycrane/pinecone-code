If IO Xu had wanted to incriminate D for the offences which V alleged, it was unlikely that he would have recorded denials, allowed D to qualify his previous statement (P28) or recorded equivocal answers. For instance, D claimed that Supt Burhan and IO Xu told him to admit to putting his finger in V’s vagina, yet D denied this in P29 and further qualified P28.

V’s 1st Statement contained other acts not mentioned in P28, and if IO Xu had wanted to implicate D by fabricating P28, he would not have merely mentioned cursorily that D had molested V, put his finger inside her vagina and rubbed his penis on her vagina and backside without mentioning the other acts in V’s 1st Statement. Mr Shafiq’s attempt to show that IO Xu was not a credible witness, as he had failed to mention in his conditioned statement that he had recorded a statement from V, is not borne out by the evidence.

</div> Unlike D’s own inconsistent testimony as to how the Statements came to be (see [32]–[33] above), I found IO Xu to be a credible witness who was generally consistent in his testimony. I accepted that IO Xu had no motive to set D up, and if he wanted to frame D in the Statements he would not have included denials and qualifiers in P29 or P30 or omitted other allegations which V had made (see [43] and [45] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I turn to another aspect of D’s testimony to show that his claim that he had signed the Statements based on an inducement or a promise could not be believed. D claimed that Supt Burhan, IO Xu and ASP Razak promised him “station bail”. Hence, D informed Mdm An in two separate phone calls that he would be able to go home soon as he would be given bail, and again informed her during the Site Visit that he would be given station bail.

He could have told Mdm An on his own volition to assuage her as he claimed to have been very concerned about her. As Mdm An attested, D had informed her even at the time of his arrest (and before the Statements were recorded) that “It’s okay, Mum. Later [D] will come out.”

D was not Mdm An’s main caregiver and he knew this. For 16 years (until 2016 before D’s father passed away), Mdm An was living with D’s brother (“SM”). Thereafter, she stayed with D as she pitied D who was then without a wife and to care for his children. After D’s arrest, Mdm An went to live with SM again, and D was informed by her of this when he called her on 23 November 2017 and hence he felt relieved.

D then touched her breasts, removed her clothes, inserted his finger into her vagina and she complied with his instructions to fellate him. D placed V in a “doggy” position (with her knees on the bed) before inserting his penis into her anus. D inserted his penis in and out of V’s anus until he ejaculated on her back. V recalled this incident clearly as it was the first time D had penetrated her anus and it was the “most painful experience”. When D was doing this, V told him to stop as it was painful, but D told her to bear with it. V also told D subsequently that she had difficulty defecating but D told her that it would be all right after a few days and that she would get used to it.

The sexual acts continued and although V at times tried to resist by moving away from D, he would pull her closer to him. Eventually she gave up resisting as it was futile to do so and she was not strong enough to overpower him.

At the Woodlands Flat, V slept on the bed with D (when B and V slept in his room). Although he had hugged V whilst they were sleeping, this was accidental as he was unaware of what he was doing when he was asleep. He only discovered this incident after N had reported it to the police in September 2012. I will return to this incident later (see [110] below). After that incident, D continued to share the bed with V and he only “bumped” into her accidentally when they were sleeping but he did not hug her.  At the Yishun Flat 2nd Occasion, D claimed that V would sometimes choose to sleep on the lower deck of the bunk bed. He would try to wake her and get her to sleep on the upper deck but to no avail. Hence, he just slept on the lower deck with her. Whilst they slept together, he would have hugged her, but he did not consider it to be inappropriate.

A witness’s testimony may be found to be unusually convincing by weighing the witness’s demeanour alongside the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’s testimony (<span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [115]). Where the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story. As to whether evidence can amount to corroboration, the court looks at “the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate” (<span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [173]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">General observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I found V’s testimony to be unusually convincing. She was coherent and consistent in the material aspects of her testimony. Despite the passage of time with the offences taking place some six to 10 years prior to her testimony in court, V was able to recall in some detail the incidents and maintained a consistent account during trial and in cross-examination. This is in contrast to D who often contradicted himself on the stand and changed his position. Further, V’s account that D had on multiple occasions sexually abused her was supported by D’s own admissions to various persons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 At this stage, I make some general observations. First, I reiterate that D can understand and speak English. Apart from my findings at [27] to [28] above, I observed at the trial that D could understand the questions put to him, he would often answer them even before they were interpreted to him, and he would frequently answer questions partly in English. When shown in court a report by a Dr Sarkar who had conducted a psychiatric assessment of D in 2017 (“Dr Sarkar’s Report”), D could read it to himself without the aid of translation.

In P28, he stated that he had done “sexual things” to V and had molested her since she was 10 years old. In P29, D stated that he first started doing sexual things to V when she was 10 years old at the Yishun Flat, that it started one night when he was sleeping on the same mattress as her, and he started to touch her all over including her breast and rubbing her vagina. D also stated that at first V did not know about sex as she was very young and did not know it was wrong and hence she allowed him to do the sexual acts – this cohered with V’s testimony.

When first asked about the Yishun Flat 1st Occasion, D claimed that he never slept with any of his children on the same mattress. However, his evidence morphed along the way. Initially in EIC, D confirmed that sometimes he would sleep on the mattress together with his children. He subsequently changed his account by stating that he had never slept with any of his children, and that the mattresses would be placed quite a distance apart from each other. Then he stated that V slept with him on the same mattress although there was no physical contact.

As noted in Dr Sarkar’s Report, the first instance of abuse occurred when he found himself next to V whilst sleeping on a mattress on the floor.

When cross-examined on K and F’s habit of having conversations with D in his bedroom whilst the family was sleeping and the lights were off, which would seem rather unusual, D then said that K only came into the room to look for him if there was an “emergency” or “urgency”. He then claimed that this occurred about once a week, which I did not believe. D then attempted to explain that K would “talk about personal things”, and sometimes needed D to drive him to the hospital because of gastric pain. When pressed, D then claimed that K only needed to go to the hospital on less than five occasions in total throughout D’s stay at the Yishun Flat 1st and 2nd Occasions.

I accepted V’s testimony that when S went to sleep in the master bedroom and on the bed (with V and D), V would sleep in between S and D.  I rejected D’s version that S would sleep in between D and V, in a bid to show that he could not have committed any sexual acts with V whilst S was sleeping on the bed.

In September 2012, N lodged a police report against D after having witnessed D hugging V from her back and around her chest whilst sleeping on the bed. N felt that D was holding V inappropriately and hence made the police report to protect V. When the police came to investigate, D told them that he was not aware of what he had done whilst asleep. However, D stated that after this incident he became aware that he had hugged and touched V inappropriately.

</div> D also knew all along that it would be wrong to touch V’s breasts or private part. He also knew by the 2012 Incident that touching V inappropriately could amount to molest, and he should try to ensure that it would not recur. Indeed D admitted that after the 2012 Incident, would accidentally “bump” into V whilst sleeping with her. Yet, and despite all these, he made no effort to sleep apart from V such as on a mattress on the floor when he could have. He knew he had to be careful, yet he continued to allow V to sleep on his bed and even slept with her.

</div> I accepted that V returned to stay with D because he promised to turn over a new leaf and he told her he needed to apply for a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat with B and V forming a family unit. She thought that D was genuinely remorseful as he had cried to her, and she gave him another chance. V’s conduct was not implausible nor unusual, as she still shared a close relationship with D.

</div> It was inconceivable that V would, even when living with N and Z, cease contact with D completely merely because he had previously made her do household chores and had not provided her financial support. After all, D claimed that V was still close to him.

</div> D’s claim, that V minimised contact with him because he had scolded her about some messages she exchanged with her boyfriend, was an afterthought. It was never put to V and he admitted that it was his speculation. Hence, I found that the main reason V had run away and ceased contact with D was because of the sexual abuse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I further rejected D’s assertion that V had fabricated the sexual allegations as she was afraid that N would send her back to live with D after the SAFRA and Marsiling Meetings. Whilst V believed that N wanted to send her back to live with D when N packed her clothes for the SAFRA Meeting, N did not pack her clothes for the Marsiling Meeting nor inform V that she wanted V to stay with D on that occasion. D agreed that the sole purpose of the Marsiling Meeting was for him to speak to V regarding her conduct. Further, after the SAFRA and Marsiling Meetings, V returned to live with N and Z and it was not disputed that V and D led their separate lives.

</div> There was thus no reason why V would thereafter fabricate such serious allegations against D.

V’s conduct had been consistent throughout. She did not complain initially because she did not realise that the acts were wrong, until she attended a sex education class. She then tried to resist but could not overpower her father. She was then not close to her mother, much less her stepfather, as to confide in them. She was further concerned about the consequences on the family relationships (including the relationship between B and D, which was also what she had informed Dr Pathy in March 2018) if she revealed the sexual abuse.

</div> Thus, it was not impossible nor improbable that the sleeping occupants in the room would not have stirred and even if there was some noise that they would not have suspected anything was amiss. B and S were then young and would not have reason to suspect that their father was abusing their sister. Pertinently, B recalled that one night at the Woodlands Flat he was awoken by the rustling of the bed and the sound of the bed frame hitting the wall, and he heard V say “Stop. It’s painful.”

</div> This supported V’s account that B would sometimes stir in his sleep whilst the sexual activities were going on. D himself suggested that at the Yishun Flat 1st Occasion, there was quite a distance between him and someone else whenever he slept on the mattress. Hence it was possible that any movement during the sexual activities would not have alerted the sleeping occupants. As for V not crying out when D inserted his finger into her vagina, I accepted that V was then in shock.

In contrast, I found D to be an untruthful witness who contradicted himself on material aspects, and there were internal and external inconsistencies in his testimony.

It submitted that the key sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution should apply. V was a minor and a vulnerable victim when the offences occurred. There was an abuse of trust in a familial context, with such offences being hard to detect as victims of intra-familial sexual abuse may be unwilling or hesitant to report the matter to the authorities. Crucially, the incidents only came to light because Z had initiated a conversation with V about her relationship with D. The sexual abuse also persisted for nearly five years and D exploited V’s emotional vulnerability by impressing upon her that she would lose a father if anyone learnt about the abuse. Additionally, V has suffered trauma as a result of the persistent sexual abuse.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 In relation to the 2nd to 10th charges, I found that the present case fell within the higher end of Band 2. This was a clear case of abuse of position of trust. D was the biological father of V and  they shared a close relationship when the abuse occurred. When the offences started in 2010, V did not know that they were wrong and hence allowed D to continue to abuse her. When she first confronted D, she was confused but she listened to D (who had told her that he would teach her more about sex). D also stated in P29 (see [94] above) that initially V did not know about sex as she was very young, did not know it was wrong, and hence allowed him to perform the sexual acts. When V realised that the acts were wrong, D then impressed upon her that she would lose her father if anyone found out about the sexual activities. This not only violated the trust placed in him by V but also by society. Further, the vulnerability of V by reason of her age constituted an aggravating factor in a case punishable under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code (see [170] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 There was also some premeditation and the offences were not committed at the spur of the moment. For instance, after the incident forming the 1st charge, D told V that it was “sex” and that he would teach her more along the way. He then started to insert his finger into V’s vagina (the 2nd charge) which gradually led to more egregious forms of sexual penetration such as fellatio and penile-anal penetration. D would abuse V whilst everyone else in the room was asleep or when he was alone with V (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the 5th to 7th charges when V was playing with the “PlayStation”), all the while informing V that she would get used to the sexual activities and to keep quiet or she would risk losing her father. D had also deliberately put himself in a position where he could continue to take advantage of her, such as by sleeping on the same bed as or next to her.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Further, D had subjected V to sexual degradation. The abuse took place over a period of time, with D telling V that she would get used to it or to bear with the pain when he performed penile-anal penetration. He would also ejaculate in V’s mouth and told her to either swallow or spit out his semen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Additionally, there was a lack of remorse on D’s part. During the trial, he chose to raise matters to disparage N’s character unnecessarily, accused N of influencing V to lie, and sought to discredit V by alleging that she had attempted to “cover herself up” because he discovered that she had had sex with her boyfriend which was wrong.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">BSR</span>, the sentence imposed for a fellatio offence punishable under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was 14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

Further, he had forcibly inserted his penis into the victim’s mouth and exposed her to the risk of a sexually transmitted disease. The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment. Although the victim in <span class="font-italic">BSR</span> was younger, it could not be said that the present case was less egregious.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>In particular, the accused had pleaded guilty, which was a mitigating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 As for the 11th to 15th charges (punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code) Mr Shafiq submitted that they should fall within Band 1 of <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, albeit at the higher end, as the only aggravating factor was the abuse of position of trust.

</div> The Prosecution maintained that these offences fell within the higher end of Band 2 for essentially the same reasons as with the 2nd to 10th charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the 11th to 15th charges fell within the higher end of Band 2 of <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> for the reasons at [172] to [175] above, namely that there was an abuse of position of trust, premeditation on D’s part, V’s vulnerability as she was still relatively young at the material time, the sexual degradation V was subjected to and D’s lack of remorse. As such, I imposed a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum 12 strokes of the cane for each of the 2nd to 10th charges, and 13 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for each of the 11th to 15th charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 I ordered the 1st, 4th and 13th charges (which pertained to three different occasions of sexual abuse) to run consecutively. D’s total sentence was thus 29 years’ imprisonment (to commence from the date of D’s remand) and the maximum 24 strokes of the cane in accordance with s 328 of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 In <span class="font-italic">BSR</span>, the total sentence imposed (and upheld by the Court of Appeal) was 25.5 years of imprisonment for a plea of guilt on four charges (which included a charge of fellatio punishable under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code and a charge of aggravated outrage of modesty of a minor under s 354A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)) with four other charges taken into consideration; albeit relating to more than one victim. In <span class="font-italic">PP v BRH</span> [2020] SGHC 14, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code by penetrating the victim’s vagina with his penis (punishable under s 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as the victim was then eight to nine years old), and an offence each of penile-anal penetration and fellatio punishable under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). Twelve other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing, including, a charge of outrage of modesty by rubbing the victim’s vagina over her clothes when she was between six and seven years old, punishable under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. The court imposed a total of 28 years’ imprisonment and the maximum 24 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Here, D had claimed trial to 15 charges altogether. In imposing a total of 29 years’ imprisonment, the sentences were calibrated to take into account that there were several distinct occasions in which the offences occurred with different acts of penetration. However, some of the charges pertained to the same occasion, and I calibrated the overall sentence having regard to the totality principle and that it should not be excessive or crushing. Nevertheless, general deterrence and retribution were key considerations in the present case. Particularly, this was a case of an abuse of trust of the highest order by a father of his biological daughter, and there were no mitigating circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim  <br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Lee Yee Leng, Goh Yi Ling and Colin Ng Guan Wen (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Mohammad Shafiq bin Haja Maideen, <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Yamuna Balakrishnan </span>and Abdul Rahman bin Mohd Hanipah (Abdul Rahman Law Corporation) for the Defence. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
