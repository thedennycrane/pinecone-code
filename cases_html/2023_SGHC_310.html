They were each convicted and sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment. The appellants filed their respective appeals against both conviction and sentence. At the hearing on 26 July 2023, I dismissed the appeals against conviction and allowed the appeals against sentence, lowering their sentences to 12 months’ imprisonment, delivering a detailed oral judgment. These are my grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In these grounds, I will address the appellants in HC/MA 9108/2021/01 and HC/MA 9109/2021/01 – Ching Hwa Ming (Qin Huaming) and Li Keng Wan (Liu Qingyuan) – as “Jason” and “David”, respectively. I will address the respondent as “the Prosecution”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The false story</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Jason and David were the director and manager, respectively, of Nam Hong Engineering Pte Ltd (“NHE”). Jason and David were close friends for more than 30 years. David had worked for Jason in Nam Hong Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd sometime in 2004 or 2005. Eventually, David introduced Jason to one Lian Cher Hong (Lian Zhihong), whom I will address as “Aloysius”. Jason and Aloysius incorporated NHE, a construction company that specialised in air-conditioning works, in 2010. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Both Aloysius and Jason were equal shareholders in NHE and the only directors. Notably, the directors were joint signatories to NHE’s bank account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In September 2012, NHE secured a subcontract from Kurihara Kogyo Co Ltd (“KK”) for the “Supply and Installation of Chilled Water and Condensate Drain Pipeworks c/w Testing and Commissioning” for the Fusionopolis Project (the “FP Project”). This contract was valued at $5.2m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In 2013, NHE faced some cash flow issues. Aloysius’s father-in-law loaned $300,000 to NHE. Aloysius sought repayment of the loan subsequently. However, Jason refused as he felt that NHE needed to conserve cash to prepare for “rainy days”. In or around the middle of 2014 – about a year and a half after securing the FP Project – Aloysius told David that NHE needed to pay $300,000 to the then Assistant General Manager of KK, Mr Ng Boon Hwa (“Mr Ng”) for allegedly procuring KK to award the FP Project to NHE. Aloysius requested David to convey this to Jason.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Unbeknown to David, what Aloysius told him was false. There was no arrangement between Mr Ng and Aloysius as asserted. Aloysius had concocted the story purportedly for the purpose of repaying the loan to his father-in-law. Aloysius approached David because David was close to Jason, and Aloysius was not. Aloysius was hopeful that David would be able to persuade Jason to agree to make the payment to Mr Ng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 David conveyed the false story to Jason. Jason believed it and eventually, the appellants agreed to pay the $300,000 in two equal tranches. In accordance with NHE’s internal processes, the appellants and Aloysius signed two payment vouchers for $150,000 each, and Jason and Aloysius signed on the corresponding cheques (dated 14 July 2014 and 29 September 2014) that drew on NHE’s bank account. Notably, the cheques were cash cheques and the payment vouchers – payment voucher no. 2000 and no. 2149 – carried the descriptions “Entertainment” and “Contra A/C”, respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 There was no need for David to sign the payment vouchers. However, he did so because he was the overall in-charge of operations in NHE and Jason trusted him. Unless David verified payment and signed the relevant payment voucher, Jason would not sign the payment voucher and authorise payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The cheques were handed over to Aloysius. However, the sum of $300,000 was never paid by Aloysius to his father-in-law. Nor was it paid to Mr Ng. Instead, unknown to Jason and David, Aloysius deposited the cheques into his personal bank account and used the money for his personal expenses. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Jason’s 2017 CPIB report</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In 2017, Jason made a report (the “Report”) against Aloysius and David to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (the “CPIB”). In the Report, Jason alleged a conspiracy between David, Aloysius and various subcontractors of NHE to defraud and cheat him and NHE. There were almost $2m of unpaid invoices due from KK to NHE for work that had been long completed. Yet Aloysius and David took no steps to recover this sum from KK, and instead abandoned NHE leaving Jason to manage the affairs of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Jason asserted that the only plausible explanation for this “completely illogical behaviour” was that David and Aloysius had conspired with KK and the subcontractors of NHE to attempt to wind up NHE before it was able to pursue a claim against KK for the $2m in unpaid invoices. He believed that the sum of $300,000 was used to further the conspiracy. It is notable that when the Report was filed, Jason was unaware that Aloysius’s story was false and that the sum of $300,000 had been pocketed by Aloysius. The Report triggered investigations, and the subsequent prosecution of Aloysius and the appellants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The status of Aloysius’s prosecution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Aloysius initially faced two charges of corruptly receiving gratification of $150,000 for the benefit of Mr Ng. These charges were subsequently amended to two charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “Penal Code”) by deceiving Jason and David into believing that NHE had to pay a bribe to Mr Ng to advance the NHE’s business interests with KK. Aloysius was tried and convicted on the amended charges in separate proceedings and received a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 His appeal against conviction and sentence was also dismissed on 22 February 2023.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In convicting the appellants in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Li Keng Wan (Liu Qingyuan) and another </span>[2021] SGDC 156 (the “GD”), the District Judge (the “DJ”) placed weight on the appellants’ long statement to the CPIB. He found that the long statements were voluntarily made and admissible in evidence (at [45] of the GD). The appellants, however, took issue with the accuracy of the long statements (at [47] of the GD). The DJ found that the recording officers were credible witnesses and did not have any reason to lie about the accuracy of the long statements and the manner in which they were recorded. On the other hand, David was found to be an unreliable witness because of the inconsistencies in his long statements and his evidence in court (at [73]–[74] of the GD). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Furthermore, the DJ held that the four elements for the corruption charge were made out for both appellants. First, the appellants had agreed to give the gratification to Mr Ng. Second, the sum of $300,000 was an inducement to advance NHE’s business interests. Third, there was an objectively corrupt element in respect of the three purposes identified by the DJ (at [85] of the GD): (a) to pay Mr Ng for the award of the FP Project to NHE; (b) to avoid difficulties in receiving progress payments for the FP Project; and (c) to avoid Mr Ng causing NHE difficulties in relation to the Duo Ophir-Rochor Mixed Development (“Duo Ophir”) and Changi Airport Terminal 4 (“Terminal 4”) projects. Fourth, the appellants had the requisite guilty knowledge that their acts were corrupt. Relatedly, the DJ also found that it was not necessary for the gratification to be received by the intended beneficiary for the charge to be made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Additionally, the DJ found that the appellants engaged in a conspiracy amounting to abetment to corruptly give a gratification of $300,000 to Mr Ng to advance NHE’s interests with KK and approved the release of the said sums from NHE’s bank account pursuant to this conspiracy (at [112] of the GD). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 On sentence, the DJ found that the relevant sentencing considerations were deterrence and retribution. He held that a custodial sentence was warranted. The DJ applied the framework in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Syed </span><span class="font-italic">Mostofa Romel </span>[2015] 3 SLR 1166 (“<span class="font-italic">Romel</span>”) (the “<span class="font-italic">Romel </span>framework”) and imposed a global sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment for each appellant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Jason’s case on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Jason raised three challenges on appeal against conviction. First, he took issue with the accuracy of his long statements. In particular, Jason alleged that the DJ erred in finding that he had the same understanding of the term “kopi money” in 2014 as he did in 2017 (when his long statements were recorded). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Jason made four further submissions on the DJ’s reliance on his long statements. First, the DJ erred in finding that the police were inherently honest and unmotivated to lie. Second, the procedural requirements in s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”) as set out in <span class="font-italic">Parti Liyani v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] SGHC 187 (“<span class="font-italic">Parti Liyani</span>”) were not satisfied. Third, the DJ erred in according full weight to the incriminatory portions of the long statements while rejecting Jason’s allegations of a conspiracy against him by David, Aloysius, KK and some other entities. Fourth, the DJ erred by refusing to admit Jason’s affidavit filed in winding up proceedings against NHE, which was contrary to s 262 of the CPC. Section 262 permits the court to allow, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>a sworn affidavit to be used as evidence in criminal proceedings in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21  Second, Jason challenged each of the four elements for the offence under s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the PCA. Third, Jason challenged the DJ’s finding of a conspiracy. In respect of sentence, Jason argued that the custodial threshold had not been crossed and sought a fine of $100,000 instead. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">David’s case on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 David raised five contentions on appeal against conviction. First, he argued that there were inaccuracies in his long statements. Specifically, the term “kopi money” was added to his long statements even though he did not use that term. Notably, he did not allege that he was not aware that it was not present in his long statements. In any event, even if David had used that term, he believed that it referred to money that had been used for entertaining clients. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Second, David alleged that he lacked proficiency in English and consequently his long statements could not be relied upon. Third, as he was a mere employee with no decision-making power in NHE, the requisite <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> was not made out. Fourth, David had nothing to gain from the transaction. Finally, David argued that there was no inducement and no objectively corrupt element in the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In respect of sentence, David submitted that 16 months’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive and the framework in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] SGHC 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span>”) should apply. David sought a fine not exceeding $50,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prosecution’s case on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Prosecution’s case on conviction was that the long statements were accurately recorded and should be relied upon, the elements of the charge were established, and the appellants had conspired to corruptly gratify Mr Ng. On sentence, the Prosecution submitted that the <span class="font-italic">Romel</span> framework was applicable. Applying Category 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Romel </span>framework, the Prosecution urged the court to uphold the global sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment imposed by the DJ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues that were determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 There were four issues that arose in respect of both appeals: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the appellants’ long statements were accurately recorded and could be relied upon (“Issue 1”); </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the four elements of the charges were made out (“Issue 2”); </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether there was a conspiracy to commit the corrupt acts (“Issue 3”); and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) if the appeals against conviction were dismissed, what the appropriate sentences should be (“Issue 4”).</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: The appellants’ long statements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I dismissed the appellants’ challenges to their long statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As mentioned above at [19], Jason’s main contention was that, in 2014 – when the alleged gratification took place – he did not understand “kopi money” to refer to a bribe. Instead, he was under the impression that “kopi money” was a refundable deposit that would eventually be returned to NHE. It was only in 2017 that Jason associated the term “kopi money” with a bribe. This realisation came when Jason was in the process of making the Report in 2017. Thus, he submitted that the DJ was incorrect to find on the basis of his long statements that he knew in 2014 that the sum of $300,000 was to be paid as a bribe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 However, the DJ’s finding was not inconsistent with the material objective evidence, which is when appellate intervention is usually warranted: see <span class="font-italic">ADF v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2010] 1 SLR 874 (“<span class="font-italic">ADF</span>”) at [16(b)]. In his long statement dated 9 January 2018 (“P37”), Jason stated that the appellants knew at the material time that it was an offence to make the payments to Mr Ng as they were bribes. There was no reference to "kopi money" there. In fact, in the same long statement, Jason also stated that another reason for making the payments was that the FP Project was ongoing, and the appellants did not want to offend Mr Ng. They feared that if Mr Ng was not paid, he would hold back progress payments, or generally be difficult in relation to the operations of the FP Project and the other two projects that KK had awarded to NHE (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Duo Ophir and Terminal 4 projects). I therefore saw no basis for appellate intervention. The DJ was entitled to rely on the long statements to support his finding that Jason was aware the payments were bribes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The other contentions raised by Jason, as specified at [20] above, were also dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 First, the DJ did not proceed on the basis that <span class="font-italic">every member</span> of the police was inherently honest and unmotivated to lie. Instead, he carefully assessed the internal and external consistency of the recording officers’ evidence and found them to be credible witnesses; his finding was not against the weight of the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, there was no question of breach of s 22 of the CPC. Section 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC requires a statement to be interpreted in a language that the person making the statement understands. In <span class="font-italic">Parti Liyani</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the High Court found that the recording officer ought to have read back the relevant statements in Bahasa Indonesia, the language used by the accused person in that case, as opposed to Bahasa Melayu (at [71], [75] and [86]). The recording officers and Jason communicated in Mandarin and Jason accepted that he had no issue communicating in that language. Jason also made amendments to his first long statement, P31. This suggested that he could understand what was being interpreted to him. As Jason understood what was being explained to him in Mandarin, there was no breach of s 22. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Third, the DJ did not err by declining to accept Jason’s allegations of a conspiracy against him that were made in the winding up proceedings against NHE. They were not relevant to the corruption charges he faced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Finally, the DJ’s refusal to admit Jason’s affidavit filed in the winding up proceedings against NHE did not breach s 262 of the CPC. The plain language of s 262 indicates that it is permissive and not mandatory. At trial, counsel for Jason submitted that the affidavit was relevant to demonstrate that Jason had been consistent in his understanding of what the money would be used for. However, Jason testified on this very issue, and it was difficult to see what evidential value the affidavit would have had if Jason’s direct testimony on the same issue asserted the very same position set out in the affidavit. Thus, the DJ did not err in refusing to admit the affidavit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 David raised two points to challenge the accuracy of his long statements namely, that: (a) the term “kopi money” had not come from him, he did not understand what it meant, and it was written down by the recording officer in David’s long statement dated 5 June 2017 (“P32”) (see [22] above); and (b) he was not proficient in English, and this affected the accuracy of his long statements. I dismissed both allegations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The first point did not bring David’s case far. The fact that he did not use the term “kopi money” himself in P32 was not relevant. What was pertinent was that in the same long statement, he stated that he knew the payment of the money was wrong under the law and nonetheless went ahead to pay because he was told to do so. The accuracy of this part of P32 was not challenged on appeal. It also contradicted David’s alternative submission that even if he had used the term “kopi money”, he believed that it referred to expenses incurred in entertaining clients. Thus, regardless of the specific words used, the important point was that David knew that the payment was wrong in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As regards the second point, David accepted in P32 and at trial that he could understand and converse in English. Moreover, the DJ highlighted at [68] of his GD that David demonstrated his proficiency in English when he gave evidence in court. The DJ was therefore entitled to come to the view that David was sufficiently proficient in English to understand his long statements.

Jason’s contentions that he was not involved in the day-to-day operations of NHE’s business, and did not have a dishonest or guilty mind, were not relevant at this stage of the inquiry. The <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> was established on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It was not necessary for the gratification to have been received by Mr Ng. In <span class="font-italic">Tang Keng Boon v Public Prosecutor</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 104, the appellant intended to pay money to police officers through two intermediaries in exchange for receiving information on impending police raids. The court found at [37] that it was not a defence that the intermediaries “never intended to pass the money on to police officers and that the whole scheme was said to be a fraud on the appellant”. The fact that the gratification was not received by the police officers did not impact the assessment of whether the offence was made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Thus, the first element was made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Element 2 – Inducement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The second element was made out. This element relates to the causal, or consequential, link between the gratification and the act the gratification was intended to procure (or reward): see <span class="font-italic">Tey</span><span class="font-italic"> Tsun Hang </span>at [16]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The appellants contended that inducement was not proven on the facts. Jason argued that knowing that the sum of $300,000 would be used to advance NHE’s interest did not mean that he knew that he was giving a bribe or engaging in some corrupt act. David argued that there was no inducement as all the projects were awarded through a legitimate tender process. However, the appellants’ long statements contradicted their submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As stated above, at [29], Jason said in P37 that one of the purposes of the payments was to avert the possibility of Mr Ng holding back progress payments owed to NHE or making things difficult for NHE’s operations in the FP Project and other projects that had been awarded to NHE by KK. Similarly, in his long statement dated 9 January 2018 (“P34”), David said that he told Jason that Aloysius had talked about Mr Ng requiring payment for procuring the award of the FP Project to NHE. He further said that Jason “definitely … told me that he is agreeable to pay this money”. It was apparent therefore that the appellants had agreed to give gratification to induce Mr Ng to achieve the three purposes identified by the DJ (see [16] above) The appellants had agreed to give the gratification for the specified benefits; the second element was therefore made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Element 3 – A corrupt element</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 There was a corrupt element here. This is an “objective inquiry that is essentially based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man”: see <span class="font-italic">Chan Wing Seng </span>at [20]. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Low Tiong Choon </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 119 laid down a two-step test (at [29]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the first step is to ascertain the intention of the giver or receiver (as the case may be) to the transaction at the material time. This inquiry depends on the evidence of the parties as well as the surrounding circumstances; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the second step is to then ask whether such an intention tainted the transaction with an objectively corrupt element, given the factual matrix. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The first step could be answered with reference to the finding under the second element of the test. In that vein, the intention of the appellants was to achieve the three purposes as stated at [16] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On the second step, in light of the factual matrix of this case, the intention tainted the transaction with an objectively corrupt element. David referred to <span class="font-italic">Tjong Mark Edward v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2015] 3 SLR 375 (“<span class="font-italic">Tjong Mark Edward</span>”), at [27] and [29], to contend that the evidence must at least allow the court to infer that the idea of giving gratification was already operating in David’s mind at the time of the alleged favour (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the award of the FP Project to NHE). David’s submission was that he was not involved in the agreement to give the gratification at the time the FP Project was awarded and so this element could not be made out. I did not accept his argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53  The principles that David cited from <span class="font-italic">Tjong Mark Edward</span> did not apply squarely to the facts of this case. I reproduce the relevant portions of the case here:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 … <span class="font-italic">It is quite clear that the lack of an agreement does not prevent a finding of corruption.</span> The lack of a discussion is also not fatal in unusual cases like this. Corruption is often subtle and hard to detect<span class="font-italic">. It would be undesirable if the mere lack of a discussion or agreement is fatal to a finding of </span><span class="font-italic">corruption, since many instances of corruption could then be disguised as rewards after the event</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27 However, I doubt that the objective corrupt element would be satisfied if there was no agreement, discussion, contemplation or expectation of gratification when the allegedly corrupt conduct happened and if no favour was in fact shown. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28 I believe that what I have suggested is consistent with the existing jurisprudence. Two local cases support the proposition that <span class="font-italic">it is not corrupt to reward someone for doing what he was already supposed to do</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29 It is also useful to recall the natural meaning of corruption, which is the “[p]erversion of a person’s integrity in the performance of … duty or work by bribery etc” (<span class="font-italic">Chan Wing Seng</span> at [26]). To prove corruption in cases where gratification was received <span class="font-italic">after</span> the allegedly corrupt conduct had happened, the evidence must at least allow the court to infer that the idea of gratification was already operating in the accused’s mind. There must be some “advantage gained or hoped to be gained by the giver” (see <span class="font-italic">Sairi bin Sulaiman v PP</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 794 at [40]). … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 <span class="font-italic">I stress that the foregoing analysis assumes a one-off dealing</span>. It might still be corruption if, for example, Tjong and Mujibur continued to have dealings; the gratification might encourage Tjong to favour Mujibur in later dealings in derogation of his duties to STE. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Mark Edward</span> at [26] found that the mere absence of an agreement or discussion does not militate against the finding of corruption. In <span class="font-italic">Tjong Mark Edward</span> at [28], it was said that “it is not corrupt to reward someone for doing what he was already supposed to do”. That was not what transpired here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Although Aloysius had concocted the false story <span class="font-italic">after</span> the award of the FP Project, the motivation behind the payment of the sum of $300,000 was to gratify Mr Ng for awarding the FP Project in accordance with the purported arrangement between him and Aloysius – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first purpose – and to further NHE’s other business interests moving forward (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the second and third purposes). By doing so, the appellants had adopted and affirmed what they understood to be the arrangement between Aloysius and Mr Ng as regards the award of the FP Project (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first purpose). Their concern was that the failure to keep to that arrangement would have downstream consequences both of which concerned the second and third purposes. As such, David’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Tjong Mark Edward </span>was misplaced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Thus, the third element was made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Element 4 – Guilty knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The fourth element was satisfied. This element poses a subjective test with an inherent objective element “in that the guilty knowledge was that of knowing or realising that what [the accused] did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard”: see <span class="font-italic">Fong Ser Joo William v Public Prosecutor </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 12 at [33]. A surreptitious attempt to legitimise the gratification is indicative of guilty knowledge: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Tze Chye v Public Prosecutor</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 357 at [45]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Jason raised various contentions on appeal; they primarily related to the contention that he was not aware that it was corrupt to pay Mr Ng the sum of $300,000 so that Mr Ng would not make things difficult for NHE. Jason also contended that he thought it was not corrupt to give Mr Ng the said sum if NHE was going to receive money from KK which was legitimately owed to it. However, the facts did not support his contentions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, the appellants were aware that the gratification was a bribe. In P37, Jason said that the appellants knew that giving the sum of $300,000 was an offence but nonetheless went ahead to make the payment. Similarly, in P32, David accepted that he knew that it was not legal to pay the said sum but chose to do so anyway. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, the two payment vouchers signed by the appellants and Aloysius did not state the true purpose of the payments. As noted above at [8], payment voucher no. 2000 dated 14 July 2014 described the payment as “Entertainment”. This was false. Payment voucher no. 2149 dated 29 September 2014 described the payment as “Contra A/C”. Again, this was false. In P32, David accepted that genuine entertainment expenses would be accompanied by receipts attached to the payment voucher. There were no receipts attached to payment voucher no. 2000 for an obvious reason: the payment was the gratification the appellants intended to pay Mr Ng. The false descriptions of the payments in the payment vouchers spoke to the appellants’ guilty knowledge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I make a further point. As noted earlier, the cheques were cash cheques. This ensured that the identity of the payee was not apparent from the cheques. No satisfactory explanation was offered by the appellants before the DJ as to why cash cheques were issued. That further underscored the conclusion that the appellants wanted to hide the true purpose of the payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Thus, the fourth element was made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Therefore, the four elements for the corruption charge under s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the PCA were made out. I turn to consider whether there was a conspiracy to commit the corrupt acts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Conspiracy to commit the corrupt acts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The essence of a conspiracy is an agreement or a common design: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span><span class="font-italic">v Yeo Choon Poh</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 302 at [19]. The conspirators do not have to be equally informed of all the details of the conspiracy. However, they must at the minimum be aware of the general purpose of the plot and that plot must be unlawful: see <span class="font-italic">Nomura Taiji and others v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 259 at [110]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Jason submitted that the Prosecution did not establish that there was a conspiracy between the appellants with the same general purpose. Moreover, he submitted that he had believed that it was not corrupt to give the moneys to KK if he was going to receive money which was legitimately owed to NHE. I note that the latter submission was made in the context of a conspiracy though it ought to have been made in relation to the element of a guilty knowledge. In view of this, I addressed this submission at [57]–[62] above. In any event, I did not accept both of Jason’s contentions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The evidence supported the conclusion that the appellants agreed to make the payments for the three purposes specified above (see [16] above). Thus, there was a conspiracy amounting to abetment to corruptly gratify Mr Ng within the meaning of s 107(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Therefore, I dismissed the appeals against conviction. I turn to discuss the fourth issue – the appeals against sentence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Grounds for appellate intervention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 An appellate court may intervene on sentence in four instances (see <span class="font-italic">ADF </span>at [17]): </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) where the trial judge erred in respect of the proper factual basis for sentencing;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) where the trial judge failed to appreciate the material placed before the court;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) where the sentence imposed by the trial judge was wrong in principle; or </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) where the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Here, the second and third grounds were salient grounds for appellate intervention on sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 With regard to the second ground, it may be said that a trial judge has failed to appreciate the material placed before the court if he or she makes a finding of fact which is not supported by the evidence: see <span class="font-italic">Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at [48] and [93]. I found that in applying the <span class="font-italic">Romel </span>framework, the DJ failed to appreciate the material placed before the court on David’s case. As noted earlier, the transactions were made for the three purposes specified above at [16]. The DJ, at [142] of the GD, found that for the purposes of sentencing “it was <span class="font-italic">not in dispute</span> that the present case was a private sector corruption case which fell within the first category of cases stated in <span class="font-italic">Romel</span>” [emphasis added]. Contrary to the DJ’s finding, this was a disputed issue at trial. In David’s Sentencing Submissions dated 2 December 2020, he submitted that while the first purpose behind the transaction would rightly fall under Category 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Romel</span> framework, the second and third purposes ought to fall under Category 3 of the <span class="font-italic">Romel </span>framework. This was the same position taken by David during oral submissions on sentence. Indeed, for the reasons canvassed below at [81]–[85], I found that the second and third purposes did fall under Category 3 of the <span class="font-italic">Romel </span>framework. Thus, the DJ failed to properly appreciate the submissions on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Moreover, the sentence imposed was wrong in principle. A sentence would be wrong in principle when, amongst other reasons, the lower court incorrectly accords weight to aggravating and mitigating factors: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v UI </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (“<span class="font-italic">UI</span>”) at [76]. The concern in such cases is that the sentence imposed would breach the principle of consistency in sentencing: see <span class="font-italic">UI</span> at [75]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The DJ applied the wrong sentencing principle on two occasions: (a) by giving credit to the appellants for not having any related criminal antecedents (at [157] of the GD); and (b) in finding that the appellants’ act of claiming trial suggested that they had no remorse which justified an uplift to their sentence (at [159] of the GD). I deal with each in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 First, it was wrong to discount the sentence simply because of the lack of related antecedents – this was merely a neutral factor: see <span class="font-italic">BPH v Public Prosecutor</span> <span class="font-italic">and another appeal</span> [2019] 2 SLR 764 at [85]. Second, it was incorrect to treat the act of claiming trial as <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> grounds for finding a lack of remorse which could aggravate the sentence: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri and others</span> [2020] 4 SLR 790 (“<span class="font-italic">Ridhaudin</span>”) at [56]. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BLV</span> [2020] 3 SLR 166, at [135], the High Court held that “even in relation to sexual offences, an accused person’s claiming trial does not in itself expose him to any additional uplift or increase in sentence, but rather connotes merely that he does not qualify for a discount for pleading guilty”. In <span class="font-italic">Ridhaudin</span>, the High Court held, at [57], that “a relatively high threshold must be met for this to be an offender-specific aggravating factor, such as where the accused conducts his defence in an extravagant and unnecessary manner or makes scandalous allegations in respect of the victim”. Here, the appellants claimed trial on the basis they had been deceived by Aloysius’s false story. This was not a case that was extravagant or unnecessary such that an uplift was warranted. The DJ did not explain why the appellants claiming trial met this high threshold. Further, there was nothing in the manner in which the defence was conducted at trial that warranted an uplift. Indeed, the Prosecution did not make this submission before the DJ in their written or oral submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Therefore, there were two grounds for appellate intervention on sentence: the DJ’s failure to appreciate the material placed before the court, and the imposition of a sentence which was wrong in principle. The next question is what the applicable sentencing framework ought to be. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable sentencing framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Prosecution submitted that the <span class="font-italic">Romel </span>framework should apply. On the other hand, the appellants submitted that the framework in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span> should apply. I briefly outline the two frameworks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In <span class="font-italic">Romel</span>, the court categorised sentences into three broad and non-exhaustive categories (at [26]). Category 1 applies where the receiving party receives gratification or is paid a reward to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. Category 2 applies where the receiving party receives gratification or is paid a reward to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Category 3 applies where a receiving party receives gratification or is paid a reward so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. Under the <span class="font-italic">Romel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>framework, the “court must correctly locate the facts of the case, including the circumstances of the offender that is before it within the continuum of the facts in previously decided cases before coming to a conclusion as to the appropriate sentence”: see <span class="font-italic">Romel</span> at [31].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In respect of Category 1, whether the custodial threshold is crossed depends on the facts. Category 2 cases frequently attract custodial sentences. For Category 3 cases, the court in <span class="font-italic">Romel</span> explained that the receiving party, as opposed to the paying party, tends to have heightened culpability due to the presence of two factors: first, in seeking payment from the paying party; and second, by threatening to inflict harm on the paying party if the bribe is not paid when there is no lawful basis for doing so. These factors result in the deprivation of the paying party’s legitimate rights unless he pays a bribe: see <span class="font-italic">Romel</span> at [27]–[29]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In comparison, the framework in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span> was for private sector corruption offences under ss 6(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 6(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PCA. It is modelled after the two-stage, five-step framework in <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span><span class="font-italic"> Vladislav v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 4 SLR 609 (see <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng </span>at [45]–[47]). At the first stage, the court arrives at an indicative starting point sentence for the offender which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the offending act. This first stage involves three steps: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the court identifies, by reference to factors specific to the particular offence under consideration, (i) the level of harm caused by the offence and (ii) the level of the offender’s culpability;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the court identifies the applicable indicative sentencing range by reference to the level of harm caused by the offence and the level of the offender’s culpability; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the court identifies the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range that was identified in step two. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 At the second stage, the court makes adjustments to the starting point sentence identified under the first stage and arrives at a sentence that reflects the personal circumstances of the offender, by taking into account the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating circumstances unique to the offender and considering if the sentence arrived at is proportionate and consistent with the overall criminality of the offender. This stage consists of two steps: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The court makes adjustments to the identified starting point as may be necessary to take into account factors personal to the offender’s particular circumstances (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, offender-specific factors).</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Where an offender has been convicted of multiple charges, the court considers if further adjustments should be made to the sentence for the individual charges to take into account the totality principle. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I found that the <span class="font-italic">Romel</span> framework applied in this case. The court in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span> expressly limited the framework there to cases arising under s 6 of the PCA for the reasons expressed in the judgment. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span> highlighted, ss 5 and 6 of the PCA are directed at distinct mischiefs and therefore engage different considerations in the sentencing exercise: see <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng </span>at [50]–[51]. Further, a sentencing matrix would ordinarily be calibrated based on sentences for the same offences in the past. It follows that the sentencing matrix in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span> would have been based on data involving sentences under s 6 and not s 5 of the PCA. I did not have the data for offences under s 5 of the PCA and there was no evidence to suggest that the data sets in respect of both provisions were the same. It was, thus, not apparent why it was appropriate for the framework in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span> to be mapped over to this case. Nevertheless, I accepted that the offence-specific factors going towards harm and culpability, as outlined in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span> at [95], were relevant to cases under s 5 of the PCA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Thus, I applied the <span class="font-italic">Romel </span>framework to the facts in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I found that the first purpose fell within Category 1, and the latter two purposes within Category 3 of the <span class="font-italic">Romel </span>framework. The first purpose – to pay Mr Ng for the award of the FP Project to NHE – involved paying Mr Ng a reward for a contract which was within his power to award. This purpose fell squarely within Category 1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The latter two purposes evinced the appellants’ concern that Mr Ng would act in a manner that would hurt NHE’s interests (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by withholding progress payments already due to NHE and by making things difficult for NHE in relation to other projects). The Prosecution submitted that these purposes shaded into Category 2 since the gratifications were for the purpose of getting Mr Ng “to act in a manner that was derelict in his duty; i.e., to refrain from withholding progress payments to NHE regardless of whether there were grounds for KK to withhold them … and for [Mr Ng] not to make things difficult or to slacken in his oversight of NHE”. However, this was not an accurate reflection of the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Category 2 relates to paying the receiving party to forbear from performing what he is <span class="font-italic">duty bound</span> to do. There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the appellants’ motivation was to get Mr Ng to avoid taking actions that he was duty bound to take. Rather, the concern appeared to be to avoid a situation where Mr Ng would go out of his way to (a) stop progress payments that were due and payable to NHE in relation to the FP Project, and (b) make things difficult for NHE’s other projects. It must be remembered that the second and third purposes were tied to the first purpose in that the appellants were concerned that the failure to pay the sum of $300,000 to Mr Ng for the award of the FP Project (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the first purpose) would have downstream consequences for NHE which they sought to avoid, namely the second and third purposes. This was supported by the objective evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In P37, Jason stated that he and David “did not want to offend [Mr Ng]. If we did not give the money demanded by [Mr Ng], he could hold back our progressive payments [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] or make things difficult in our operations”. In P34, David stated that Aloysius told him that NHE could have “difficulty getting progress payments through [Mr Ng] and [Mr Ng] could also make things difficult for us for the other projects.” These statements suggested that the appellants were concerned that Mr Ng might disrupt payments that were rightfully owed to NHE, and also make things difficult for NHE in respect of other ongoing projects. Indeed, as regards the second purpose (relating to the progress payments under the FP Project), the DJ found that the payments were to be made “to [Mr Ng] for him to <span class="font-italic">refrain from showing disfavour</span> to NHE by <span class="font-italic">withholding</span> progress payments to NHE in relation to the FP project” [emphasis added] (at [95] of the GD). Notably, most of the progress payments had been paid and the works for the FP Project were about to come to an end by the time Aloysius had concocted the false story of Mr Ng demanding the $300,000. This was not a case, as the Prosecution suggested, where the gratification was given to Mr Ng to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, procure him to forbear from going through the proper processes when assessing if progress payments were payable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In view of the evidence, the first purpose for the gratification fell under Category 1 and the latter two purposes fell under Category 3 of the <span class="font-italic">Romel</span> framework.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I then considered the offence-specific factors going towards harm and culpability as set out in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng</span> at [95]. The harm here was the public disquiet caused by the offence in that corrupt acts impact society’s expectations that transactions and decisions in both the private and public spheres will be carried out fairly and transparently: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng and another appeal</span> [2020] 5 SLR 807<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [67]. There was no harm caused to KK since the gratification was never paid to Mr Ng as Aloysius had concocted the story. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The factors relating to culpability were the quantum of the gratification, the degree of pre-meditation, and both the appellants’ abuse of their respective positions within NHE. First, the quantum involved – the sum of $300,000 – was substantial. Second, there was a significant degree of pre-meditation. The appellants had consciously attempted to conceal the two transactions by miscrediting them as “Entertainment” and “Contra A/C” in the payment vouchers and using cash cheques (see [60]–[61] above). Moreover, by issuing cash cheques, the appellants had hidden the identity of the payee. In the circumstances, I found that there was a material degree of pre-meditation in giving the gratification. Lastly, the appellants had abused their respective positions in the company; Jason was a director who had signed on the payment vouchers and the corresponding cheques; David’s signature on the payment vouchers led to Jason following his lead and agreeing to sign on them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In assessing the appropriate sentence, I considered in particular the decisions of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Geow Chwee Hiam</span> [2016] SGDC 139 (“<span class="font-italic">Geow</span><span class="font-italic"> Chwee Hiam</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor v Soh Yew Meng</span> DAC-933429-2015 (7 February 2017) (District Court, Singapore) (<span class="font-italic">“Soh Yew Meng</span>”), and <span class="font-italic">Kannan s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Kunjiraman and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 294 (“<span class="font-italic">Kannan</span>”). I was cognisant that <span class="font-italic">Geow</span><span class="font-italic"> Chwee Hiam </span>and<span class="font-italic"> Soh Yew Meng </span>involved s 6(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCA. However, they served as a useful guide to how the sentence should be calibrated as those cases applied <span class="font-italic">Romel </span>and not <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In <span class="font-italic">Geow</span><span class="font-italic"> Chwee Hiam</span>, the accused pleaded guilty to three charges under s 6(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCA and consented to five similar charges being taken into consideration in sentencing. The accused, the director and head of a company, Island Landscape &amp; Nursery Pte Ltd (“ILN”), solicited gratification in exchange for furthering the business interests of the giver’s company. The total quantum for the three proceeded charges was $80,000 and the remaining amount in the other five charges was $63,000. The accused received the payments on eight occasions between November 2008 and December 2010. The corrupt acts took place over a long timeframe; there were multiple payments; there was an abuse of power and authority by the accused in respect of ILN; there was planning and premeditation; and the entire case fell within Category 1 of <span class="font-italic">Romel</span>. The global sentence imposed was eight months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The circumstances here were more serious than <span class="font-italic">Geow</span><span class="font-italic"> Chwee Hiam</span>. The two cases were analogous insofar as there was an abuse of power and authority, and planning and premeditation on the facts. Although the gratification took place over a longer period of time in <span class="font-italic">Geow</span><span class="font-italic"> Chwee Hiam</span>, the accused in that case had pleaded guilty and the quantum involved was significantly lower. Even including the charges taken into consideration, the total gratification was $143,000 there, which was less than half the amount in this case. Thus, the sentence here had to be greater than in <span class="font-italic">Geow</span><span class="font-italic"> Chwee Hiam</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In <span class="font-italic">Soh Yew Meng</span>, the accused pleaded guilty to three charges under s 6(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCA for obtaining bribes of $150,000, $150,000, and $15,000. The global sentence imposed was 14 months’ imprisonment. The accused was a Director of the Building Enhancement Department of Resorts World Sentosa Pte Ltd (“RWS”). He had sought gratification from different contractors that were seeking to be awarded projects from RWS. Regarding two of the charges, the accused received $300,000 (in two payments of $150,000 each) from the managing director of one contractor in exchange for information on the bid that the contractor’s competitors would submitting for a project. In respect of the third charge, the accused received $15,000 from the director of another contractor in exchange for awarding one of RWS’s projects to that contractor. There was planning involved in <span class="font-italic">Soh Yew Meng</span>. There was also actual harm because RWS’s tender process was compromised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I agreed with the DJ’s observation that <span class="font-italic">Soh Yew Meng</span> involved a more aggravated factual matrix than the present case (at [160] of the GD). Even accounting for the fact that the accused pleaded guilty in that case, the quantum there was higher, the accused had received bribes from two different sources, and there was a higher degree of sophistication in how the moneys were moved – in respect of the first charge, the accused’s girlfriend had deposited part of the bribe in two of her bank accounts and used part thereof to purchase a condominium where she and the accused lived subsequently. Thus, the sentence in the present case had to be lower than that imposed in <span class="font-italic">Soh Yew Meng</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In <span class="font-italic">Kannan</span>, amongst other charges, the accused faced a charge under s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the PCA for conspiring with one Rajendran to bribe Mr David Lee, Singapore’s then national goalkeeper, to concede goals during a soccer match. The bribe was never paid to Mr David Lee. The quantum involved was significantly lower, at $80,000. The sentence was one year’s imprisonment and a $40,000 fine (in default 4 months’ imprisonment).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 <span class="font-italic">Kannan</span> was relevant here because it was factually analogous in that there was a conspiracy to pay a bribe which did not reach the intended recipient. I noted that the quantum of the gratification in this case was higher than in <span class="font-italic">Kannan</span>. However, there were two points of distinction. First, <span class="font-italic">Kannan</span> pertained to a corruption offence with a strong public interest element. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Kannan</span> had noted that soccer was a sport with a wide following and offences of that nature attracted much public attention (at [24]). In contrast, the present case was one of private sector corruption. Although there is some public disquiet caused by corruption offences in the private sector, the public interest element is arguably not as compelling as in <span class="font-italic">Kannan</span>. The second point of distinction was that the second and third purposes fell under Category 3. This had to factor in the assessment of the appropriate sentence as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In view of the precedents, I found that the sentence in this case should lie between that in <span class="font-italic">Geow</span><span class="font-italic"> Chwee Hiam </span>and <span class="font-italic">Soh Y</span><span class="font-italic">ew Meng</span>. However, given that the quantum here was significantly higher than in <span class="font-italic">Kannan</span>, the sentence in the present case ought not to have been lower than that in <span class="font-italic">Kannan</span>. Considering the harm and culpability factors, as well as the fact that two of the purposes fell under Category 3 of the <span class="font-italic">Romel</span> framework, I sentenced each of the appellants to a global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Therefore, I dismissed the appeals on conviction and allowed the appeals against sentence. The sentence in respect of each appellant was reduced from 16 months’ imprisonment to 12 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Kannan Ramesh<br/>Judge of Appellate Division</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Balachandran Suren Jaesh (Bishop Law Corporation) for the appellant in HC/MA 9108/2021/01;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Ci (Circular Law Chambers LLP) (instructed), Luke Anton Netto and Aylwyn Seto Zi You (Netto &amp; Magin LLC) for the appellant in HC/MA 9109/2021/01;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tay Jingxi, David Menon and Cheng You Duen (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
