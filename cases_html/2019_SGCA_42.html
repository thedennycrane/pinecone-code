While it is usually the prerogative of a litigant to decide on the forum in which to bring his claim, the common law has developed a set of principles and rules to curb forum shopping and to prevent abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this context, it should be recognised that in most situations, whatever is perceived to be advantageous to one litigant would almost invariably be viewed as disadvantageous to the opposing party. Therein lies the inherent tension in any forum selection exercise. Quite often, that tension is resolved by way of procedural orders such as a stay of proceedings and/or an anti-suit injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Indeed, the present appeal before us involves applications made by the appellant for both such procedural orders. The court below dealt with an application for an anti-suit injunction against the continuation of proceedings in the British Virgin Islands (“the BVI”) while the court in the BVI dealt with an application to stay the proceedings in favour of Singapore. Both applications were decided against the appellant at first instance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 However, it may be of some significance that the refusal of the stay application by the BVI court took place <span class="font-italic">after</span> the refusal of the court below to grant the anti-suit injunction <span class="font-italic">while</span> the appeal against that decision was pending hearing. The confluence and sequence of these two decisions have provoked the respondent to raise several interesting arguments to oppose this appeal against the refusal of the court below to grant the anti-suit injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The respondent relies on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the doctrine of issue estoppel and comity to resist this appeal. In essence, the respondent’s case is that “<span class="font-italic">timing is everything</span>”. Given that the BVI court in dismissing the stay application had already made a determination <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the hearing of this appeal that the BVI is the natural forum for the resolution of the respondent’s claim, the respondent suggests that this court should not, on account of issue estoppel and comity, allow the appeal because to do so would involve a contrary finding that Singapore instead of the BVI is the natural forum of the respondent’s claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 We should state at the outset that this is not the first occasion when a court has had to hear an application for an anti-suit injunction to restrain foreign proceedings <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> to a refusal of that same foreign court to stay the foreign proceedings. However, this appears to be the first time in which it has been suggested that a decision not to stay proceedings can give rise to an issue estoppel in respect of a subsequent anti-suit injunction application in the competing forum. In this judgment, we will examine the legitimacy of this novel argument.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material background events</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 We begin with an explanation of the relevant parties and the material background events. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The respondent, Mr Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra, was a family friend of the appellant, Mdm Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar and her late husband, Mr Anil Vassudeva Salgaocar (“Mr Anil”).

Briefly, Mr Anil’s position is that the share transfer was executed in order for the respondent to return the 22 units in Newton Imperial to him, which he alleges was wrongfully conveyed to the Subsidiaries by the respondent. On this account, the transfer is said to constitute an admission by the respondent of an oral agreement between the respondent and Mr Anil which was concluded in 2003 (“the 2003 Agreement”). Under this agreement, the respondent allegedly agreed to hold on trust for Mr Anil the shares of various special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) which would be set up by Mr Anil.

</div> The respondent, on the other hand, denies the existence of the 2003 Agreement. His position is that the 2014 share transfer effected a <span class="font-italic">sale</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of the Share by the respondent to Mr Anil, and therefore evidences a different oral agreement allegedly concluded in 2014 between Mr Anil and himself (“the 2014 Agreement”). Under this agreement, it was allegedly agreed that the Share would be transferred to Mr Anil upon his payment of certain sums to the respondent equivalent to the amounts which the respondent had loaned to MDWL. On this account, the purpose of the 2014 Agreement was to allow Mr Anil to purchase the 22 units in Newton Imperial owned by the Subsidiaries in a manner that would be tax efficient.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 On 1 December 2017, the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) dismissed the appellant’s application for an anti-suit injunction. In dismissing the application, the Judge found that Suit 821 had not been deemed discontinued. On 22 February 2018, the Judge delivered his decision for OS 1293. The Judge’s finding that Suit 821 was not deemed discontinued is not an issue in the present appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The appellant filed the present appeal against the Judge’s dismissal of her application for an anti-suit injunction.

In summary, the Judge was of the view that Singapore was not shown to be the clearly more appropriate forum for the dispute, and that there was insufficient evidence of vexation and oppression on the part of the respondent in commencing BVI 83.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Judge found the BVI to be the natural forum for the respondent’s claim in BVI 83. The relevant connecting factor, in his view, is the subject matter of BVI 83, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Share. This factor pointed to the BVI being the natural forum given that the Share is in MDWL, a BVI-incorporated company, and ownership of the Share would be reflected on MDWL’s register of members (GD at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Judge further found that the appellant had failed to establish that the BVI 83 proceedings were vexatious or oppressive. He found, amongst others, that the risk of inconsistent findings in Suit 821 and BVI 83 constituted an insufficient basis to restrain the respondent from proceeding with his claim in the BVI (GD at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 We would note that central to the Judge’s findings on natural forum and the lack of vexatious or oppressive conduct was his view that the main issues in BVI 83 and Suit 821 are different (GD at [49], [62]). The Judge found that the central issue in BVI 83 is whether the respondent and Mr Anil had concluded the 2014 Agreement <span class="font-italic">and that this is not an issue raised in Suit 821</span>, which concerned instead whether the respondent and Mr Anil had concluded the 2003 Agreement. In the circumstances, the Judge found that while the existence and effect of the 2003 Agreement may also be an issue in BVI 83, the key factual issue in BVI 83 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the existence and effect of the 2014 Agreement) is absent from Suit 821 (GD at [49]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Finally, while the Judge found in favour of the respondent on the issues of natural forum and vexation and oppression, the Judge did not place weight on the respondent’s argument that an anti-suit injunction would deprive him of legitimate juridical advantages in proceeding in the BVI. The Judge was of the view that the respondent had not identified any legitimate juridical advantages associated with proceeding in the BVI that would materially weigh against the grant of an anti-suit injunction (GD at [65]).

It was argued that because the substance of the dispute between the parties concerns the 22 units in Newton Imperial, the dispute is governed by Singapore law, since Singapore is the location of the immovable property and the rental proceeds.

First, it was argued that comity requires this court not to issue the anti-suit injunction given the BVI court’s decision to assume jurisdiction. Second, it was argued that an issue estoppel operates in respect of the issue of the natural forum for the dispute since this issue was argued before and decided by the BVI court.

To begin with, there was no suggestion by either party that the BVI or Singapore court would apply different principles that would affect the outcome of the dispute, particularly since both Singapore and the BVI are common law jurisdictions. We also observe that the key issues in dispute between the parties are factual and not legal in nature since both parties’ cases are dependent on the factual question of whether or which of the oral agreements were concluded. The governing law is of limited relevance for this reason as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 On this note, we agree with the observations made by the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span><span class="font-italic">, Morris &amp; Collins on the Conflict of Laws</span> vol 1 (Lord Collins of Mapesbury gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 12–034 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the legal issues are straightforward, or if the competing fora have domestic laws which are substantially similar, the identity of the governing law will be a factor of rather little significance. But if the legal issues are complex, or the legal systems very different, the general principle that a court applies its own law more reliably than does a foreign court will help to point to the more appropriate forum …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Likewise, Prof Yeo Tiong Min SC made the following observations on the relevance of the governing law of the dispute, with which we would agree (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> <span class="font-italic">- Conflict of Laws</span> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis Singapore, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span>”) at para 75.093): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Within the common law system, there is usually little difficulty in one forum applying the law of another.

Taking the relevant connecting factors into account, we find, on a proper characterisation of the dispute in BVI 83 viewed holistically against the background factual matrix, that Singapore is the natural forum for the dispute for reasons which we will elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parallel proceedings in Singapore and the BVI</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The existence of related or parallel proceedings elsewhere (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>a<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">lis alibi pendens</span>) has been recognised as a valid factor in the identification of the natural forum for the dispute. The weight to be placed on concurrent proceedings in the local and foreign court is dependent on factors including the degree to which both proceedings have advanced and the degree of overlap in both proceedings. We find the following excerpt from <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> to be particularly useful (at para 75.094): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The weight to be given to the fact of existence of parallel proceedings will depend on the circumstances. The degree to which the respective proceedings have advanced is an important consideration; ... The degree of overlap of issues and parties is another consideration. However, little or no weight will be given to [the] fact that there are foreign proceedings if they are commenced for strategic reasons to bolster the case of a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where there has been or is litigation involving very complex facts which call for highly specialised expert evidence, and such expertise has been built up in a particular jurisdiction, that could be a very important indication of the prima facie natural forum. This factor, discussed in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>, came to be known as the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> factor …, is recognised as a highly exceptional factor and has rarely been applied since then.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The risk of conflicting judgments arising from concurrent proceedings is another factor to consider, but it is not decisive and will need to be weighed with other factors. If it is a straight competition between proceedings in the forum and proceedings elsewhere, this factor should carry no weight, because the only question before the court is whether it should exercise its own jurisdiction and it has no control over foreign proceedings. Of course, ideally the trial should be held at only one of the competing fora, but trial in either forum alone will obviate the risk.

It will be recalled that the Judge came to the view that the factual issues in BVI 83 and Suit 821 are not identical (see above at [32]). The Judge observed that the fact that neither party is seeking any relief in relation to the Share or the 22 units in Newton Imperial in Suit 821 is an indication that the issues in Suit 821 and BVI 83 do not overlap. In addition, in his view, the proceedings do not overlap because the 2014 Agreement is not of key importance to Suit 821 and similarly, the 2003 Agreement is not the focus of BVI 83 (GD at [49] and [62]). While the Judge was correct that the reliefs sought in BVI 83 and Suit 821 are not identical since the Share claimed in BVI 83 is not claimed by either party in Suit 821, we would respectfully disagree with his conclusion that as a result, the issue of whether the 2014 Agreement exists is not before the Singapore court in Suit 821. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 We note at the outset that the Judge was likely influenced in his findings by the manner in which the parties had framed their respective cases before him and the state of events then. As we have alluded to above, the earlier version of the defence filed by the respondent in Suit 821 which was before the Judge contained no <span class="font-italic">express </span>mention of the 2014 Agreement (see [19] above). In addition, in the proceedings below, the appellant’s case was that the 2014 Agreement was not raised in the respondent’s pleadings for Suit 821 and had been raised for the first time by him in the anti-suit injunction proceedings.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 From an examination of the latest version of the pleadings in Suit 821, we are unable to agree with the Judge that the existence and effect of the 2014 Agreement is not an issue before the Singapore court in Suit 821. First, the mere fact that the Share is not specifically claimed by either party in Suit 821 does not mean that the 2014 Agreement is not in issue. As the Judge observed, it would make no sense for Mr Anil to have made a claim in Suit 821 for the ownership of the Share since Mr Anil’s own case was that he was <span class="font-italic">already</span> the legal and beneficial owner of the Share (see GD at [6]). As for the fact that the respondent has not advanced a counterclaim for the Share in Suit 821 and instead commenced proceedings in the BVI, it does not follow that the existence and effect of the 2014 Agreement is not an issue before the Singapore court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 One of the key inquiries in determining the existence of <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span> is whether there are same or similar issues arising from the same factual matrix which are before both courts. We observed in <span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span><span class="font-italic"> Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span>”) (at [47]) that while the nature of the reliefs sought in both set of proceedings is relevant to the analysis, the court ought not to hold that similar issues are brought before both the local and foreign court by focusing merely on the reliefs sought. The converse is also true in that the fact that different reliefs are sought before the local and foreign court does not necessarily mean that the issues that arise for determination by both courts are different. In fact, in cases where the plaintiff sues the defendant in Singapore and the defendant sues the plaintiff abroad (what we termed in <span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span> as a “reversed parties” situation) as opposed to the situation where the same plaintiff sues the same defendant in Singapore and abroad (what we termed in <span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span> as a “common plaintiff” situation), the fact that different reliefs are sought in both jurisdictions is usually not remarkable and certainly not necessarily an indication that both proceedings involve different issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In this case, notwithstanding that the reliefs sought by both parties in the BVI and in Singapore are different, it is clear from a review of the pleadings for Suit 821 and BVI 83 that similar issues arise for determination in both proceedings. In our view, it is clear that the issue of the ownership of the Share is engaged in both proceedings. The pleadings filed by the parties in Suit 821 and BVI 83 discloses only two (alternative) possibilities as to why the Share was transferred by Ms Pooja to Mr Anil in 2014: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On the estate’s case in Suit 821, the Share was transferred in response to a letter of demand sent by Mr Anil’s solicitors to the respondent, for the return of the 22 units which were said to have been transferred by the respondent to the Subsidiaries in breach of trust under the 2003 Agreement. The 2014 share transfer is thus relied on by the estate in Suit 821 as an admission by the respondent of the existence and effect of the 2003 Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On the respondent’s claim in BVI 83 <span class="font-italic">and</span> his defence to Suit 821, the Share was transferred pursuant to the alleged sale and purchase arrangement under the 2014 Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The estate’s claims and the respondent’s claims in both suits are therefore binary in nature. Proof of one party’s case would disprove the other’s. The respondent disputed that this was so, and argued that the 2003 Agreement and 2014 Agreement are not mutually exclusive for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Even if the 2003 Agreement is proved, Mr Anil could still have agreed to pay consideration to the respondent to acquire the 22 units in Newton Imperial, pursuant to the 2014 Agreement. This is because the 2003 Agreement, even if proven, would make Mr Anil the beneficial owner of only the<span class="font-italic"> shares</span> in the SPVs which he claimed were subject to an oral trust. He would not have been the legal or beneficial owner of the 22 units.

If the Singapore court finds that the 2003 Agreement is proved by the estate, it would mean that the estate’s version that the Share was transferred in 2014 by the respondent to return the 22 units would be accepted.

</div>
</div> In the circumstances, it is unclear to us how the respondent could still separately establish that the Share was transferred pursuant to the alleged sale and purchase arrangement in the 2014 Agreement. In other words, since there are only two possibilities for the 2014 share transfer, a rejection of one version would necessarily entail acceptance of the other. In our view, there is simply no middle ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Our view that the 2003 Agreement and 2014 Agreement are mutually exclusive is further buttressed by the appellant’s undertaking to abide by the Singapore court’s decision in the BVI (see above at [33]). Specifically, Mr Singh confirmed during the hearing before us that if the estate fails to prove the 2003 Agreement in Singapore, it would have no defence to the respondent’s claim on the 2014 Agreement and that the Share in MDWL would correspondingly have to be transferred back to Ms Pooja. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Judge erred in finding that the 2014 Agreement is not of key importance in Suit 821 and thus that the issues before the courts in the BVI and in Singapore are different. This was due in part to the arguments which were advanced by the appellant below (see [62]–[63] above). We agree with the Judge, however, that the fact that there are parallel proceedings in the BVI and in Singapore which gives rise to the risk of inconsistent findings, while relevant, is insufficient on its own to justify the grant of the anti-suit injunction (see GD at [61]). The question that remains to be considered is whether there are other factors which point to Singapore being “clearly the more appropriate forum” for the dispute. On an examination of the other relevant connecting factors, we find that Singapore is the natural forum for the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Location of witnesses </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In so far as the location of witnesses is concerned, the Judge was of the view that the fact that several potential witnesses are in Singapore was not material given that (a) the location of witnesses carries little weight where the forum allows for evidence to be taken by video link; and (b) it was not immediately clear how relevant the evidence of the potential witnesses would be to BVI 83 (GD at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 We agree that the availability of information and communication technology such as the possibility of video-link evidence makes the physical location of witnesses less significant since witnesses would not be required to travel to the forum country. However, the more important consideration which the Judge did not appear to have considered is the issue of the compellability of witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The location and the compellability of witnesses as a factor in the determination of the natural forum takes on a greater significance where the main dispute between the parties is largely factual in nature, such as in the present case (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>”)

</div> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [19]). In our judgment, the Judge placed insufficient weight on the fact that while several key witnesses residing in Singapore are clearly compellable to testify or produce documents in the Singapore proceedings, it is unclear if they are likewise compellable in the BVI. This is particularly material since these key witnesses are third-party witnesses over which the appellant has no control (see [74] below). We note in this regard that no evidence was adduced to show that the BVI evidentiary rules permit a foreign witness (residing in Singapore) to be compelled to give evidence in BVI proceedings. The expert evidence on BVI law relied on by the respondent in the proceedings below did not specifically address witness compellability and instead only referred to the taking of evidence via video-link.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>, the party resisting an application to stay Singapore proceedings in favour of Indonesian proceedings submitted, in relation to the issue of witness compellability, that the applicants for the stay had not shown that witnesses resident in Indonesia were compellable in Indonesia. This court found that although it would have been preferable to have had expert evidence on whether witnesses resident in Indonesia could be compelled to testify in an Indonesian court, it was more likely that they would testify there than if the dispute was heard in Singapore since the Singapore court could not compel a foreign witness to testify in Singapore proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [71]–[74]). The situation in the present case is different since it is the compellability of Singapore-resident witnesses in a foreign court which is at issue. However, the same principle applies in that while there is no clear evidence on the compellability of foreign witnesses (in this case, those resident in Singapore) in the BVI proceedings, what is clear is that these witnesses are clearly compellable in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 We also disagree with the Judge’s view that the relevance of potential third-party witnesses who are resident in Singapore is unclear. It appears to us that this view was largely influenced by the Judge’s holding that the 2014 Agreement was not put in issue in Suit 821. The appellant has identified a number of witnesses located in Singapore and has sufficiently explained how their evidence is likely to be material to a determination of the dispute. These include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, witnesses who will give evidence concerning the development of Newton Imperial. This includes the architect and main contractor for the project. Their evidence would be relevant to the question of whether it was Mr Anil or the respondent who funded and spearheaded the construction and development of Newton Imperial. This is likely to be relevant in the court’s consideration of whether the 2003 Agreement exists, and by the same token the non-existence of the 2014 Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, Mr Anil’s Singapore lawyers at the material time from Haridass Ho &amp; Partners who are likely to give evidence relating to alleged assurances made by the respondent in response to the letter of demand sent in 2014 and the escrow agreement for the rental payments.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Appellant’s case at para 61.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The reason for the 2014 share transfer, be it on the respondent’s or the estate’s case, is inextricably linked to both parties’ interest in the 22 units in Newton Imperial that are held by the Subsidiaries. On the respondent’s own case, the 2014 share transfer was purportedly executed to sell the 22 units in Newton Imperial to Mr Anil for a consideration. On the estate’s case, the 2014 share transfer was executed by the respondent to return the 22 units in Newton Imperial to Mr Anil. In addition, there was no suggestion that MDWL and the Subsidiaries had other assets or business activity beyond the 22 units in Newton Imperial. Thus, the real substance of the dispute between the parties is, in truth, the ownership of immovable property and rental proceeds located in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In our view, the fact that the disputed Share is in a BVI-incorporated company is neither critical nor even material. Although the respondent seeks in BVI 83 for an order that he be entered as the sole registered shareholder in MDWL’s register of members and a declaration that he is the sole beneficial owner of the Share, these reliefs are sought not as an end in themselves but as means to an end. The Share is of interest to the parties because of the assets held by MDWL through its Subsidiaries, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 22 units in Newton Imperial which are located in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The respondent sought to rely on the decision of the Judge in applications related to Suit 821 for the removal of caveats. In brief, shortly prior to commencing Suit 821, Mr Anil had lodged caveats against several properties registered in the names of the respondent and his wife or in companies that the respondent controlled. The registered proprietors commenced proceedings by way of Originating Summonses Nos 727 and 945 of 2015 (“OS 727” and “OS 945”) to remove the caveats. The Judge’s decision on the caveat removal applications is reported at <span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span><span class="font-italic"> Darsan Jitendra and others v Salgaocar Anil Vassudeva and others</span> [2018] 5 SLR 689 (“<span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span><span class="font-italic"> Darsan Jitendra</span>”). In summary, the Judge allowed the caveats to be lifted, finding that Mr Anil did not have a caveatable interest in the properties since his claim in Suit 821 is premised on his beneficial interest in the <span class="font-italic">shares</span> in the relevant SPVs which the respondent allegedly held on trust for him. It was not his case that the 2003 Agreement provided for the SPVs’ <span class="font-italic">assets</span> to be held on trust for him (<span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span><span class="font-italic"> Darsan Jitendra</span> at [31]). In addition, the principle of separate legal personality implied that even if one owned the shares in a company, one did not own its assets (<span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span><span class="font-italic"> Darsan Jitendra</span> at [34]). On appeal, we affirmed the Judge’s decision to lift the caveats.

</div> On this basis, the respondent submitted that this court has acknowledged that the estate’s claim in Suit 821 does not extend to a proprietary interest in the assets of the SPVs. He argues that for similar reasons, it would be inaccurate to say that the substance of the dispute in BVI 83 is over the ownership of the 22 units in Newton Imperial and not the Share.

The issue considered by the Judge and by this court (on appeal) in OS 727 and OS 945 was whether Mr Anil had a <span class="font-italic">caveatable</span><span class="font-italic"> interest</span> in the properties by virtue of his claims in Suit 821. It is understandable that in that context, the specific nature of the relief claimed was of central importance.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, given that this factor assumes that the respondent’s claim is made out, we are of the view that limited weight should be placed on it. In addition, as the nub of the respondent’s claim is that the Share was transferred without Mr Anil having paid the agreed consideration under the 2014 Agreement, it could equally be argued that the “place of performance/breach” is the place where payment is due and not the location where the Share is registered. In our judgment, on the facts of the present case, the place of performance/breach does not point to any one jurisdiction being the clearly more appropriate forum for the dispute and is therefore of limited relevance in identifying the natural forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In addition, that the <span class="font-italic">place of enforcement</span><span class="font-italic"> of judgment</span> is the BVI (since the relief sought by the respondent is an order that he be entered as the sole registered shareholder in MDWL’s register of members) is unlikely to have any material significance given (a) the purpose of the alleged 2014 Agreement was to sell 22 units in Newton Imperial located in Singapore; and (b) the appellant’s undertaking that she will, in any event, abide by the decision of the Singapore courts in the BVI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Finally, we should add that the place of contracting is also not material as it is the respondent’s case that the 2014 Agreement was concluded orally over the telephone while he was in Hong Kong and Mr Anil in India. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Vexatious or oppressive conduct </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Judge was of the view that the appellant had failed to establish that the respondent had commenced BVI 83 in bad faith because, amongst others, Suit 821 had not reached an advanced stage at the time BVI 83 was commenced, and the factual issues in BVI 83 and Suit 821 were in any event not identical (GD at [60] and [62]). Having considered the nature of the claims brought by the respondent in BVI 83 and the circumstances in which the proceedings in the BVI were commenced, we are unable to agree with the Judge that the respondent has not acted in a vexatious or oppressive manner in pursuing BVI 83. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Timing of the commencement of BVI 83</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The timing of the commencement of BVI 83 suggests that it was brought by the respondent in bad faith. There are, in our judgment, two aspects in relation to the timing of the commencement of BVI 83 which are particularly significant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 First, there was a significant gap between the time when the respondent’s cause of action accrued and the time BVI 83 was commenced. The respondent’s main claim in BVI 83 is that Mr Anil failed to pay what was due to him under the 2014 Agreement as consideration for the transfer of the Share. However, it is undisputed that the Share was transferred by Ms Pooja to Mr Anil in July 2014. Yet, BVI 83 was only commenced in May 2017, almost three years after the transfer of the Share and 20 months after Suit 821 was commenced. This delay is particularly glaring given the amount at stake (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, more than US$41m). No reasonable explanation was provided by the respondent to account for the delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 At the hearing before us, Mr Landau, in seeking to proffer an explanation for the delay in the commencement of BVI 83, referred to the fact that at the time BVI 83 was commenced, the progress of Suit 821 had been stalled for quite some time. However, on the respondent’s own case, the claims under Suit 821 and BVI 83 are independent of each other and thus the status of Suit 821 should not affect the timing of the respondent’s commencement of BVI 83. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Second, BVI 83 was commenced at a time when the estate was almost ready to take over the conduct of Suit 821. It will be recalled that following Mr Anil’s death, the progress in Suit 821 was stalled due to the dispute over the rightful administratrix to represent his estate. As mentioned above, (see [21]), the respondent’s lawyers were copied on a letter dated 15 May 2017 sent by the appellant’s solicitors to the court stating that the issue of representation for the purposes of Suit 821 was “on the brink of a settlement”. It was no coincidence that BVI 83 was commenced <span class="font-italic">one day</span> <span class="font-italic">after</span> this letter was copied to the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Thus, the fact that the Share was transferred to Mr Anil in 2014 but the respondent only commenced BVI 83 on 16 May 2017, one day after he was informed of the likely progress of the proceedings in Suit 821, suggests that the respondent had commenced the proceedings in the BVI in bad faith. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Failure to advance counterclaim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the light of the manner in which the parties’ respective pleadings have been framed, we find that the issues raised in BVI 83 do overlap with those raised in Suit 821. The respondent could and should have advanced a counterclaim for the legal and beneficial interest in the Share in Suit 821 but had not done so and instead commenced proceedings in BVI 83 for tactical reasons. In this regard, we note that the respondent had in fact attempted to amend his pleadings to Suit 821 to introduce a counterclaim (which was rejected by the Judge as it did not disclose a cause of action and/or was time barred), but conspicuously omitted to mount any claim for the Share in his abortive counterclaim.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Given the overlap in the facts and issues in BVI 83 and Suit 821, there was no legitimate reason for the respondent to have commenced BVI 83 instead of filing a counterclaim in Suit 821. As the Judge found, the respondent had not identified any legitimate juridical advantages associated with proceeding in the BVI. Further, since the appellant has indicated that she is prepared to undertake, should the anti-suit injunction be granted, to consent to judgment in the BVI on terms that are identical to the terms of any Singapore judgment that the respondent might obtain, there can be no legitimate reason for the respondent’s preference to have his claim over the Share heard in the BVI rather than to advance a counterclaim here (see [33] above).

In the circumstances, we see no reason why the respondent should be allowed to continue pursuing the BVI proceedings in tandem with the Singapore proceedings. The existence of parallel proceedings on the same matter in two jurisdictions inevitably gives rise to a risk of inconsistent judgments. It also unnecessarily entails the incurring of additional costs, time, and effort for both parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Mr Landau’s only response was that the respondent has the right to seek legal recourse in the judicial system of his choice.

</div> That may well be so but given the specific factual matrix in the present case, we find that the respondent’s exercise of that right was made in bad faith, in order to duplicate the proceedings to vex and oppress the estate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: The significance of the BVI decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For the foregoing reasons, we find that the requirements for an anti-suit injunction that Singapore is the clearly more appropriate forum and that the pursuit of foreign proceedings is vexatious or oppressive have been established. At the hearing before us, Mr Landau argued that even if Singapore is determined to be the natural forum for the respondent’s claim and the pursuit of BVI 83 is found to be vexatious or oppressive, this court is nevertheless precluded from granting the anti-suit injunction by principles of comity and the doctrine of issue estoppel in the light of the intervening decision of the BVI court not to stay its proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 We disagree with the respondent’s submission that where the foreign court has declined to stay its proceedings, an issue estoppel operates to preclude the court hearing the anti-suit injunction application from considering the merits of the application.

</div>
</div> In that case, the plaintiff bank commenced proceedings in Arizona against a limited partnership and its partners for the amount due under a promissory note. By the time the proceedings were commenced, the defendant partner had already left the US and moved to England. The preliminary question before the Arizona court, which it answered in the affirmative, was whether the defendant had voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arizona court given that a US attorney purportedly acting for him had entered an appearance on his behalf. The plaintiff eventually obtained judgment against the defendant before the Arizona courts, which it sought to enforce against the defendant in England. Before the English courts, one of the questions that arose was whether the defendant was estopped from arguing that the Arizona court did not have jurisdiction to render the judgment because the US attorney was not authorised. The English Court of Appeal held that an issue estoppel could arise from interlocutory judgments of a foreign court provided certain requirements were met (at 858h–858j). On the facts of that case however, it found that the judgment of the Arizona court did not give rise to an issue estoppel as it was not sufficiently clear from that judgment if the issue relating to the authority of the US attorney to act on his behalf had been specifically identified and decided against the defendant in the Arizona court (at 860g–860h). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 We accept that issue estoppel can in principle arise in respect of foreign decisions on interlocutory matters. In our judgment, however, the case is not helpful to the respondent. In <span class="font-italic">Desert Sun</span>, the relevant issue before the English Court of Appeal was whether a decision of the Arizona courts to assume jurisdiction over the defendant could give rise to an issue estoppel on the specific question of jurisdiction of the Arizona courts in enforcement proceedings in England. There was thus arguably identity in the subject matter of both proceedings (though the court went on to find that it was unclear that the factual issue before the English court had in fact been decided by the Arizona court). It was in that context that the English Court of Appeal expressed its view that an issue estoppel could arise from a foreign judgment on an interlocutory issue, if the relevant conditions are met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Before us, Mr Landau was unable to point us to any authorities for the more precise position which he was advancing in the present appeal, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that a stay decision by a court of one jurisdiction can give rise to an issue estoppel in respect of a subsequent anti-suit injunction application in the competing forum. We note that the case law shows that it is in fact not uncommon for an anti-suit injunction application to be brought by one party after its bid to stay the foreign proceedings has failed. In our view, it is no coincidence that in none of the cases was the matter disposed of by way of the doctrine of issue estoppel. This will become apparent when we examine the issue of comity in the next section of this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 More importantly, we are of the view that the doctrine of issue estoppel cannot apply in the manner suggested by the respondent because it would lead to arbitrary outcomes. If issue estoppel applies in the manner advanced by the respondent, the court that is second in time would effectively always be precluded from considering the application before it, though the application is strictly speaking different from that which was considered by the foreign court. This cannot be legally correct and is not supported by the case law. To suggest otherwise would effectively mean that the outcome of any such applications would be dependent on the scheduling of the hearings by the courts over which the parties would have no control whatsoever.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 At the hearing before us, Mr Landau sought to clarify that his argument on issue estoppel was not that this court could no longer grant the anti-suit injunction given the decision of the BVI court to assume jurisdiction, but that the appellant could no longer re-litigate the specific issue of the natural forum since this issue was raised before and decided by the BVI court in the stay application. While this distinction may appear relevant at first blush, we find that ultimately, the distinction drawn is artificial. Whether the reliance on issue estoppel is to preclude the granting of the anti-suit injunction, or that the doctrine has the effect of preventing the applicant of the anti-suit injunction from re-litigating the specific issue of natural forum, the practical effect of accepting either argument is the same. On either argument, where the foreign court has declined to stay its proceedings on <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> grounds, the subsequent court considering the anti-suit injunction application must necessarily decline to issue the injunction because of the prior decision of the foreign court (including the foreign court’s findings on the natural forum for the dispute). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the fact that a foreign court has declined to stay its proceedings does not give rise to an issue estoppel which precludes the losing party in the stay application from bringing an anti-suit injunction application before the Singapore courts and from advancing arguments on the natural forum in that subsequent application. It may, however, have a bearing on consideration of comity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Comity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The final issue raised in this appeal is whether consideration of comity prevents this court from allowing the appeal and granting the anti-suit injunction in the light of the intervening decision of the BVI court not to stay its proceedings, which was rendered while the present appeal was pending. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In our judgment, where the foreign court has declined to stay its proceedings, comity principles do not generally preclude the domestic court from granting the injunction if it finds that (a) it is clearly the more appropriate forum for the dispute; <span class="font-italic">and</span> (b) the defendant in the application has acted in a vexatious or oppressive manner in commencing the foreign proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It has long been recognised that since an anti-suit injunction indirectly affects the foreign court, the jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution and considerations of comity do weigh into the court’s determination of whether the injunction should be granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In fact, comity is said to be the reason for the distinction in the legal requirements between an anti-suit injunction and a stay.

Lord Goff explained that where an anti-suit injunction application is brought before the English courts, the injunction cannot be granted on the sole ground that England is the natural forum for the dispute. This is because such an approach suggested that an anti-suit injunction could be granted simply when the English court differed from the foreign court in its view on the natural forum for the dispute, which would be inconsistent with comity. Thus in <span class="font-italic">Aerospatiale, </span>it was held that an anti-suit injunction would only be granted where England is the natural forum for the dispute <span class="font-italic">and</span> the pursuit of foreign proceedings is vexatious or oppressive (at 895–896).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 While the relevance of comity is undisputed, the precise scope of the principle is less clear.

</div>
</div> Lord Goff highlighted that two different approaches may be discerned from the case law as to the circumstances in which an anti-suit injunction may be granted (at 136G–137B). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Under the first approach known as the “stricter” approach, comity requires that an anti-suit injunction be granted only in exceptional circumstances for example (a) to protect its own jurisdiction; or (b) to prevent evasion of the forum’s public policies (see <span class="font-italic">Airbus </span><span class="font-italic">Industrie </span>at 136H). Under the second approach, which Lord Goff termed the “laxer standard” and which we shall refer to as “the conventional approach”, an anti-suit injunction may be granted as long as the pursuit of foreign proceedings is vexatious or oppressive or would otherwise cause inequitable hardship. While the effect of the injunction on the foreign court will be a factor relevant in considering whether the injunction should be granted, the court will require evidence that comity is likely to be impaired (<span class="font-italic">Airbus </span><span class="font-italic">Industrie</span> at 137A–137B). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The relevant facts in <span class="font-italic">Airbus </span><span class="font-italic">Industrie</span> were as follows. The plaintiffs in the main action who were residents of England had commenced proceedings in Texas against the manufacturers of an aircraft in relation to an air crash which took place at Bangalore airport. The defendants sought to restrain the plaintiffs from proceeding in Texas on the basis that the natural forum for the suit was India. As the courts of India could not grant effective injunctive relief against the plaintiffs because the plaintiffs were not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Indian courts, the defendants brought an anti-suit injunction application in the English courts. The House of Lords declined to issue the anti-suit injunction on the basis that it did not have a sufficient interest in or connection with the dispute in question and that the grant of the injunction would thus be inconsistent with comity. Lord Goff set out the following general principle (at 138G): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As a general rule, before an anti-suit injunction can properly be granted by an English court to restrain a person from pursuing proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">in cases of the kind under consideration</span> in the present case, comity requires that the English forum should have a sufficient interest in, or connection with, the matter in question to justify the indirect interference with the foreign court which an anti-suit injunction entails. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Lord Goff expressed the view that this general principle was closer to the stricter approach but at the same time maintained the overarching consideration that an injunction can be granted where the ends of justice require (at 139H–140B). Thus, Lord Goff suggested that the requirement for the domestic court to have a sufficient interest in or connection with the dispute was an approach which balanced the principles recognised under both the stricter and conventional approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 From a review of the relevant legal authorities, we find that most cases, like <span class="font-italic">Airbus</span><span class="font-italic"> Industrie</span>, in fact adopt an approach that falls in between the stricter approach and conventional approach as described by Lord Goff. In particular, the cases suggest that the grant of an anti-suit injunction is not merely confined to situations where there is a need for the domestic court to protect its own jurisdiction or prevent evasion of public policies (pursuant to the stricter approach). At the same time, it is recognised that an anti-suit injunction cannot always be granted so long as the pursuit of foreign proceedings is vexatious or oppressive (pursuant to the conventional approach). Specifically, there is a common recognition in the case law that where the domestic court has a sufficiently close connection with the dispute (such as where it is the natural forum) and the pursuit of the foreign proceedings is found to be unconscionable, the grant of the injunction is less likely to infringe principles of comity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 We turn first to examine the two anti-suit injunction decisions which were issued by the English courts in relation to the Laker Airways litigation to illustrate how comity considerations can be treated differently under different factual matrices notwithstanding similarities in the genesis of the proceedings. The cases arose out of an anti-trust suit commenced by Laker Airways in the US against the British Airways Board and British Caledonian Airways. The liquidator of Laker Airways alleged a conspiracy among major airlines to force Laker Airways out of the market for transatlantic flights by predatory pricing. In the first case, <span class="font-italic">British Airways Board v Laker Airways Ltd</span> [1985] AC 58 (“<span class="font-italic">British Airways Board</span>”), the House of Lords held that British Airways and British Caledonian Airways were not entitled to an injunction as the British airline companies failed to show that Laker Airways had acted unconscionably in instituting proceedings in the US. This is because the two airlines had, in obtaining an air transport licence to operate on routes between the UK and the US, voluntarily submitted themselves to a regulatory regime which subjected them to US antitrust laws (at 84). On the other hand, in the second case, <span class="font-italic">Midland </span><span class="font-italic">Bank plc v Laker Airways Ltd</span> [1986] QB 689 (“<span class="font-italic">Midland Bank</span>”),

</div>
</div> the English Court of Appeal granted an English bank an anti-suit injunction to restrain Laker Airways from proceeding against it in the US. As the bank had no presence in the US and its connection to Laker Airways arose out of banking transactions in England which were governed by English law, the proceedings brought against the bank in the US were found to be unconscionable (at 699–700). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Although the principle of comity was not specifically discussed in both cases, Lord Goff expressed the view in <span class="font-italic">Airbus </span><span class="font-italic">Industrie</span> that the English court’s decision to grant the injunction in <span class="font-italic">Midland Bank</span> and not in <span class="font-italic">British Airways Board</span> could be said to be consistent with principles of comity (at 138): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At all events it is striking that, in <span class="font-italic">Midland Bank Plc v Laker Airways Ltd</span>, the injunction was granted in circumstances where the relevant transaction was overwhelmingly English in character. It can therefore be said that, on this basis, the decision was consistent with comity, though the point was not articulated in the judgments because it did not arise for consideration; and, by parity of reasoning, it can be said that the grant of an injunction at the suit of British Airways and British Caledonian to restrain Laker from proceeding against them in the United States could not be justified in this way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Similarly, as we have earlier mentioned (see [109] above), in <span class="font-italic">Aerospatiale</span> the Privy Council held that in order not to violate the principles of comity, an anti-suit injunction would only be granted where the court considering the anti-suit injunction application is the natural forum for the dispute <span class="font-italic">and</span> the pursuit of foreign proceedings is vexatious or oppressive. On the facts, the Privy Council found that Brunei was the natural forum for the dispute and that it would be oppressive for the plaintiffs to continue the Texas proceedings because of the serious injustice to the defendant in not being able to claim in those proceedings indemnity or contribution from a third party (at 902E–902G). Thus although the Texas courts had declined to stay its proceedings, the Privy Council granted the anti-suit injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The <span class="font-italic">Airbus </span><span class="font-italic">Industrie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Aerospatiale </span>and Laker Airways<span class="font-italic"> </span>cases suggest that where the court before which the application for an anti-suit injunction is brought has a sufficient connection to the dispute and the defendant in the application has acted in a vexatious or oppressive manner in commencing the foreign proceeding, the grant of the anti-suit injunction would not, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, violate principles of comity because of the interrelations between the three factors. We find the following extract from <span class="font-italic">The Anti-Suit Injunction</span> (Thomas Raphael, Oxford University Press, 2008) (“<span class="font-italic">The Anti-Suit Injunction</span>”) to be useful in explaining the connections between the legal requirements for an anti-suit injunction (at para 4.31):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The modern purpose of the concepts of vexation and oppression is to set a high threshold for the grant of an anti-suit injunction, and to discourage the court from granting the potentially exorbitant remedy of an injunction whenever it might seem at first sight ‘just and convenient’ to do so. From this perspective, the criteria of vexation or oppression are part of the defences of comity. Vexation and comity are connected, albeit distinct; thus comity requires that an injunction will not in general be granted in alternative forum cases unless England is the natural forum for the injunction; but equally, the foreign litigation is unlikely to be vexatious unless the foreign forum is a less natural forum than England. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 At the hearing before us, Mr Landau referred us to a number of cases for the proposition that it is generally for the court in which proceedings are brought to determine whether it is the natural forum for the dispute, and that it would be a breach of comity for another court to arrogate determination of that question to itself where that first court has already determined that it is the natural forum. On this basis, he submitted that where a foreign court has declined to stay its proceedings, the local court should not grant an anti-suit injunction save in the most exceptional of circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 First, in <span class="font-italic">Amchem</span><span class="font-italic"> Products Inc v British Columbia (Workers’ Compensation Board)</span> [1993] 1 RCS 897 (“<span class="font-italic">Amchem</span>”),

</div> proceedings were brought in respect of a company incorporated in England, Maxwell Communications Corp plc (“MCC”), which was in administration in London and faced bankruptcy proceedings in the US. MCC’s principal assets were in the US. Barclays Bank was a creditor which received a repayment of US$30m shortly before MCC went into administration in London and the bankruptcy proceedings in the US were commenced. It sought an injunction before the English courts to prevent the administrators from challenging the payment as a preference in the US courts, on the ground that the proper forum for dealing with the matter was the UK. Hoffmann J, in declining to issue the anti-suit injunction, explained that “both comity and common sense suggest that the foreign judge is usually the best person to decide whether in his own court he should accept or decline jurisdiction, stay proceedings or allow them to continue” and thus “there must be a good reason why the decision to stop the foreign proceedings should be made [in the domestic court] rather than [the foreign court]” (at 687). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The third case which Mr Landau relied on was the case of <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Bank AG</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Highland Crusader Offshore Partners LP and others </span>[2010] 1 WLR 1023 (“<span class="font-italic">Deutsche Bank”</span>).

</div> In that case, the plaintiff in the anti-suit injunction application (“Deutsche Bank”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>was a German bank with its principal place of business in Germany and an office in London. The first to third defendants (“Highland”) were a group of companies operating as a major US hedge fund. The dispute between the parties concerned repurchase contracts which provided for English governing law and the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. Highland filed proceedings against Deutsche Bank in Texas alleging that Deutsche Bank induced Highland to buy a portfolio of securities by fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation. Shortly thereafter, Deutsche Bank sued Highland in London claiming sums which were due under the contracts. Deutsche Bank’s application for a stay was rejected by the Texas courts. It then applied for an anti-suit injunction before the English courts to restrain Highland from continuing the Texas proceedings. In dismissing the application for the anti-suit injunction, the English Court of Appeal set out the general principles applicable in such applications (at [50]). Mr Landau relied on principles four and five: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) If the English court considers England to be the natural forum and can see no legitimate personal or juridical advantage in the claimant in the foreign proceedings being allowed to pursue them, it does not automatically follow that an anti-suit injunction should be granted. For that would be to overlook the important restraining influence of considerations of comity. (5) An anti-suit injunction always requires caution because by definition it involves interference with the process or potential process of a foreign court. … [T]he principle of comity requires the court to recognise that, in deciding questions of weight to be attached to different factors, different judges operating under different legal systems with different legal policies may legitimately arrive at different answers, without occasioning a breach of customary international law or manifest injustice, and that in such circumstances it is not for an English court to arrogate to itself the decision how a foreign court should determine the matter. The stronger the connection of the foreign court with the parties and the subject matter of the dispute, the stronger the argument against intervention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 While we agree with the principle that it is generally for the court in which proceedings are brought to determine whether it is the natural forum for the dispute, we are of the view that this principle does not apply with equal force where a defendant has deliberately carved out a specific issue from a pending suit and commenced proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction in respect of this issue. In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the foreign court is necessarily in a better position to determine if it is the natural forum for the dispute, having regard to the overall dispute between the parties. We note that this is a point which was recognised in <span class="font-italic">Barclays Bank</span>. In that case, the Court of Appeal affirmed Hoffmann J’s decision but framed the relevant principles somewhat differently from Hoffmann J as follows (at 701, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Glidewell LJ):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) If the only issue is whether an English or a foreign court is the more appropriate forum for the trial of an action, that question should normally be decided by the foreign court on the principle of forum non conveniens, and the English court should not seek to interfere with that decision. (ii) However if, exceptionally, the English court concludes that the pursuit of the action in the foreign court would be vexatious and oppressive and that the English court is the natural forum, ie the more appropriate forum for the trial of the action, it can properly grant an injunction preventing the plaintiff from pursuing his action in the foreign court. (iii) In deciding whether the action in the foreign court is vexatious and oppressive, account must be taken of the possible injustice to the defendant if the injunction be not granted, and the possible injustice to the plaintiff if it is. In other words, the English court must seek to strike a balance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Significantly, Glidewell LJ also suggested that the principle stated by Hoffmann J that it is the foreign judge who is usually the best person to decide whether to accept jurisdiction in his court <span class="font-italic">only</span> <span class="font-italic">applies</span> in circumstances where the foreign proceedings are <span class="font-italic">not vexatious </span><span class="font-italic">or oppressive</span> (at 703):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Merriman for Barclays Bank argues that in his judgment Hoffmann J was at fault in the following respects. (I) In the passages I have quoted, the learned judge said that the ‘normal assumption’ was that it was for the foreign judge to decide whether to accept jurisdiction in his court rather than for an English judge to decide that he should not. <span class="font-italic">But when Hoffmann</span><span class="font-italic"> J said this, he had already made it clear that in an exceptional case where the foreign proceedings were vexatious or oppressive, an injunction could properly be granted.</span> Thus his reference to the normal assumption can only be read as a reference to the principle to which I have already referred, ie that <span class="font-italic">where the foreign proceedings are not vexatious </span><span class="font-italic">or oppressive</span>, it is prima facie<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the foreign court to decide whether or not it is the appropriate forum for the decision of the suit before it. In this respect, I agree with Hoffmann J. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We agree with the observations of Glidewell LJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In addition, we note that the refusal of the anti-suit injunction in the <span class="font-italic">Amchem</span>, <span class="font-italic">Barclays B</span><span class="font-italic">ank</span> and <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Bank</span> cases can be explained by the fact that the respective courts in those cases found that they were not the clearly more appropriate forum for the dispute. Thus, the pursuit of the foreign proceedings was not deemed to be vexatious or oppressive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In <span class="font-italic">Amchem</span>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the trial judge should not have granted the injunction given that both the US and British Columbia could equally be said to be the natural forum and neither was a clearly more appropriate forum than the other (at 935). In this regard, it also found that the Texas court’s decision not to stay its proceedings could be said to have been reasonably concluded given that all of the asbestos companies had some connection with Texas (and no connections to British Columbia) and the acts which were the foundation of the claim also took place outside of Canada, in the US (at 935). Further, the court found that the continuation of the Texas proceedings would not deprive the defendant of legitimate juridical advantages in British Columbia (at 936).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126  Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Barclays Bank</span>, the English Court of Appeal agreed with Hoffmann J that the presence of substantial creditors, assets and funds derived from assets in the US, coupled with the absence of any challenge to the US bankruptcy proceedings, sufficed to explain the assumption of jurisdiction by the US court and militate against the conduct being regarded as unconscionable according to English notions (at 705–706). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 As for <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Bank</span>, the English Court of Appeal found that the decision by the Texas court to assume jurisdiction was reasonable because Highland had strong connections with Texas and their complaints related to financial agreements negotiated and executed by them in Texas (at [119]). The dispute between the parties arose under a standard form contract governed by English law and with an English non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, but “there [was] relatively little else to connect the dispute with England (at [120]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Thus, while we acknowledge that the cases relied on by Mr Landau do appear to lean closer towards the stricter approach outlined by Lord Goff in <span class="font-italic">Airbus </span><span class="font-italic">Industrie</span>, they do not go so far as to advance the proposition put forward by the respondent in the present appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Therefore, we hold that even where the foreign court has declined to stay its proceedings, it would not invariably be a breach of comity for the domestic court to grant an anti-suit injunction if it finds that (a) it is clearly the more appropriate forum for the dispute; <span class="font-italic">and</span> (b) the defendant in the application has acted in a vexatious or oppressive manner in commencing the foreign proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Finally, we note that this approach is consistent with that adopted in a number of local decisions.

The wife filed a writ of divorce and sought ancillary relief in Singapore. Subsequently, the husband commenced proceedings in New York for an order that the wife be restrained from alleged breaches of the terms of the prenuptial agreement. Choo Han Teck J found that the US proceedings were vexatious and oppressive and that an anti-suit injunction should be granted to meet the ends of justice.

Not only would such delays entail a significant wastage of judicial time and costs, an injunction would have the effect of precluding other foreign courts of their prerogative to recognise the judgment in question and might even interfere with the execution of the judgment in the country of the court which pronounced the judgment and where the judgment can be expected to be obeyed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application to present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In the light of our findings that Singapore is the natural forum for the dispute and that the respondent has acted in a vexatious and oppressive manner in pursuing BVI 83, the grant of the anti-suit injunction would not breach comity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 On the facts of the present case, there are also additional reasons why the principle of comity should not operate in the manner advanced by the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 First, as a matter of principle, we are of the view that an intervening decision by a foreign court not to stay its proceedings which is rendered while an appeal against a lower court’s refusal to grant the anti-suit injunction is pending, should not on its own change the outcome of the appeal.

</em>Civil Appeal No 18 of 2018</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Steven Chong JA):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: red; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>Court of Appeal grants anti-suit injunction based on findings that Singapore is the natural forum for the dispute and pursuit of BVI proceedings by the respondent is vexatious and oppressive </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Background to the appeal</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1          The appellant, Mdm Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar, applied for an anti-suit injunction to restrain the respondent, Mr Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra, from continuing proceedings which he had commenced in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) (“BVI 83”) while another suit was pending in Singapore between the parties. The appellant is the administratrix of the estate of her late husband, Mr Anil Vassudeva Salgaocar (“Mr Anil”). The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) declined to issue the anti-suit injunction. The appellant appealed against the Judge’s decision. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and granted the anti-suit injunction. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><strong>The material facts </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2          For the purposes of the anti-suit injunction, the material dispute between the parties concerned the ownership of a single share in a BVI-incorporated company, Million Dragon Wealth Ltd (“MDWL”) (“the Share”). MDWL was in turn the sole shareholder of 22 other BVI-incorporated companies (“the Subsidiaries”). Each of the Subsidiaries owned one unit in a condominium development in Singapore known as Newton Imperial. The units were rented out, and the rental income was collected in Singapore by a Singapore law firm. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3          Prior to July 2014, the Share was registered in the name of the respondent’s daughter, Ms Pooja Darsan Jhaveri (“Ms Pooja”), who held the Share as the respondent’s nominee. On 8 July 2014, Ms Pooja executed a memorandum transferring the Share to Mr Anil for the nominal sum of US$1 (“the 2014 share transfer”). The reason for the 2014 share transfer was disputed between the parties. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4          In August 2015, Mr Anil commenced Suit No 821 of 2015 (“Suit 821”) in Singapore against the respondent, for a declaration that the respondent held various assets on trust for him, an order for the return of the trust assets, and an account and inquiry of all traceable proceeds of the assets. Specifically, Mr Anil claimed that he had entered into an oral agreement with the respondent in 2003 (“the 2003 Agreement”), under which it was agreed that he would use his funds to set up Special Purpose Vehicles (“SPVs”) to conduct business and hold assets, and that the respondent would be a shareholder and/or director of the SPVs and would hold the shares of the SPVs on trust for Mr Anil. Mr Anil claimed that pursuant to this agreement, he had set up Great Newton Properties Pte Ltd (“Great Newton Properties”) which was the developer of Newton Imperial. It was further claimed that the respondent committed various breaches of trust, by amongst others, causing Great Newton Properties to transfer 22 units in Newton Imperial to the Subsidiaries. Mr Anil’s case is that the Share was transferred in 2014 by Ms Pooja in response to a letter of demand sent by his solicitors to the respondent, for the return of the 22 units. The 2014 share transfer was thus relied on by Mr Anil in Suit 821 as an admission by the respondent of the existence and effect of the 2003 Agreement. In response, the respondent denied the existence of the 2003 Agreement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">5          Following Mr Anil’s passing in 2016, there was a </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">temporary halt in the progress of Suit 821 due to a dispute </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">between the appellant and Mr Anil’s daughter, Ms Chandana Anil Salgaocar (“Ms Chandana”), over the appointment of </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">the administratrix of the estate. On 15 May 2017, the respondent was informed by the appellant that the dispute </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">over the appointment of </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">the administratrix of the estate was on the brink of settlement and that with the settlement, the estate would be ready to take over the conduct of Suit 821. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">6          One day later on 16 May 2017, </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">the respondent commenced BVI 83 against the estate and MDWL in the BVI. In BVI 83, the respondent claimed that he was the rightful owner of the Share. He claimed that in 2014, he entered into a different oral agreement with Mr Anil in which Mr Anil agreed to purchase the Share from him for a sum of money (“the 2014 Agreement”). This was essentially to allow Mr Anil to purchase the 22 units in Newton Imperial from the respondent in a tax efficient manner. It is claimed that although the Share was transferred by Ms Pooja to Mr Anil, Mr Anil passed away before paying the respondent what was due under the 2014 Agreement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">7          Approximately one month after BVI 83 was commenced by the respondent, the appellant filed Originating Summons No 627 of 2017 in the Singapore High Court for an anti-suit injunction to restrain the respondent from proceeding in BVI 83. The Judge dismissed the application for the anti-suit injunction. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">8          After the Judge rendered his decision and while the present appeal was pending, the appellant filed an application in the BVI, asking the BVI court to stay its proceedings on <em>forum non conveniens</em> grounds. The BVI court found that it was the natural forum for the dispute under BVI 83 and declined to stay its proceedings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><strong>The Court of Appeal's decision</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">9          The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and granted the injunction. It found that the legal requirements for an anti-suit injunction to be granted, <em>ie</em>, that (a) Singapore is the natural forum for the dispute; and (b) that the pursuit of foreign proceedings is vexatious and oppressive, were satisfied. It also held that the doctrine of issue estoppel did not apply to preclude the grant of the injunction, and that the grant of the injunction did not breach comity notwithstanding the BVI court’s decision not to stay its proceedings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><strong><em>Whether Singapore was the natural forum for the dispute</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">10        The Court of Appeal reiterated that in identifying the natural forum for the dispute, greater weight should be ascribed to the connecting factors likely to be material to a fair determination of the dispute (at <strong>[54]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">11        It found that Singapore was the natural forum for the dispute based on the following connecting factors: </span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The existence of parallel proceedings in Singapore: </span></em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">From a review of the latest versions of the pleadings for Suit 821 and BVI 83, it was clear that similar issues arose for determination in both proceedings. The estate’s claims and the respondent’s claims in both suits were binary in nature (at <strong>[67]</strong>). This was evident from the latest version of the pleadings filed by the parties in Suit 821 and BVI 83 which disclosed only two (alternative) possibilities as to why the Share was transferred by Ms Pooja to Mr Anil in 2014 (at <strong>[66]</strong>): </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">On the estate’s case in Suit 821, the Share was transferred in response to a letter of demand sent by Mr Anil’s solicitors to the respondent, for the return of the 22 units which were said to have been transferred by the respondent to the Subsidiaries in breach of trust under the 2003 Agreement. The 2014 share transfer was thus relied on by the estate in Suit 821 as an admission by the respondent of the existence and effect of the 2003 Agreement.</span></p>
</li>
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The fact that several witnesses were located in Singapore and therefore compellable in Singapore</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">: The appellant had sufficiently demonstrated that the evidence of the witnesses in Singapore was “at least arguably relevant”. In stark contrast, the respondent had not identified any witness located in the BVI whose testimony would be of any relevance to the issues in BVI 83 (at <strong>[76]</strong>).</span></p>
</li>
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The fact that the real substance of the dispute between the parties concerned the ownership of immovable property and rental proceeds located in Singapore</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">: The Share was of consequence and of interest to the parties only because of the 22 units in Newton Imperial. In this regard, the fact that the disputed Share was in a BVI-incorporated company was not material (at <strong>[80]</strong>, <strong>[81]</strong>).</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">12        Based on the facts of the case, the governing law of the dispute was of limited utility and relevance. There was no suggestion by either party that the BVI or Singapore court would apply different principles that would affect the outcome of the dispute, particularly since both Singapore and the BVI were common law jurisdictions. In addition, the key issues in dispute between the parties were factual and not legal in nature (at <strong>[55]</strong>). On the facts of the case, other factors including the residence of the parties, place of performance/breach, place of enforcement of judgment, and place of contracting were of limited relevance as well (at <strong>[77]</strong>, <strong>[85]</strong>, <strong>[86]</strong>, <strong>[87]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">13        The Court of Appeal found that the pursuit of BVI 83 by the respondent was vexatious and oppressive for the following reasons: </span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The timing of the commencement of BVI 83 by the respondent:</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> The fact that the Share was transferred to Mr Anil in 2014 but the respondent only commenced BVI 83 on 16 May 2017, one day after he was informed of the likely progress of the proceedings in Suit 821, suggested that the respondent had commenced the proceedings in the BVI in bad faith (at <strong>[93]</strong>).</span></p>
</li>
<li style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The respondent’s failure to advance a counterclaim</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">: Given the overlap in the facts and issues in BVI 83 and Suit 821, there was no legitimate reason for the respondent to have commenced BVI 83 instead of filing a counterclaim in Suit 821. As the Judge had found, the respondent had not identified any legitimate juridical advantages associated with proceeding in the BVI. In addition, the appellant had indicated that she was prepared to undertake, should the anti-suit injunction be granted, to consent to judgment in the BVI on terms that are identical to the terms of any Singapore judgment that the respondent might obtain (at <strong>[95]</strong>).</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><strong><em>Whether the appellate court was precluded from granting the anti-suit injunction based on issue estoppel </em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">14        The Court of Appeal held that the fact that the BVI court had declined to stay its proceedings did not give rise to an issue estoppel in the present appeal. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Where the foreign court declines to stay its proceedings, an issue estoppel would not necessarily operate to preclude the court hearing the anti-suit injunction application from considering the merits of the application. This was since the test for anti-suit injunctions differed from that for stay applications on <em>forum non conveniens</em> grounds (at <strong>[99]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">15        In addition, if issue estoppel was to apply in the manner advanced by the respondent, the court that was second in time would effectively always be precluded from considering the application before it, though the application was strictly speaking different from that which was considered by the foreign court. Such an approach led to arbitrary outcomes and was not supported by the case law (at <strong>[103]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><strong><em>Whether the pursuit of the BVI proceedings by the respondent was vexatious or oppressive</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">16        Finally, the </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Court of Appeal held that even where the foreign court has declined to stay its proceedings, it would not invariably be a breach of comity for the domestic court to grant an anti-suit injunction if it finds that (a) it is clearly the more appropriate forum for the dispute; <em>and</em> (b) the defendant in the application has acted in a vexatious or oppressive manner in commencing the foreign proceedings (at <strong>[129]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">17        The Court of Appeal found that there was a common recognition in the case law that where the domestic court had a sufficiently close connection with the dispute (such as where it was the natural forum) and the pursuit of the foreign proceedings was found to be unconscionable, the grant of the injunction was less likely to infringe principles of comity (at <strong>[113]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">18        While the Court of Appeal agreed with the principle that it was generally for the court in which proceedings were brought to determine whether it was the natural forum for the dispute, it explained that this principle did not apply with equal force where a defendant had deliberately carved out a specific issue from a pending suit and commenced proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction in respect of this issue. In such circumstances, it could not be said that the foreign court was necessarily in a better position to determine if it was the natural forum for the dispute, having regard to the overall dispute between the parties (at <strong>[122]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">19        Given its findings that Singapore was the natural forum for the dispute and that the respondent had acted in a vexatious and oppressive manner in pursuing BVI 83, the Court of Appeal held that the grant of the anti-suit injunction did not breach comity notwithstanding the BVI court’s decision not to stay its proceedings (at <strong>[132]</strong>). In addition, the Court of Appeal explained that to allow comity to operate in the manner advanced by the respondent would mean that the outcome of the appeal would be dependent on the scheduling of the cases in the two courts, <em>ie</em>, whether the appeal against the refusal of the anti-suit injunction, or the application to stay the foreign action was heard first. Given that the overarching consideration in an anti-suit injunction application was whether the ends of justice require that the injunction be granted, the determination should not be dependent on the scheduling of cases (at <strong>[134]</strong>).</span></p>
