        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
plaintiffs filed a writ action on 4 February 2014 against the defendants
for misappropriation of money. The defendants are resident in Japan.
The plaintiffs then filed an application in Summons No 561 of 2014 for
a freezing order to prevent the defendants from accessing or moving money
in various bank accounts, and to allow the plaintiffs to serve the
writ on the first to fourth defendants in Japan, “by post or courier
and/or by service through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On
10 February 2014, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J granted leave to plaintiffs
for service out of jurisdiction. The writ, but not the statement
of claim and the seven affidavits (which were filed in support of
the writ) accompanying the writ, was translated in Japanese and
sent by registered post to the first, second and fourth defendants.
For ease of reference, I refer to the first, second and fourth defendants
as ‘the defendants’ collectively in this judgment. There is no dispute
that the defendants received these documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On
29 April 2014 the defendants filed Summons No 2246 of 2014 and on
23 July 2014 the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) set aside the service
of action on the defendants. The AR was of the view that the service
was improper, and further, that the defendants were prejudiced because
they had no knowledge of the Singapore proceedings and had no means
of knowing that their assets in Singapore had been frozen by a freezing
order. The plaintiffs appealed against that decision before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Order
11, r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) governs
the service of originating processes to defendants outside of Singapore.
It distinguishes between countries that have a “Civil Procedure Convention”
with Singapore (O 11, r 4(1)) and those that do not (O 11, r 4(2)).
As it is not disputed that there is no “Civil Procedure Convention” between
Singapore and Japan, I need not concern myself with O 11, r 4(1). Order
11, r 4(2) is applicable, and reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Service
of originating process abroad through foreign governments, judicial
authorities and Singapore consuls or by any other method of service
(O. 11, r. 4)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>4.</b> –…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Where
in accordance with these Rules an originating process is to be served
on a defendant in any country with respect to which there does not subsist
a Civil Procedure Convention providing for service in that country
of process of the High Court, the originating process may be served
–</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    through the government
of that country, where that government is willing to effect service;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    through
a Singapore consular authority in that country, except where service
through such an authority is contrary to the law of that country;
or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    by
method of service authorised by the law of that country for service
of any originating process issued by that country.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Order 11,
rr 4(2)(a) and (b) are not applicable. The originating process was
not served through the Japanese government, nor is there is any
evidence that it is willing to effect service on behalf of the plaintiffs.
The originating process was not served through a Singapore consular
authority either. Order 11, r 4(2)(c) applies to present case. It
requires the plaintiffs to comply with the method of service authorised
by the domestic law of the foreign jurisdiction (in this case, Japan).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       There
is little doubt that the service was not properly effected. Under Japanese
law, the writ (and accompanying documents) must be served through
Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and then through court clerks authorised
by the Japanese courts. The writ (and its accompanying documents)
in the present case was not served by a court clerk authorised by
the Japanese court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mr Salem,
counsel for the plaintiff, relied on both Article 118(ii) of Japan’s
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) and the decision of the Supreme Court
of Japan in <em>Kishinchando Narindas Sadhwani,
Sadhwanis Japan v Sadhwani, Gobindram Sadhwani</em> (Case
No 1838(O) of 1994 dated 28 April 1998) (“<em>Sadhwani</em>”)
for the proposition that if a defendant appears in foreign proceedings,
service is validly effected. I do not think that these aid Mr Salem’s
submission. Article 118 of the CCP reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 118 A final and binding judgment
rendered by a foreign court shall be effective only where it meets
all of the following requirements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(i) The jurisdiction of the foreign court
is recognised under laws or regulations or conventions or treaties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) The defeated defendant has received
a service (excluding a service by publication or any other service
similar thereto) of a summons or order necessary for the commencement
of the suit, or has appeared without receiving such service.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iii) The content of the judgment and the
court proceedings are not contrary to public policy in Japan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iv) A mutual guarantee exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I think that Mr Salem has relied on Article 118(ii) out of
context. First, Article 118 should be read in its entirety. It sets
out four conditions that have to be satisfied for a “final and binding
judgment rendered by a foreign court” to be effective in Japan and
not just one condition. Second, Article 118 applies only to “final
and binding” judgments, which is not the case here. There is no
final and binding judgment issued by the Singapore courts. The matter
is only at the interlocutory hearing stage and has not proceeded
to trial yet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       
          <em>Sadhwani</em> concerned the enforcement of
an order for costs obtained in the Hong Kong court following a contested
hearing attended by the defendants who were based in Japan. Service
on the defendants in Japan was irregular but they nonetheless entered
an appearance and contested the action. The defendants lost. In
the course of the enforcement hearing in Japan for the Hong Kong
judgment on costs, the defendants argued that the service was irregular
and that therefore they should not be made to pay costs. The court
rejected this argument as the defendants had actual knowledge of
the commencement of the action and were not hindered in the exercise
of their right to defend the action. This decision may suggest that,
as a general proposition, defendants who contest proceedings with actual
knowledge of the commencement of actions cannot raise arguments on
irregular service. But I do not think so. The case does not stand
for such a broad general proposition. The defendants in that case
had participated fully in the proceedings in Hong Kong. It was at
the very late stage of enforcement of judgment that they raised
an argument on irregular service. <em>Sadhwani</em> is
relevant insofar as it recognises specific instances in which irregular
service could be challenged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Salem’s
alternative ground is that even if there was failure on the plaintiffs’
part in effecting proper service, the court ought not to have set aside
the service of process because the defendants were not at all prejudiced
by the irregularity. The High Court in <em>ITC
Global Holdings Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v ITC Ltd and Others</em> [2011]
SGHC 150 considered this point and Lee Seiu Kin J held that where
a defendant, such as the one before him, is apprised of the proceedings,
it should be regarded as an important factor against an application
to set aside service of process. I agree entirely. The rule is not
designed as a technical obstacle but as a rule to prevent foreign
parties from orders made against them without their knowledge. They
must be aware of the process instituted against them to decide whether
they should resist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Thus
I turn to Mr Salem’s submission’s submission as to the absence of
prejudice in this case. Mr Salem submitted that the plaintiffs’
Japanese lawyer’s letter accompanying the writ gave sufficient notice
of the Singapore proceedings. It is written in Japanese, a language
understood by the defendants, and provides, <em>inter
alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
defendants were sued in Singapore for misappropriation of monies;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     a
freezing order was obtained against the defendants;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     strict
timelines in the Rules of Court have to be observed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     if
the defendants intended to defend the action, they should respond;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
defendants had the right to challenge the freezing order; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
defendants should seek legal advice from a Singapore law firm or
law firm familiar with Singapore’s legal process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Furthermore,
Mr Salem said that the defendants were aware of the proceedings
in Singapore and that they took steps to defend them. This can be
seen from the conduct of the defendants in the Singapore proceedings. The
defendants entered appearance on 14 March 2014. The first defendant also
filed an affidavit to say that after the defendants instructed their (previous)
solicitors FocusLaw Corporation, they ‘started to understand’ what
was happening in Singapore. In compliance with the freezing order, the
defendants also filed a list of their assets on 21 March 2014. Sums
of money ranging from $30,000 to $45,000 were withdrawn by the defendants for
payment of their legal fees in this action. Notice of these withdrawals was
also given to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
defendants’ previous lawyers who had written on 19 February 2013
to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to say that they had just been instructed then
wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court on 25 March 2014 in which
it is clear that the Statement of Claim had been ‘translated into Japanese’.
At the same time, the defendants’ previous solicitors wrote to the plaintiffs’
solicitors to say that they wished to adjourn the pre-trial conference
scheduled to take place the next day, 26 March 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On
15 July 2014 the plaintiffs’ solicitors enquired if the defendants’ solicitors
had instructions to accept service on behalf of their clients. The defendants’
solicitors replied to say that they will seek their clients’ instructions.
On 16 July 2014 the solicitors for both parties appeared before the
AR on the defendants’ application to set aside the writ. Judgement
was reserved till 23 July 2014. In the interim, the defendants’
previous solicitors wrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors and for
the first time, complained that the statement of claim had not been
translated into English. On 23 July 2014 the AR allowed the defendants’
application and set aside the writ and statement of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On
4 August 2014 the defendants’ appointed their present solicitors (JLC
Advisors LLP) to take over from their previous solicitors (FocusLaw Corporation).
Although the defendants changed solicitors, the lawyer who acted
for them in FocusLaw Corporation remains the lawyer advising them in
JLC Advisors LLP, namely, Mr Shem Khoo. Reviewing the exchange of correspondence
written by Mr Shem Khoo on behalf of the defendants to the plaintiffs’
solicitors, and the documented narrative of the events, I am satisfied
that the defendants have not been prejudiced by the irregularity
in service of process. They not only knew that process had been
instituted against them in Singapore, but they were constantly advised
by Singapore lawyers and cannot now say that the irregularity in
service justified their application to set aside the process. From
the documents, the defendants were given substantive advice not
only in respect of the claim, but also on the freezing order – and
what they could and could not do under that order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr
Shem Khoo, the defendants’ lawyer, argued that the defendants were
prejudiced as they could not understand English and therefore could not
understand the court documents served on them, let alone know of
and defend the case against them. There is no merit in this argument.
The mere fact that the defendants themselves did not understand
English is immaterial. As mentioned, the defendants were apprised
of the proceedings in Singapore, took active steps in them, and
had instructed their Singapore solicitors (who in turn advised the
defendants on the proceedings in Singapore). Furthermore, the content
of the Statement of Claim and affidavits accompanying the writ was
already explained to the defendants in Japanese. The defendants’
previous solicitors (FocusLaw Corporation) explained these documents
to them using interpreters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     For
the reasons above I allow the plaintiffs’ appeal with costs here
and below to the plaintiffs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
