At about 4.35pm, Checkpoint Inspector Leong Mun Wai (“CI Leong”) and Sergeant Noor Helmi Bin Ali (“Sgt Helmi”) directed the Trailer to a Cargo Clearance Centre checking bay for a routine check. The accused’s belongings were checked in his presence at a table next to the checking bay. During the checks, Sgt Helmi found a screwdriver (the “screwdriver”) and a red pencil case containing one syringe needle and one empty straw in the accused’s bag. When questioned by Sgt Helmi about the items, the accused stated that he did not know what they were for. An ion swab that was conducted on the accused’s hands, wallet and pencil case showed positive results for methamphetamine.

First, wilful blindness is treated as being the legal equivalent of actual knowledge (at [123]). Second, suspicion is legally sufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness, as long as “that level of suspicion … <span class="font-italic">then lead[s] to a refusal to investigate further</span> [emphasis in original]”. As the court elaborates (at [125]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As Lord Scott aptly put it …, “[s]uspicion is a word that can be used to describe a state-of-mind that may, at one extreme, be no more than a vague feeling of unease and, at the other extreme, reflect a firm belief in the existence of the relevant facts”. … [S]<span class="font-italic">uspicion</span><span class="font-italic"> is a central as well as integral part of the entire doctrine of wilful blindness</span>. However, the caveat is that a <span class="font-italic">low level</span> of suspicion premised on a factual matrix that would <span class="font-italic">not</span> lead a person to make further inquiries would be insufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness where the person concerned did not in fact make further inquiries. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 While the court stated that the inquiry is a highly fact-intensive one, it was clear in stating that (at [129], [130]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [O]ne obvious situation is where the accused takes <span class="font-italic">no steps whatsoever to investigate his or her suspicions</span>.

Despite the accused’s assertions at trial that he and Mogan were “close”, this rang hollow in the face of evidence to the contrary.

At trial, the accused admitted that he did not know basic details such as Mogan’s full name, or whether Mogan was his real name, or anything about Mogan at all; his only dealings with Mogan were in relation to drugs.

</div> In fact, the accused never weighed any of the bundles of <span class="font-italic">marunthu</span>, including the bundle of drugs in the present charge. The accused even admitted that he was “not concerned” about their weight. It bears reminding that the gross weight of the bundle of drugs in the present charge was 455.0g. Such evidence clearly revealed the accused’s indifference to the quantity of drugs that he had in his possession. The present case is thus amongst a particular class of cases described in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kiam Peng</span> (discussed above at [40]), where the accused takes no steps whatsoever to investigate his suspicions. This would be an “obvious situation” of wilful blindness.

Though the accused was confronted with prior opportunities to mention his defence, he did so for the first time only at trial. Glaringly, the accused had omitted to mention anything to the effect that (a) Mogan had assured him that the bundle of drugs only contained “half a stone” of <span class="font-italic">marunthu</span>; and (b) he agreed to Mogan’s proposal by reason of his trust in this assurance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The accused attempted to justify this by saying that he was still under the impression that he had possessed “half a stone” of <span class="font-italic">marunthu</span>, as he was given just one bundle of <span class="font-italic">marunthu</span>. However,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the corollary of this account would be that <span class="font-italic">the moment</span> the accused realised that he was <span class="font-italic">not </span>merely possessing<span class="font-italic"> </span>“half a stone”, but a “full stone”, it was imperative for the accused to mention his defence. However, the accused did not do so at two vital points:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused claimed that he only realised the bundle of drugs weighed a “full stone” when it was weighed in his presence by the CNB officers. However, he did not mention his defence to the CNB officers when the bundle of drugs was weighed and he came to this realisation. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) According to the evidence of SI Shafiq, and undisputed by the Defence, the weighing of the bundle took place on 26 March 2016 at about 3.21am.

</div> This must not be misconstrued as a reference to the defence he relied on at trial – it lacked specificity and amounted to no more than an expression of regret, particularly when read together with his plea for leniency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Furthermore, the accused claimed that he did not “tell more about” Mogan before the trial because he was fearful of the harm that Mogan, a “fighter in Malaysia”, might inflict on his family. However, this explanation was illogical. It appeared that the only information the accused did not reveal in his statements was Mogan’s purported reassurances that the bundle of drugs only contained “half a stone”. Apart from this, the accused had already implicated Mogan in his statements as the one who proposed the entire plan to import drugs into Singapore. This “reason” offered by the accused was therefore no reason at all for his belated defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In sum, the accused’s failure to mention his defence at all during investigations was telling, and his attempted justifications inadequately explained his failure to do so. Therefore, in my judgment, the accused’s defence that he thought he was bringing into Singapore only “half a stone” of diamorphine was evidently an afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The vagueness of the accused’s defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Even if I took the accused’s account at the highest, it was still not entirely clear what he meant – in terms of the weight of the drugs – by saying that he thought he was carrying “half a stone” of diamorphine so as to constitute a defence to the charge. The accused admitted that he <span class="font-italic">did</span><span class="font-italic"> not know</span> what the <span class="font-italic">weight</span> of a “full stone” was. There was thus no basis to claim that “half a stone” was less than 18.85g, or even a non-capital amount. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Having reviewed the evidence in totality, I rejected the accused’s account that he thought the bundle contained “half a stone”, which would only attract ten years’ imprisonment. It was a defence raised late in the day, and was not credible. I found that the accused had a suspicion that the amount of <span class="font-italic">marunthu</span> he carried was a capital amount, and that he deliberately shut his eyes to this suspicion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The present case is distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ng Peng Chong</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2017] SGHC 99 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Peng Chong</span>”), where the court found that the accused persons only had knowledge of one pound of heroin in their possession, and not the two pounds of heroin they were found with. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Peng</span> <span class="font-italic">Chong</span>, not only did the accused persons consistently maintain their defence from the point of arrest, to the recording of their statements, and to their oral testimonies at trial, there was also objective evidence in the form of text messages that they had a general pattern of ordering only one or half a pound of heroin. In contrast, there was no such objective evidence or consistency in the accused’s account in the present case. In any event, the defence was so vague that it did not constitute a defence to the charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Based on all the facts and circumstances, I found that the accused was wilfully blind to the quantity of drugs that he was delivering, and that it attracted capital punishment. This amounted to actual knowledge of the quantity of drugs he had in his possession, which he knowingly or intentionally brought into Singapore. Accordingly, I found that the charge had been made out against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I convicted the accused of the charge. In coming to this decision, I did not think it was necessary for the Prosecution to rely on the presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on sentencing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The prescribed punishment under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is death, although the alternative sentencing regime in s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA provides the court a discretion to impose a mandatory term of life imprisonment and not less than 15 strokes of the cane where (i) the offender satisfies the court that his acts fall within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)–(iv) of the MDA, and (ii) the Public Prosecutor certifies that the offender has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Here, I found on the balance of probabilities that the accused’s role in the drug transaction was to bring the drugs into Singapore and then to deliver the drugs to Abang. His acts therefore fell within those of a courier. The accused was also issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the Public Prosecutor. As such, the alternative sentencing regime was available. I saw no reason to impose the death penalty, nor did the Prosecution submit that there was any such reason. I imposed the alternative mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, with effect from 26 March 2016. As it was mandatory to do so, I imposed 15 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">April Phang, Sia Jiazheng and Desmond Chong (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution; <br/>Mahadevan Lukshumayeh (Lukshumayeh Law Corporation) and Zaminder Singh Gill (Hilborne Law LLC) for the accused. <br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
