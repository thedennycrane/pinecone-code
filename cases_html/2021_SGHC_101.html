The entity ground can affect only the quantum of damages that the first defendant can recover for the first plaintiff’s breach.

Further, it is also the case that an assessment of damages does not have a separate pleadings phase in which each party is required to plead its case on damages with the same degree of specificity and detail as it is required to set out its case on liability. Bearing these points in mind, it appears to me that the first defendant has had reasonable notice of the case it has to meet on the entity ground, even though it is unpleaded, and a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present a case to meet it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The first defendant raised the failure to plead the entity ground in its written closing submissions.

</div>
</div> Neither Dr Peloso nor Mr Chan is legally trained. As such, they cannot be expected to express their intent “with the exactitude that might be expected of experienced legal draftsmen” (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On </span>at [74]). In these circumstances, it is appropriate to adopt a “common sense approach” to interpreting their agreement rather than a technical or legalistic approach that unduly focuses on its structure and language: <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On </span>at [74].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Interpreting cl 3(b) contextually shows that the first defendant was to receive fees only if “SE” received payments under the Scheme. The interrelated commercial and contractual concepts in cl 3 taken as a whole and in context establish that that was the contractual trigger for the first defendant’s right to receive fees. I say that for three reasons. First, the first sentence of cl 3(b) provides that the “Total Annual Receipt” is a “net positive payment” comprising a fixed annual payment and quarterly payments. Admittedly, cl 3(b) does not expressly provide that it must be “SE” who receives the “net positive payment” and the “quarterly payments” under the Scheme. But cl 3(a) is the only other provision which uses the concept of a “net positive payment”. Clause 3(a) expressly provides that it is “SE” who receives the “net positive payment” under the Scheme. Second, this is reinforced by cll 3(c) and 3(d), which refer to “SE” receiving the annual and quarterly payments. Finally, cl 3(e) also contemplates that any deferred part of the Total Annual Receipt will be received by “SE”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The issue therefore is whether “SE” in any part of cl 3 can be interpreted to mean or include SEP, rather than meaning only the first plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Interpretation of “SE”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As I have mentioned (see [7] above), the Agreement defines “SE” to mean “Sun Electric Pte Ltd” and nothing else. Despite this, the first defendant submits that “SE” in cl 3 (other than in cl 3(b)) is capable of being interpreted in context as meaning any entity in the Sun Electric group and not as meaning the first plaintiff alone.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In applying the contextual approach to contractual interpretation, the court will first consider the plain language of the contract and the admissible extrinsic material that is objective evidence of its context: <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich</span>”) at [130]. If the plain language of the contract leads to an absurd result based on the objective evidence available, this indicates that the text is probably inconsistent with the context. The question then arises as to whether, having had regard to the context, the text on a re-examination is in fact as plain and unambiguous as it was originally thought to be: <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd)</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1187 (“<span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span>”) at [31]. If the meaning of the text remains plain and unambiguous even upon a re-examination and even though it leads to an absurd result, the court must give effect to that meaning if the objective evidence shows that the parties knew of the possibility that the contract might lead to an absurd result yet chose to enter into the contract regardless: <span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span> at [32].

But I do not accept that the use of three different terms in cl 4(a) allows me to use the Agreement’s context to interpret “SE” as being anything other than a contractual synonym for the first plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Of the three different terms in cl 4(a), “Sun Electric Pte Ltd” is the full name of the first plaintiff. The parties cannot have intended it to mean anything other than the first plaintiff. “Sun Electric” is admittedly the first two words of both the first plaintiff’s name and of SEP’s name. It could arguably also be interpreted as a reference to the Sun Electric group. But “Sun Electric” too cannot be intended to mean anything other than the first plaintiff. That is because cl 4(a) refers to the “fees received from Sun Electric” by the first defendant. It is common ground that the only entity obliged to <span class="font-italic">pay</span> fees to the first defendant under cl 3(b) is the first plaintiff. So “Sun Electric” must mean the first plaintiff as well. The result is that the parties intended both “Sun Electric Pte Ltd” and “Sun Electric” in cl 4(a) to mean the first plaintiff, and only the first plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The parties therefore did not intend to draw any distinction between the meaning of “Sun Electric Pte Ltd” and the meaning of “Sun Electric”. The fact that they also used the defined term “SE” in cl 4(a) does not show that they intended “SE” to be something other than a contractual synonym for the first plaintiff for the purposes of cl 4, let alone for the purposes of cl 3. In fact, the drafting of cl 4(a) suggests quite the opposite. It suggests that the parties used a number of terms (including the defined term “SE”) interchangeably to refer to only <span class="font-italic">one</span> entity, the first plaintiff, and not to any other entity or group of entities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The first defendant seeks to draw an analogy between this case and <span class="font-italic">Amalgamated Investment &amp; Property Co Ltd (in </span><span class="font-italic">liq) v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd</span> [1982] QB 84 (“<span class="font-italic">Amalgamated Investment</span>”). In that case, a guarantor guaranteed a principal debtor’s indebtedness to a bank in anticipation of the bank concluding a loan agreement with the principal debtor. The guarantee was drafted in the first person and addressed to the bank in the second person. It obliged the guarantor to pay the bank on demand “all moneys…due or owing or payable to <span class="font-italic">you</span>…by the principal” (emphasis added). The bank and the guarantor intended this phrase to mean moneys which the principal debtor owed to the <span class="font-italic">bank itself</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 After the guarantee was executed, the structure of the anticipated loan changed. For reasons unrelated to the guarantor and the principal debtor, the bank decided that its subsidiary (and not the bank itself) would be the lender under the loan agreement with the principal debtor. Under the loan agreement, therefore, there would now never be any money owing by the principal debtor to <span class="font-italic">the bank</span>. The principal debtor would owe money only to the bank’s <span class="font-italic">subsidiary</span>. Despite this, the bank did not ask the guarantor to execute a fresh guarantee promising to pay the bank on demand all moneys owing to the <span class="font-italic">subsidiary</span> by the principal debtor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Eveleigh LJ and Brandon LJ (as he then was) readily interpreted the phrase “all moneys…owing…to <span class="font-italic">you</span>” [emphasis added] in the guarantee as meaning all moneys which the principal debtor owed to the bank’s <span class="font-italic">subsidiary</span> and not to the bank itself. Both judges arrived at their decision by using as an interpretive aid the context which existed when the loan agreement was concluded, which was <span class="font-italic">after</span> the guarantee was executed. They did so on the basis that the guarantee was a part of a large transaction including the loan agreement: at 124G and 128H-129A. The larger transaction was concluded only when the loan agreement was executed. It was therefore legitimate to interpret the guarantee by reference to the context which existed when the loan agreement was concluded. That context allowed Eveleigh LJ and Brandon LJ to construe “you” as meaning the bank’s subsidiary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 <span class="font-italic">Amalgamated Investment</span> is of little assistance to the first defendant. If the first defendant relies on <span class="font-italic">Amalgamated Investment </span>to submit that a contract should be interpreted in the context that exists at the time it is concluded, that is simply the contextual approach. I have already accepted that. What I do not accept is that the text in this case allows any scope for the context to add to or vary the meaning of the text. If the first defendant relies on <span class="font-italic">Amalgamated Investment </span>to submit instead that a contract may be interpreted in context which arises after the contract is concluded, that proposition is contrary to the basis on which <span class="font-italic">Amalgamated Investment</span> was decided and is contrary to the objective of the contextual approach. That objective is to ascertain the parties’ intention at the time a contract is concluded. In any event, when the parties executed the Agreement, they already knew that it was SEP and not the first plaintiff who would receive the payments under the Scheme. That is quite unlike the position in <span class="font-italic">Amalgamated Investment</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In summary, the meaning of the text of cl 3 is so clear that there is no scope for the context to prevail over its meaning. That is so even though the meaning of the text leads to the wholly absurd and uncommercial result that the first defendant was obliged to provide services to the first plaintiff with no possibility whatsoever of receiving any fees. At the same time, it is equally clear that this absurd and uncommercial result is one which neither party could have intended. That suggests that the criteria for rectification may be satisfied. I therefore turn to consider rectification.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Common law rectification</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No clear mistake on the face of the Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 A court has the power when construing a contract to correct “obvious mistakes in the written expression of the intention of the parties”: <span class="font-italic">Edwards Jason Glenn</span><span class="font-italic"> v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd </span>[2012] SGHC 61 (“<span class="font-italic">Edwards Jason Glenn</span>”) at [60], citing Kim Lewison, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2011) at para 9.01.

The UK Supreme Court and the English Court of Appeal have begun to retreat from these advanced positions: Paul S Davies, “Rectification Rectified” (2020) 79(1) CLJ 8 at p 11.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For two reasons, I prefer to decide this case on the basis that Lord Hoffman’s extension in <span class="font-italic">Chartbrook</span> of the first <span class="font-italic">East v Pantiles </span>element is not part of Singapore law. First, the parties did not address me on whether Lord Hoffman’s extension can be part of Singapore law despite the authorities binding on me and the constraints of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). Second, it appears to me that Lord Hoffman’s approach, manifested not only in <span class="font-italic">Chartbr</span><span class="font-italic">ook</span> but also in other cases, blurs the important distinctions between: (a) contractual interpretation; (b) implication of terms in fact; (c) common law rectification; and (d) equitable rectification. Each of these doctrines is based on different historical and conceptual underpinnings and addresses different shortcomings of the law of contract. Subject only to the provisions of the Act, my view is that the distinctions between these doctrines are important and should be observed and preserved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I therefore prefer to decide this case on equitable rectification rather than common law rectification. Before I leave this topic, however, I make a few observations on common law rectification and the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Observations on the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The effect of Lord Hoffmann’s extension of the first <span class="font-italic">East v Pantiles</span> element is <span class="font-italic">always</span> to allow the court to consider an instrument’s background and context in ascertaining whether there is a clear mistake on the face of the instrument.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In English law, the contextual approach is purely a common law doctrine. It was therefore open to Lord Hoffman to extend English law as he did, in the usual incremental way in which the common law develops. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In Singapore, however, the contextual approach must operate within the constraints of the Act: see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>([59] above) at [39]. That is especially true of common law rectification. Proviso (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to s 94 of the Act exempts <span class="font-italic">equitable</span> rectification from the parol evidence rule embodied in s 94 of the Act: Goh, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts in Singapore </span>at paras 12.048–12.051; Sudipto Sarkar &amp; V R Manohar, <span class="font-italic">Sarkar’s Law of Evidence in India, </span><span class="font-italic">Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma &amp; Ceylon</span> (Wadhwa and Company, 15th Ed, 1999) (“<span class="font-italic">Sarkar</span>”) at p 1358. There is no analogous proviso which exempts common law rectification from the parol evidence rule. Common law rectification must therefore operate only within the constraints of the Act. As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On </span>([40] above), the scope of common law rectification is “greatly circumscribed” by the Act: at [61], citing Goh Yihan, “Clarifying Rectification in Singapore” (2015) 27 SAcLJ 403.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Lord Hoffman’s extension of the first <span class="font-italic">East v Pantiles</span> element is therefore too broad to be accepted into Singapore law without close examination to reconcile it with the constraints of the Act. The potential for conflict with the Act is real. It does appear to me, however, that in narrowly defined situations, ss 97 and 99 of the Act allow – and may even be said to require – the court to consider extrinsic evidence of background and context on both <span class="font-italic">East </span><span class="font-italic">v Pantiles</span> elements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Section 95 of the Act is a significant constraint on common law rectification in Singapore.

Although there is no clear mistake on the face of the document, the Act allows extrinsic evidence to be adduced to prove that there is nevertheless a mistake in the document which becomes clear once the context is appreciated.

Those sections make extrinsic evidence admissible even if the mistake is not clear <span class="font-italic">on the face</span> of the instrument. It suffices that the mistake becomes clear once extrinsic evidence is admitted under ss 97 or 99. For example, the Indian equivalent to s 97 of the Act has been used to admit extrinsic evidence to show that a creditor’s name was wrongly written as <span class="font-italic">K </span>instead of <span class="font-italic">R</span>: <span class="font-italic">Aijaz v </span><span class="font-italic">Ramsarup </span>A 1931 O 54, cited in <span class="font-italic">Sarkar</span> at p 1424.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 But this approach is permissible only when the conditions of s 97 or s 99 are satisfied, not in every case of common law rectification.

In this case, there is no doubt that the Agreement was intended to record a prior concluded agreement. In light of that, the entire agreement clause does not preclude rectification: “a term that says ‘all the terms are in the document’ (which is, essentially, what an entire agreement clause does) cannot be read as meaning ‘all the terms are in the document when it is in the wrong form’”: Hodge at paras 4-137 and 4-140, citing <span class="font-italic">JJ Huber Ltd v The Private DIY Co Ltd </span>[1995] NPC 102; McMeel at para 17.108.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I accept that the first defendant has discharged its burden of proving its entitlement to equitable rectification on grounds of common mistake.

First, the complete phrase in cl 3(a) is “net positive payment <span class="font-italic">from the [EMA] and the MM Partner</span> under the [Scheme]” [emphasis added]. This phrase formed a part of cl 3(a) from the very first draft of the Agreement. Although I bear in mind that the Agreement was drafted by laymen and should not be interpreted in a technical, legalistic way, I nevertheless consider that the phrase cannot be interpreted so broadly as to encompass the gains and losses on the CFDs. It was open to SEP to enter into CFDs with counterparties other than the MM Partner. Both parties knew this, as seen from Mr Chan’s email to Dr Peloso on 16 April 2015 regarding a draft of the Agreement.

But it was open to SEP to enter into CFDs involving payments at any interval, not only at annual and quarterly intervals. That is why, in June 2015, Mr Chan negotiated the payment intervals for the CFDs with Tong Teik. Mr Chan proposed settling the CFDs on quarterly rather than monthly intervals so as to mirror the quarterly settlement under SEP’s Definitive Agreement with Tong Teik.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Mr Chan’s treatment of the August Payment is evidence of conduct subsequent to the parties’ entry into the Agreement. The Court of Appeal has, in a series of cases over the years, deliberately left open whether subsequent conduct is admissible in interpreting a contract, neither endorsing its use nor prohibiting it: <span class="font-italic">Zurich</span> ([45] above) at [132(d)]; <span class="font-italic">MCH International</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd and others v YG Group Pte Ltd and others and other appeals</span> [2019] 2 SLR 837 (“<span class="font-italic">MCH International</span>”) at [20]–[21]. What is clear is that a court must bear the following three criteria in mind when considering whether to admit evidence of subsequent conduct as an aid to interpreting a contract (<span class="font-italic">MCH International</span> at [18]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the subsequent conduct must be relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties, and relate to a clear and obvious context;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the principle of objectively ascertaining contractual intention(s) remains paramount; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) accordingly, the subsequent conduct must always go toward proof of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Even where evidence of subsequent conduct fulfils these three criteria, the evidence may not be probative of the parties’ intention at the time they entered into the contract. This is because the evidence can be shaped to suit each party’s position with the benefit of hindsight: <span class="font-italic">MCH International</span> at [21], citing <span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine (SEA) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Jiacipto Jiaravanon</span> [2019] 1 SLR 696 at [78]. Indeed, once a party appreciates that a dispute is imminent, the subsequent conduct itself can be shaped in this way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The first defendant does not object to the admissibility of evidence about the August Payment. Neither does it argue that, because it is evidence of subsequent conduct, it should carry less weight in interpreting cl 3. Since I have not heard arguments on this issue, I make no decision on whether this evidence is admissible as an interpretive aid. Instead, I assume in the first plaintiff’s favour that it is admissible. Even on that assumption I do not consider that the parties’ treatment of the August Payment assists the first plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I accept that the August Payment was invoiced and paid as part of the first defendant’s fees under cl 3(b) of the Agreement.

I do not find the circumstances surrounding the August Payment in July and August 2015 sufficiently probative of the parties’ intention in April 2015, when they entered into the Agreement. In my view, there are alternative explanations for their subsequent conduct in July and August 2015. The August Payment could have been the result of a bilateral mistake, with both parties labouring under a misapprehension in July and August 2015 about what they had agreed in April 2015 or about the contractual effect of cl 3 of the Agreement. Or it could have been the result of a unilateral mistake by Dr Peloso in July and August 2015.

I shall then consider the parties’ written submissions, with further oral submissions if considered necessary, and render my decision on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Chee San (TanLim Partnership) for the plaintiffs and defendant-in-counterclaim;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Lip Chih (Foo &amp; Quek LLC) (instructed), Jennifer Sia and Rezvana Fairouse (NLC Law Asia LLC) for the defendants and plaintiff-in-counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
