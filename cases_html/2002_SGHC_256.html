</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        The facts as can be gathered from the pleadings

and evidence adduced at the trial below established that two trailers belonging to the

plaintiffs (the appellants herein) were at the material time in the defendants’ (the

respondents herein) warehouse premises. In the event, there was a fire at the

defendants’ premises and the said trailers were damaged. The plaintiffs estimated the

damages to be in the sum of $28,063.00 and claimed the said amount from the defendants on

grounds that the trailers were at the premises of the defendants at the latter’s

invitation for the purposes of loading and unloading; the defendants were negligent; they

were in breach of occupier’s duty; and that the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquiter</i>

applied. The plaintiffs provided particulars of the defendants’ alleged breach of

occupiers’ duty but oddly there were no particulars of negligence in the

plaintiffs’ statement of claim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The defendants in their defence denied that the

trailers were in their premises upon their invitation, and averred that the previous

course of dealings between the plaintiffs and the defendants were such that the plaintiffs

parked their vehicles within the premises of the defendants at the plaintiffs’ own

risks and there was no duty of care owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        As to the fire itself, the defendants averred

that the fire occurred owing to no fault or negligence on their part and that they had at

all times acted reasonably and taken all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of

the premises. They also denied that the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> applied in

the situation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        There was no reply filed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned

district judge, after considering all the evidence, dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim

stating that the plaintiffs had failed to prove on balance of probabilities that the

defendants were negligent in causing or permitting the fire to occur in their premises or

had allowed the fire to continue unabated. He further said that there was no evidence that

the defendants had failed to ensure that the plaintiffs’ trailers parked at the

defendants’ warehouse would be reasonably safe nor was there any evidence that there

was any breach of the defendants’ duty as occupiers of their premises. Having

highlighted the absence of particulars of negligence in the plaintiffs’ statement of

claim, the district judge also concluded that there was not even a <i>prima facie</i> case

of negligence as would justify the application of the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        On appeal, the appellant’s counsel

contended that the district judge was in error as to his findings on the aspect of

negligence and said that the plaintiffs had, on balance of probabilities established

negligence on the part of the defendants. He argued that the very nature of the

defendants’ business warranted a conclusion that the fire was an ever present danger

in the defendants’ premises and that the defendants had not taken adequate safeguards

to protect the property of the defendants’ which were on their premises. Counsel for

the appellants also criticised the approach taken by the district judge to discount the

evidence of a defence witness who adopted the report of an investigation where it was

stated that it was possible for the fire to have been started by a carelessly discarded

smoker’s materials.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        On appeal, the plaintiffs no longer relied on

the allegations that the defendants were in breach of their duty as occupiers of the

warehouse nor on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> (page 10 of the appellants’

case).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        There was a segment based on bailment in the

appellants’ case. This however, was never pleaded. The appellants’ case stated

that the appellants would seek to apply to court to amend the statement of claim. However

nothing came to fore and the counsel for the appellants, after suggesting that the

bailment here was gratuitous, confirmed that he was not making any application to amend

the pleadings to include the aspect of bailment at this stage as it was manifest that one

of the elements ie, ‘depositum’ necessary to constitute gratuitous bailment was

neither pleaded nor seemed to have been proved.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        Returning to the appeal before me, the only

issue was whether the district judge was in error in relation to his finding that the

plaintiffs had failed to establish negligence on the part of the defendants. It is a

settled principle of law that the burden of proof in an action for damages for negligence

rests primarily on the plaintiffs.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        Having reviewed the evidence and the grounds

delivered, I am of the view that the overall conclusion reached by the district judge that

negligence was not proven by the plaintiffs on balance of probabilities cannot be faulted.

Although the learned district judge’s treatment of the fire investigation report of a

person not called to give evidence could have been articulated differently, I do not see

any justification or grounds to reverse his findings that the plaintiffs had failed to

cross even the threshold required for the court to find in their favour. At the end of the

day, after all the evidence has been tendered by the contestants, the duty of the court is

to evaluate the evidence in its totality and to arrive at a finding after discarding chaff

from grain. In my view, the court below was entitled to discount an unsubstantiated

surmise, although it surfaced in an investigation report submitted by the defence – a

document which, in any event, was not specifically admitted in evidence and was not agreed

to by the plaintiffs (see para 20 of the decision of the district judge).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        For the reasons appearing herein, I dismissed

the plaintiffs’ appeal with costs.</font></p>
