One matter in the court proceedings, as between the plaintiff (“Silica Investors”) and the second defendant (“Lionsgate”), was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> within the scope of an arbitration agreement, and thus subject to a mandatory stay under s 6 of the IAA (see [122], [136], [137]). The court stayed the rest of the court proceedings pending the resolution of that arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Specifically, the court decided that if Silica Investors wished to proceed with the claim against Lionsgate that was subject to the arbitration clause, that claim would be stayed, and (subject to certain conditions) it was in the interests of case management for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the rest of the court proceedings against Lionsgate to be stayed; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the court proceedings against the other defendants to also be stayed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(See [190], in particular (c), (e), (f).)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The court stated at [186] that in cases “where the dispute which is covered by the arbitration clause in question forms only part of a larger dispute with a broader horizon…the court, as the final arbiter, should take the lead in ensuring the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 At [188], the court further stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This does not mean that if part of a dispute is sent for arbitration, the court proceedings relating to the rest of the dispute <span class="font-italic">will </span>be stayed as a matter of course. The court must in every case aim to strike a balance between three higher-order concerns that may pull in different considerations: first, a plaintiff’s right to choose whom he wants to sue and where; second, the court’s desire to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing the operation of an arbitration clause; and third, the court’s inherent power to manage its processes to prevent an abuse of process and ensure the efficient and fair resolution of disputes. The balance that is struck must ultimately serve the ends of justice. In this regard, we consider that the court’s discretion to stay court proceedings pending the resolution of a related arbitration, at the request of parties who are not subject to the arbitration agreement in question, can in turn be made subject to the agreement of those parties to be bound by any applicable findings that may be made by the arbitral tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The whole action should be stayed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Applying the principles from <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the whole action should be stayed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Regarding the first higher-order concern mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [188] – “a plaintiff’s right to choose whom he wants to sue and where” – the court recognised the following at [187]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “that right is not absolute”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “that right may be curtailed or may even be regarded as subsidiary to holding the plaintiff to his obligation to arbitrate where he has agreed to do so”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that right “is restrained only to a modest extent when the plaintiff’s claim is stayed temporarily pending the resolution of a related arbitration, as opposed to when the plaintiff’s claim is shut out in its entirety” (citing <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> Norway ASA v Goldman Sachs International</span> [1999] CLC 486<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> Norway (HC)</span>”) at 491 per Moore-Bick J).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Regarding the second higher-order concern – the court’s desire to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing the operation of an arbitration clause – a stay under s 6 of the IAA is <span class="font-italic">mandatory</span>, and that necessarily prevails over the court’s desire “to avoid the complications inherent in having to resolve a dispute across two different fora” (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [2], [122], [136], [137]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Regarding the third higher-order concern – the court’s inherent power to manage its processes to prevent an abuse of process and ensure the efficient and fair resolution of disputes – the court can<span class="font-italic"> </span>(as noted in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [139]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “stay the whole of the court proceedings pending the resolution of the putative arbitration, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, resolve the arbitration first” (which Mr Wang asked for);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “resolve that part of the court proceedings which falls outside [the arbitration stay] first”; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) “allow the putative arbitration and the remaining court proceedings to run in parallel” (which Parastate asked for).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the claim that was subject to a mandatory stay under s 6 of the IAA was the “Management Participation Allegation” against Lionsgate (at [137]). That allegation also formed part of Silica Investors’ case against all eight defendants, in which Silica Investors alleged oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct towards it as a minority shareholder. The court decided that it would be logical to have the Management Participation Allegation determined first as between Silica Investors and Lionsgate, and thereafter the rest of the court proceedings could proceed, with the court having the benefit of the arbitral tribunal’s award on the Management Participation Agreement: at [189(a)(iii)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 That reasoning applied with even greater force in the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the court regarded the Management Participation Allegation as “a narrow issue that is subsidiary in importance to the other issues and allegations which have been raised in the Suit.” In contrast, Parastate’s claims against Babel Asia (which were stayed in favour of arbitration) were foundational to all of Parastate’s claims against all of the defendants in the action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Parastate contracted with only one of the four defendants – Babel Asia – and all of Parastate’s claims were premised on Parastate establishing that Babel Asia had breached trustee and/or fiduciary duties, or made fraudulent misrepresentations that had induced Parastate to invest in the Fund. Parastate’s claims against Mr Wang and Mr Yang as individuals, and against Babel Holding as Babel Asia’s shareholder, were claims for accessory liability or personal liability, premised on Babel Asia being liable against Parastate to begin with. If Babel Asia had not breached any trustee or fiduciary duties owed to Parastate, and if Parastate had not been induced to invest by any fraudulent misrepresentations of Babel Asia, all of Parastate’s claims against all of the defendants would fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The disputes that Parastate had agreed to resolve in arbitration with Babel Asia included:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether (having regard to the Management Agreement) Babel Asia owed Parastate trustee and/or fiduciary duties which Babel Asia had breached (which Mr Wang and Mr Yang might have dishonestly assisted in, and which Babel Holdings as Babel Asia’s sole shareholder might be responsible for);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether Parastate had been induced to invest in the Fund by fraudulent misrepresentations by Babel Asia, as contained in the Babel Finance Presentation Deck (which Parastate said Mr Wang and Mr Yang were also personally liable for); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether Babel Asia was a party to a conspiracy against Parastate, in relation to those breaches of duty or misrepresentations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is logical to have all those issues as between Parastate and Babel Asia determined first in arbitration, before Parastate proceeds with its claims against Mr Wang, Mr Yang and Babel Holding in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In its written submissions, Parastate appeared to accept that if the court were bound to stay its claims against Babel Asia pursuant to s 6 of the IAA, Parastate’s claim against the other defendants should “<span class="font-italic">consequently</span>” be stayed;

</div>
</div> Parastate’s submission was to the effect that Mr Wang would seek to “re-litigate” common issues, if Parastate won the arbitration against Babel Asia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 This issue of “re-litigation” was addressed in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [142]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…if the court proceedings were stayed pending the resolution of the putative arbitration between Silica Investors and Lionsgate, then upon the completion of the arbitration, when the matter returns to the court, the remaining defendants may seek to challenge findings made in the arbitration to which they were not party and by which they might not be bound. In our judgment, if the remaining defendants were to do so, they would, in the broad sense, be “re-litigating” issues already decided in the arbitration, even though they were not parties to the arbitration and did not have the opportunity to address the arbitral tribunal on those issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The fact that there might be an attempt to “re-litigate” common issues in court, after the completion of a related arbitration, did not prevent the court in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> from staying the court proceedings pending the resolution of that arbitration. The court in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> explained at [142]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…if the remaining defendants were to challenge the arbitral tribunal’s decision when this dispute returns to the court, that would be contrary to their present stance in seeking a stay of the court proceedings pending arbitration, and might potentially amount to an <span class="font-italic">abuse of the process of the court</span>. [emphasis added.]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The court added at [190(d)] that if Silica Investors offered to arbitrate the Management Participation allegation with the remaining defendants, but the remaining defendants declined that offer:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">then that, coupled with their present stance of asking for a stay of the court proceedings against them on the basis of case management, will provide strong grounds for finding that it would be an <span class="font-italic">abuse of process</span> for them to seek to re-litigate (in the broad sense) the Management Participation Allegation in court after the conclusion of the arbitration between Silica Investors and Lionsgate. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In the event, the court granted a case management stay of the remaining claims pending the resolution of the related arbitration, “regardless of whether or not the remaining defendants accept any offer to arbitrate which Silica Investors may make”: at [191(b)(iii)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As explained in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, an arbitration might only bind those who are party to it, but it does not follow that others in respect of whom court proceedings have been stayed are free to “re-litigate” common issues that have been decided in the arbitration – it may be an <span class="font-italic">abuse of process</span> for them to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Parastate relied on the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Epoch Mineral Pte Ltd v Raffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd</span> [2018] SGHC 223 (“<span class="font-italic">Epoch</span>”) where the plaintiff brought claims against four defendants; the plaintiff’s claims against one defendant (“Raffles” or “RAM”) were stayed in favour of arbitration, but the plaintiff was allowed to continue with its claims against the three remaining defendants in court. The court explained its decision as follows (at [10]–[11]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10 When a plaintiff is claiming that the four defendants had conspired to cause him harm, he is entitled to pursue his claim in court against them even when the court had granted one of them a stay in favour of arbitration. It is true that a potential conflict in the findings of fact may arise between the court and the arbitrator, but that alone is not a reason to stymie the plaintiff against the three defendants who are not concerned in the arbitration. My views here are largely what the Court of Appeal had already expressed in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>. That decision does not represent what counsel for the defendants claim it holds.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 Furthermore, whatever the decision between the plaintiff and Raffles, the arbitrator’s decision will not bind the plaintiff or the other defendants in this action. There is no good reason to delay the action by granting a stay so that the other defendants take their seats as spectators to watch the arbitration proceedings. Justice is best served in this case by having the action proceed forthwith and expeditiously.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The court stated that the putative arbitration between the plaintiff and the first defendant (“RAM”) would not bind the plaintiff or the other defendants in the court proceedings, and noted a potential conflict in findings between the court and the arbitrator. At [10] of the judgment (quoted above) the court referred to <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> in general terms, but there was no specific reference to the discussion in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> about “re-litigation” of findings from the arbitration possibly being an abuse of process. If “re-litigation” of findings from the arbitration might be an abuse of process, the other defendants would not (as the court in <span class="font-italic">Epoch</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>put it) be mere spectators watching the arbitration – that arbitration could substantively affect them in the court proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The decision in <span class="font-italic">Epoch </span>must be understood in the context of that case. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> observed at [186], “[t]he precise measures which the court deploys to achieve [the efficient and fair disposal of the dispute as a whole] will turn on the facts and the precise contours of the litigation in each case.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The <span class="font-italic">Epoch</span> matter proceeded to trial before the General Division of the High Court and the plaintiff obtained judgment against the remaining defendants (<span class="font-italic">Epoch Minerals Pte Ltd v Raffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd and others</span> [2021] SGHC 288 (“<span class="font-italic">Epoch (GD)</span>”). The appeal to the Appellate Division by the fourth defendant (Mr Maroju) failed: <span class="font-italic">Gangadhara </span><span class="font-italic">Brhmendra Srikanth Maroju v Epoch Minerals Pte Ltd</span> [2022] SGHC(A) 35 (“<span class="font-italic">Epoch (AD)</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The claims for which the plaintiff (“EMPL”) obtained judgment may be summarised as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Epoch (AD)</span> at [1], [14], [16]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Maroju was found liable with the second defendant (“AKS”) and the third defendant (“Mr Kamil”) for conspiring to injure EMPL by unlawful means in respect of a total payment of US$700,000 that was given for a purpose that turned out to be untrue;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) US$600,000 of the US$700,000 was paid by EMPL to AKS - Mr Maroju was found liable for dishonest assistance in aiding in AKS’s breach of trust of that US$600,000; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) US$100,000 of the US$700,000 was paid by EMPL to Mr Maroju - there was total failure of consideration in respect of that US100,000 and Mr Maroju was personally liable to repay that sum to EMPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In that case (see <span class="font-italic">Epoch (GD)</span> at [2]–[5]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) EMPL had paid the US$700,000 based on <span class="font-italic">oral</span> representations by Mr Maroju;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the full sum was paid by 3 November 2016, before EMPL was informed that RAM was the party that would be making a US$10m loan (which EMPL had paid the US$700,000 to obtain); RAM was first named in the draft term sheet dated 2 January 2017, and the arbitration agreement between EMPL and RAM came into being when the term sheet was executed;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) even if RAM had never been named as the intended lender, or the term sheet between EMPL and RAM had never been signed, it is evident from the judgment in<span class="font-italic"> Epoch (GD)</span> that the court would still have found Mr Maroju, AKS, and Mr Kamil liable to EMPL – EMPL’s claims against those defendants were <span class="font-italic">not dependent</span> on a finding that RAM was liable to the EMPL; indeed, it was only <span class="font-italic">after</span> EMPL had parted with its money, that RAM’s name was put forward as the intended lender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Each of those points stands in contrast with the present case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Parastate’s case on misrepresentation was based on <span class="font-italic">written</span> representations in the Babel Finance Presentation Deck;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Parastate only invested in the Fund <span class="font-italic">after</span> it entered into the Management Agreement with Babel Asia;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Parastate’s claims against Babel Asia were <span class="font-italic">foundational</span> to its claims against Mr Wang, Mr Yang, and Babel Holding: [28]–[29] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I was not persuaded that a case management was inappropriate in this case, just because such a stay was not granted in <span class="font-italic">Epoch</span> – the precise contours of the litigation in the two cases were very different; in particular, in <span class="font-italic">Epoch</span> the matter that was subject to an arbitration stay was not material to a determination of the rest of the action, but it was central in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 A closer analogy to the present case is <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, where the matter that was subject to an arbitration stay was relied upon by Silica Investors for its oppression claim against <span class="font-italic">all</span> eight defendants: see [26] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Another analogous case where a case management stay was granted is <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> Norway (HC)</span>, discussed in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [164] to [170]. In that case, the plaintiffs (collectively, “Reichhold”) had brought a claim in arbitration against Jotun AS (“Jotun”) pursuant to the arbitration clause in the sale and purchase agreement between Jotun and Reichhold. But Reichhold also sued Goldman Sachs (Jotun’s agent in the transaction) in court. Moore-Bick J stayed the court proceedings against Goldman Sachs pending the resolution of the arbitration between Reichhold and Jotun, noting that under the engagement letter between Goldman Sachs and Jotun, Jotun had agreed to indemnify Goldman Sachs against any liability to Reichhold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The court in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> commented at [170]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Moore-Bick J concluded at 493 that “[i]n practical terms … an award [at the arbitration] might well determine the matter once and for all”. He was alive to the fact that the arbitral award would not <span class="font-italic">bind </span>Goldman Sachs. But, practically, in the context of the specific commercial arrangement between the parties, the outcome of the arbitration would have been dispositive of Reichhold’s claim against Goldman Sachs before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, Goldman Sachs was sued because it was the agent of Jotun (with whom Reichhold had an arbitration agreement). Similarly, Parastate’s claims against Mr Wang, Mr Yang, and Babel Holding were all premised on those defendants’ connections with Babel Asia (with whom Parastate had an arbitration agreement). Parastate contended that Mr Wang, Mr Yang, and Babel Holding were liable on account of their ownership and/or control of Babel Asia: Babel Holding was Babel Asia’s sole shareholder; Mr Wang and Mr Yang were founding shareholders of Babel Holding, and directors of Babel Asia for certain periods of time. Parastate thus contended that Mr Wang, Mr Yang, and Babel Holding had accessory or personal liability for what Babel Asia had done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In such circumstances, as Moore-Bick J put it in <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, “[i]n <span class="font-italic">practical</span> terms…an award [at the arbitration] might well determine the matter once and for all” [emphasis added]. That was echoed somewhat by Parastate’s counsel when I queried at the hearing: what would happen if Parastate lost the arbitration against Babel Asia? He responded that Parastate would have to be <span class="font-italic">practical</span> and decide whether to proceed against the individuals.

</div>
</div>
</div> Indeed, if Parastate sought to  “re-litigate” common issues that had been decided against it in the Parastate – Babel Asia arbitration, that might amount to an abuse of process as discussed in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> (see [35]–[39] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 At the very least, the court would have the benefit of the arbitral tribunal’s decision on the issues as between Parastate and Babel Asia, when the court turns to consider Parastate’s claims against Mr Wang, Mr Yang, and Babel Holding: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [189(a)(iii)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Parastate also relied on the English case of <span class="font-italic">Mabey and Johnson v Jonathan Laszlo </span><span class="font-italic">Danos</span> [2007] EWHC 1094 (“<span class="font-italic">Mabey</span>”) where a case management stay was not granted. In <span class="font-italic">Mabey</span>, the court held at [37] that “[t]he claims against Mr Gibson [who was seeking a stay] are distinct, both legally and conceptually, from the claims against DAG [in respect of which there was a mandatory arbitration stay]”. DAG, the fourth defendant, was an agent of the claimant, Mabey. That agency relationship was governed by a Representative Agreement between DAG and Mabey that contained an arbitration clause; DAG was remunerated by commission. Mabey alleged fraud consisting of a conspiracy to inflate the level of commission and divide up the surplus between DAG and/or Mr Gibson (who was alleged to own or control DAG), and two ex-employees of Mabey – Mr Danos and Mr Joyce.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Henderson J in <span class="font-italic">Mabey</span> described <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> as an “unusual case” and said that the circumstances of <span class="font-italic">Mabey</span> came nowhere near the “rare and compelling circumstances” envisaged by <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> as justifying a stay (at [38]). He further distinguished <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> on the basis that in <span class="font-italic">Reichhold</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> Goldman Sachs was the only defendant, whereas only one (Mr Gibson) of the three remaining defendants in <span class="font-italic">Mabey</span> was seeking a stay of the claims against him. In that regard, in the present case Mr Wang had applied for a stay of the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 <span class="font-italic">Mabey</span> was discussed in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [171]–[174] as part of the review of the position in England. The Court of Appeal went on to hold at [187] that it “would not set the bar for the grant of a case management stay at the “rare and compelling” threshold that the English and the New Zealand courts have adopted.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, the facts of the present case are quite different from those in <span class="font-italic">Mabey</span> – in that case, Mabey had documents showing strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence of fraud involving Mr Gibson, Mr Danos and Mr Joyce as actors to inflate the commissions that DAG would receive from Mabey (at [5]). That does not feature in the present case. Instead, Parastate sought to hold Mr Wang, Mr Yang, and Babel Holding liable for what <span class="font-italic">Babel Asia</span> had done (in the form of representations in the Babel Finance Presentation Deck, or breaches of duties owed by Babel Asia to Parastate pursuant to the Management Agreement between Babel Asia and Parastate).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether conditions should be imposed for a case management stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Finally, there was the issue of whether I should attach conditions to the case management stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>, the court stated at [188] (quoted at [21] above) that the court could grant a case management stay subject to the agreement of the non-arbitrating parties to be bound by any applicable findings by the arbitral tribunal. The court did not, however, impose such a condition in that case (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [190(d)], see also [191(b)(iii)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In a similar vein, I did not make the stay conditional upon the other defendants agreeing to be bound by the Parastate – Babel Asia arbitration. It remains open to Parastate to offer to arbitrate the issues in the arbitration with the other defendants (see <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [190(d)])l; but I left it to Parastate whether to make such an offer, and to the other defendants whether to accept any such offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Nor did I make the stay conditional upon the arbitration being expedited (which was a condition imposed in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [190(e)(i)]). In imposing that condition, the court in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> considered that the matter subject to an arbitration stay was “a narrow issue that is subsidiary in importance to the other issues and allegations which have been raised in the Suit.” In contrast, what is subject to an arbitration stay in the present case is the heart of the dispute between the parties: if the arbitration is decisive on the issue of Babel Asia’s liability to Parastate, only the question of accessory or personal liability of the other defendants remains to be determined thereafter (if at all).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It remains open to Parastate to seek to expedite the arbitration if it truly wishes to do so. At the time of the case management conference on 28 December 2022 (a month after my decision), Parastate had yet to commence arbitration. I do not know if Parastate has since done so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Having granted a mandatory arbitration stay of Parastate’s claims against Babel Asia, I exercised my discretion to stay the rest of the action, to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole, and ultimately serve the ends of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Andre Maniam</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Foo Maw Shen, Chu Hua Yi and Mark Tan (FC Legal Asia LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Choo Zheng Xi and Carol Yuen (Remy Choo Chambers LLC) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Darius Chan and Michael Chan (Breakpoint LLC) for the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ang Ann Liang and Yeoh Tze Ning (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the third and fourth defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
