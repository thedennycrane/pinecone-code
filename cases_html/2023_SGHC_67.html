This claim is based on an oral agreement allegedly entered into by the parties in late 2011 (“the Alleged Oral Agreement”). The defendant, however, denies the existence of the Alleged Oral Agreement.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The defendant’s primary defence is that the Alleged Oral Agreement was never made. Secondly, insofar as the defendant had ever mentioned transferring any assets to the plaintiff, he had done so in a familial context. Accordingly, the defendant had no intention to create legal relations with the plaintiff. Thirdly, the Alleged Oral Agreement, as pleaded, is void for uncertainty of terms. Fourthly, the plaintiff’s claim is barred by the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> in light of DC 1437/2020. Finally, the plaintiff’s claim for the Property fails as the Property is owned by KSC Holding, a distinct legal personality, and not the defendant. KSC Holding is not a party to the present suit.

I summarise some key aspects. First, the court will consider the relevant documentary evidence and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time. In this connection, while the testimony of witnesses is pertinent, relevant documentary evidence and the contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the time of contract formation are generally preferred as more reliable than subsequent witness testimony. Second, where the witnesses are not legally trained, as is the case here, the court should not place undue emphasis on the choice of words. Finally, it should be noted that the fact that there is little to no documentary evidence does not preclude the court from finding the existence of an oral agreement. The court will examine the precise factual matrix to ascertain if there is an oral agreement concluded between the parties. With this framework in mind, I now turn to the plaintiff’s evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The plaintiff’s account of how the Alleged Oral Agreement was entered into is set out at [4] above.

</div> As set out at [4]–[6] above, it is the plaintiff’s evidence that the Alleged Oral Agreement was entered into because the defendant wanted to retain the plaintiff to work for the Company. This was against the background of the plaintiff being headhunted to work for Pasaraya. However, this version is flatly denied by the defendant. In relation to the Letter of Offer, the defendant challenges its authenticity, and objects to its admissibility. In any event, the defendant submits that it does little to prove the existence of the Alleged Oral Agreement, much less its terms.

However, it does not go very far to establish that the plaintiff met the defendant in late 2011 to discuss the matter, that the plaintiff had sought to resign from the Company, and especially that the defendant offered the terms in the Alleged Oral Agreement which the plaintiff purportedly accepted. In particular, I note that allegedly, by the Second Set of Terms, the defendant promised to generously reward the plaintiff in five years’ time to stay with the Company. Even if the Company wished to entice the plaintiff to stay on, it remains questionable whether the defendant would readily offer such a generous package. In sharp contrast to the Letter of Offer, for all that it purportedly promised, the Alleged Oral Agreement makes no mention of the performance expected from the plaintiff in that five-year period. I shall return to this at [66] below. Accordingly, even if the Letter of Offer is admissible, it is of limited assistance in supporting the plaintiff’s case.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alleged performance of the First Set of Terms </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Next, the plaintiff argues that the defendant had performed the First Set of Terms under the Alleged Oral Agreement in 2012.

That statement is nowhere to be found in Mr Yeo’s AEIC. More significantly, Mr Yeo admitted during cross-examination that he was completely unfamiliar with the duties of an expert witness.

Along the same vein, “[i]f it loses, you will have to lose your share of 60 to 70 percent or even lose everything” seems to mean that should the Company lose money, the plaintiff should expect to lose his share of the <span class="font-italic">profits, </span>and not expect to have any gains. There would be no reason for the plaintiff to lose his <span class="font-italic">shares </span>in the Company should the Company not turn in a profit. Moreover, nothing in the Video Recording and Mr Yeo’s Transcript alludes to the Property at all, and accordingly, the Video Recording cannot lend support to the plaintiff’s claim of 60% of the Property.

</div> It is unnecessary for me to set out all of them in full. They concern the Company’s affairs at a time when its business was failing. For instance, the plaintiff’s email dated 24 June 2017 concerns the return of some of the Company’s premises to HDB, while the email dated 30 May 2018 relates to parties’ negotiations for the defendant to buy the plaintiff out. Again, the pertinent observation to make is that, like the 19 April 2018 letter, the emails are silent on the Alleged Oral Agreement, particularly the Second Set of Terms. They do not help the plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In contrast, I note that where the plaintiff had specific points to make, including threats of legal action, he did not shy away from formally making those points known to the defendant (sprinkling legalese along the way).

Pertinently, the article was published on 3 June 2018, well after the relationship between father and son had soured, and well after the letter and emails referred to above were written.

</div> This is entirely unmeritorious. What the defendant pleads is that he did not make any statements to the press at all because he did not wish to publicise his family disputes.

First, by the Second Set of Terms, the plaintiff stands to gain substantial financial benefits by 2016, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>five years of entry into the agreement. Second, despite the generous rewards, there does not seem to be any specific conditions imposed on the plaintiff in running the Company. The plaintiff does not mention any terms relating to his performance. I accept the plaintiff’s assertion that by 2011, he was much valued by the Company. However, even if the defendant needed to entice the plaintiff to stay on, the terms of the Alleged Oral Agreement are, in my view, unusually favourable to the plaintiff. The plaintiff describes the defendant as “a very shrewd businessman”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The plaintiff has a Master’s degree. By 2011, he was an experienced businessman. Although he says he asked the defendant many times to put the agreement into writing, those were all <span class="font-italic">verbal </span>requests. Even if the defendant had refused to do so, the plaintiff could have followed up with a <span class="font-italic">written </span>request. There was none. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I accept that while the father-son relationship was strong, the plaintiff might not have wished to make things difficult for the defendant. However, strangely, the plaintiff also has no other <span class="font-italic">personal </span>written record of the Alleged Oral Agreement. As evident from the 19 April 2018 letter and the emails, the plaintiff is well capable of formally setting out important matters in writing. However, even in the 19 April 2018 letter and the emails, he did not mention the Alleged Oral Agreement. One would have thought that the Second Set of Terms could have assisted the plaintiff in the buyout negotiations. There is complete silence on the part of the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 At the end of the day, it would have been reasonable to expect some form of documentation on the part of the plaintiff. However, as discussed above, there is nothing that points to the existence of the Alleged Oral Agreement. The Video Recording was meant to be the strongest piece of objective evidence to capture the Alleged Oral Agreement, but it failed dismally to do so.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 With that said, I return to the plaintiff’s testimony. Having observed the plaintiff and having considered his evidence against the surrounding facts and circumstances, I do not find the plaintiff a credible witness. The plaintiff has shown a tendency to exaggerate facts. Despite his threat that he has collected “all the facts and video evidence … since the incorporation of the [Company]” to support his case (see [62] above), nothing cogent has been produced at the trial. In fact, the many unsatisfactory aspects surrounding the Video Recording cast doubt on his credibility. I also think he has overstated his contributions to the Company, especially in the years of 1999 to 2003 when he was still pursuing his undergraduate and post-graduate studies, so as to bolster his case. Notwithstanding this, as I have stated, I do agree that by 2011, the plaintiff had become essential to the Company’s operations. Still, I reiterate that it remains incredible that the defendant would resort to giving the plaintiff so much by way of the Second Set of Terms to retain his services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the foregoing reasons, I am unable to accept the plaintiff’s testimony of the existence of the Alleged Oral Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant’s evidence   </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Turning briefly to the defendant’s evidence, I note that the defendant admits that he wished to give the plaintiff a larger role in the Company by appointing him as a director in 2011. In my view, in line with that, around that time, the plaintiff was also given 6% more of the Company’s shares. As for any other of his assets, the defendant’s version is that he has merely discussed succession plans with the plaintiff, including giving away his assets to his five children in the future. Given that the defendant has four other children, with Ms Kwek being a director of the Company, his account is reasonable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff has not proved the Alleged Oral Agreement on a balance of probabilities. While the determination of the first issue is sufficient for me to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety, I shall briefly deal with the closely related matters raised by way of the second and third issues. It is not necessary for me, however, to discuss the fourth and fifth issues, and I shall not be doing so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether parties had any intention to create legal relations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I address the requirement of an intention to create legal relations between parties for a binding and enforceable agreement to arise. At law, there is a presumption that parties in a domestic context have no intention to create legal relations: <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Wui Teck (personal representative of the estate of Chew Chen Chin, deceased) v Ong Wui Swoon and another and another appeal</span> [2019] SGCA 61 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Wui Teck</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45]. This presumption is triggered here as the parties are father and son. The burden is, therefore, on the party seeking to enforce an agreement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiff) to rebut the presumption by proving that parties did in fact intend to create legal relations: <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Wui Teck</span> at [46]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The plaintiff’s case is that the parties intended to create legal relations for two main reasons. First, the plaintiff argues that the parties entered into a valid and enforceable Settlement Agreement with respect to DC 1437/2020. In fact, the defendant has duly paid the plaintiff a settlement sum of S$182,000 without alleging that the parties did not intend to create legal relations in respect of the Settlement Agreement. As such, it is untrue that the parties did not intend the Alleged Oral Agreement to be legally binding.

First, the defendant’s consistent testimony is that insofar as he had ever made statements concerning the distribution of his assets to his children, they were all made in a domestic context, as part of succession planning.

All the defendant’s children, including the plaintiff, were paid salaries and CPF contributions even when they were studying. The plaintiff was also able to become CEO of the Company a mere three years after his graduation from university, at a time when he was still learning the ropes.

First, the plaintiff has no basis for contending that parties had the requisite intention to create legal relations out of discussions regarding the two sets of terms purportedly contained in the Alleged Oral Agreement by virtue of the existence of the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement was made on a without prejudice basis after DC 1437/2020 was brought.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 It is trite that for a contract to be valid and enforceable, its terms must be sufficiently certain. Accordingly, a contract may be unenforceable for want of certainty even though there has otherwise been both offer and acceptance between contracting parties: <span class="font-italic">Chan Tam Hoi (alias Paul Chan) v Wang Jian and other matters</span> [2022] SGHC 192 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Tam Hoi</span>”) at [100], citing <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2022) at p 162. That said, the courts will generally endeavour to uphold a contract as enforceable where possible and be slow to hold a contract as unenforceable for want of certainty of terms: <span class="font-italic">Chan Tam Hoi</span> at [101].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In my view, the Second Set of Terms are uncertain in three main aspects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 First, it is not possible to determine the exact number of shares of the Company in which the plaintiff is supposedly entitled to receive, as the term provides “<span class="font-italic">at least </span>another 60% of the shares in the Company” [emphasis added]. If the phrase “at least” is read with “60% of properties”, the same uncertainty exists. As pleaded, the plaintiff’s entitlement falls within a range of 60% to possibly 100%.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Secondly, it is also unclear what “60% of the properties” mean, and it is not possible to determine how the plaintiff will receive the properties as described in the Second Set of Terms. It is unclear if the plaintiff is entitled to (i) at least a 60% share of <span class="font-italic">each </span>property falling within the description; (ii) several properties that are at least 60% of the total <span class="font-italic">number</span> of properties falling within the description; or (iii) some properties that represent at least 60% of the <span class="font-italic">value</span> of all the properties in the description. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Thirdly, the description of the properties in the Second Set of Terms represents an indeterminate class as they also concern future properties, but no clear method exists to determine what these future properties are or will be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Where a term or agreement is uncertain, and where there is no objective or reasonable method of ascertaining how the term or agreement is to be carried out, the term or agreement is unworkable (<span class="font-italic">Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd</span> [1934] 2 KB 1 at 13; <span class="font-italic">Rudhra</span><span class="font-italic"> Minerals Pte Ltd v MRI Trading Pte Ltd (formerly known as CWT Integrated Services Pte Ltd)</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1023 (“<span class="font-italic">Rudhra</span><span class="font-italic"> Minerals Pte Ltd</span>”) at [32]). Indeed, while a contractual term may provide for a range of options, such a term is uncertain if there is no agreed method to decide on an option within that range (<span class="font-italic">Harwindar</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh s/o Geja Singh v Wong Lok Yung Michael and another</span> [2015] 4 SLR 69 at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Rudhra</span><span class="font-italic"> Minerals Pte Ltd </span>at [26]). Despite the uncertainties with the Second Set of Terms, the plaintiff has not pleaded, or proved, any mechanism to resolve them. I should add that by claiming the <span class="font-italic">minimum</span> of 60% of the Company’s shares and 60% of the Property, the plaintiff seems to be seeking to skirt the problems. Even if this may resolve the deficiency in relation to the shares, the other issues as regards the properties remain.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 To conclude, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove the Alleged Oral Agreement’s existence, and I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim based on the Alleged Oral Agreement.
