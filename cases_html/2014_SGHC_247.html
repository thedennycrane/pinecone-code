        Tan Siong Thye J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Ten Leu Jiun Jeanne-Marie, was a
                    Masters of Arts (Architecture) (“the MA degree”) candidate at the
                    National University of Singapore’s (“the defendant”) School
                    of Design and Environment. The crux of her complaint was that the defendant
                    refused to award her the MA degree despite her meeting the academic
                    requirements. As a result, the plaintiff sued the defendant for loss and damage.
                    She alleged that the defendant had wrongly terminated her candidature and her
                    claim was grounded in the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     breach of
                    contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     the tort
                        of misfeasance in public office;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     the tort of intimidation; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     the tort of negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In the course of the proceedings, the plaintiff
                    lodged a discovery application, Summons No 3299 of 2013 (“SUM
                    3299”), against the defendant for a large number of documents. The
                    interlocutory application was heard by the Assistant Registrar
                    (“AR”) who dismissed it. The plaintiff was dissatisfied with the
                    AR’s decision and appealed against it. I dismissed the plaintiff’s
                    appeal, Registrar’s Appeal No 320 of 2013 (“RA 320”), and
                    also dismissed her application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal,
                    Summons No 5875 of 2013 (“SUM 5875”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Subsequently, in Originating Summons No 699 of
                    2014 (“OS 699”), the plaintiff applied for my written grounds for
                    RA 320 and SUM 5875. I dismissed her application as the parties were fully aware
                    of the arguments. I had orally explained my decision to the parties in the
                    course of their submissions in both RA 320 and SUM 5875 although these were not
                    reflected in my notes. Nevertheless, she insisted on having my written grounds.
                    Now, dissatisfied with my decision in OS 699, she seeks to appeal against
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I shall first summarise the events leading up to
                    OS 699, because they are important for a full appreciation of this case, before
                    addressing the main issue at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RA 320</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       RA 320 was an appeal by the plaintiff against
                    the order of the AR who disallowed her discovery application for many documents.
                    The AR had released his written grounds of decision to explain why he refused to
                    allow the plaintiff to have access to those documents. His reason was that she
                    had not satisfied the threshold of relevance and necessity. At the appeal, I
                    reminded the parties during oral submissions that it was trite law that the test
                    for the discovery of documents was for the plaintiff to show relevance and
                    necessity. This test depended on the issues and pleadings of the case. In the
                    circumstances, I ruled that the plaintiff had not satisfied this test. This was
                    explained to the parties although it was not recorded in my written
                    notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">SUM 5875</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff was dissatisfied with my decision
                    to dismiss her appeal in RA 320. Accordingly she sought leave to appeal to the
                    Court of Appeal in SUM 5875.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before the parties began their submissions, the
                    plaintiff’s counsel made a preliminary application for her to be present
                    at the hearing. The defendant’s counsel strenuously objected to the
                    application as in normal practice, chamber proceedings were conducted in the
                    absence of the parties’ respective clients. The plaintiff’s counsel
                    did not provide any compelling reason that warranted a deviation from the norm.
                    Nevertheless, I allowed the plaintiff to be present. This was for two reasons.
                    First, I realised that the plaintiff had taken a very keen personal interest in
                    the case and in the interest of transparency, I allowed her to be present.
                    Second, she would be given a first-hand opportunity to observe and hear the
                    arguments presented to the court. This would perhaps give her a better
                    understanding of the court’s decision and the reasons the court decided in
                    a particular manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In deciding whether to grant her leave to
                    appeal, I considered the following three criteria (see <em>Lee
                        Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 at
                    [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether there was a <em>prima facie</em> factual error made;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether there was a question of general
                        principle to be decided for the first time; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether there was a question of importance on
                        which the public interest would be served by having further arguments
                        presented and a decision rendered by a higher tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff’s case failed to satisfy any
                    of the three criteria. Accordingly, I did not grant leave to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s request for my written grounds</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff wrote in to the Supreme Court
                    Registry (“the Registry”) on 31 December 2013 to request my
                    written grounds of decision for RA 320 and SUM 5875. Subsequently, the Registry
                    replied on 23 April 2014 that there was “no need for Grounds of Decision
                    for this case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s complaint to the Chief Justice and V K Rajah
                JA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 22 April 2014 the plaintiff then sent an
                    email to the Chief Justice. The contents of the email are set out as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Honourable Chief Justice Menon,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am the Plaintiff in Suit No. 667/2012/W.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is with great reluctance that I write this letter to you. However I do
                        not know what else I could do. I believe that Judicial Commissioner Tan
                        Siong Thye did not give me a fair hearing on 15 January 2014. This hearing
                        was for my application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against
                        the Judicial Commissioner’s decision, following a hearing on 5
                        November 2013, to dismiss my appeal against an Assistant Registrar’s
                        decision to deny my application for discovery in my lawsuit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The hearing for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on 15 January 2014
                        was not a fair hearing because the Judicial Commissioner did not provide me
                        with the reasons for his decision in the appeal hearing on 5 November 2013.
                        Without knowing these reasons, my lawyer could not properly prepare
                        arguments for the application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on
                        15 January 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My lawyers have formally requested for Judicial Commissioner Tan Siong
                        Thye’s reasons for his Grounds of Decision on the hearing on 5
                        November 2013 at least three times, both in writing (three letters to the
                        Court) and orally during Pre-Trial Conferences, but the Judicial
                        Commissioner has still not provided his reasons as of today, over five
                        months after the hearing last November. The last two letters also contained
                        requests for the Grounds of Decision of the 15 January 2014 hearing.
                        However, I have not received the Grounds of Decision of either hearing so
                        far.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even if Judicial Commissioner Tan Siong Thye does provide his reasons
                        someday, it will not change the fact that the hearing for my application for
                        leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on 15 January 2014 was not a fair
                        hearing, since I did not have the benefit of knowing the Judicial
                        Commissioner’s reasons regarding my hearing on 5 November 2013, when
                        he turned down my appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s
                        decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I believe that Judicial Commissioner Tan Siong Thye’s failure to
                        provide reasons for his decision regarding my hearing on 5 November 2013 is
                        contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Thong
                            Ah Fat v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] SGCA 65. In this decision,
                        the Court of Appeal ruled (at [14]) that judges have a “<em>crucial judicial duty to give reasons</em>” and
                        that this duty “<em>prevails in both civil and
                            criminal cases</em>.” The Court of Appeal also stated (at
                        [22]) that: “<em>The duty ordinarily applies even
                            where there can be no appeal against that decision.</em>”
                        The Court of Appeal stressed that the judicial duty to state reasons applies
                        even to decisions for which there is no possibility of appeal, stating (at
                        [44]) that: “<em>… The need for justice to be
                            done and seen to be done should not be dampened by the absence of an
                            avenue for appeal. On the contrary, the inability to alter the decision
                            may make it all the more compelling for the parties to understand how it
                            was reached …</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the Court of Appeal in <em>Thong Ah Fat</em>
                        acknowledged that there are exceptions to the judicial duty to provide
                        reasons for decisions (at [32]-[33] and [45]), these exceptions (as defined
                        by the Court of Appeal) clearly do not apply in my case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In addition to not giving me a fair hearing on 15 January 2014, I believe
                        that Judicial Commissioner Tan Siong Thye’s failure to provide reasons
                        for his decision regarding my hearing on 5 November 2013 also violated my
                        Constitutional rights under Article 12 of the Constitution, which says that
                            “<em>All persons are equal before the law and
                            entitled to the equal protection of the law.</em>” If all
                        persons are “equal before the law,” then I should enjoy the
                        benefit of being informed about the reasons for the judge’s decisions,
                        just like other plaintiffs. I know that other plaintiffs have had the
                        benefit of being informed about the reasons for decisions of the High Court
                        regarding appeals against decisions of Assistant Registrars regarding
                        applications for discovery. Two recent examples are: <em>Elbow Holdings Pte Ltd v Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd</em> [2014]
                        SGHC 26 and <em>Koh Chong Chiah and others v Treasure Resort
                            Pte Ltd and another</em> [2014] SGHC 51. In both of those cases,
                        an Assistant Registrar made a decision regarding an application for
                        discovery; in both cases, the decision was appealed to the High Court; and
                        in both cases, the High Court judge provided written grounds of decision. I
                        do not see why the Court should treat me unequally to the plaintiffs in
                        those cases, who were informed about the Court’s reasons for its
                        decisions in their appeals against Assistant Registrars’ decisions
                        concerning their applications for discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My lawyer has advised me that: “<em>(1) there is no
                            further appeal to the Court of Appeal possible from the dismissal of
                            your application for specific discovery, (2) there is no further appeal
                            possible to the Court of Appeal from the refusal to grant you leave to
                            appeal to the Court of Appeal against the dismissal of your application
                            for specific discovery, and (3) there is no possible application to the
                            Court of Appeal for leave to appeal to it against the dismissal of your
                            application for specific discovery.</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My lawyer has also advised me that: “<em>I can
                            confirm that Tan Siong Thye JC’s refusal to grant you leave to
                            appeal to the Court of Appeal from the dismissal of your specific
                            discovery application is final. There is no further application to the
                            Court of Appeal for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal possible, and
                            there is no further right to appeal to the Court of Appeal against this
                            refusal. This follows clearly from sections 34 (1), (2), and (2B) of the
                            Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322, 2007 Rev.
                        Ed.)</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since my lawyer has told me that there is nothing else that I can do, I
                        have decided to write directly to Your Honour. I would like to highlight to
                        Your Honour that I am writing this letter of my own volition since my lawyer
                        has told me that there are no further applications to the Court to appeal to
                        the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public Prosecutor</em>, the
                        Court of Appeal stated at [47] that it did not think that “the
                        judicial duty to state reasons has been satisfied in the present
                        case” and ordered a retrial. Similarly, I believe that there should
                        be a new hearing in my case. If there is indeed a new hearing, I
                        respectfully request this hearing be heard before a different High Court
                        judge (not Judicial Commissioner Tan Siong Thye).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If there is some procedure that I (or my lawyer) should follow in order to
                        request that the Court consider my application for a new hearing, I would be
                        very grateful if Your Honour would let me know what this procedure is, since
                        my lawyer has already told me that there is nothing that I can do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you very much for your kind consideration of the issues.</p>

                    to the Chief Justice, which enclosed a copy of the email cited
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 8 May 2014, the plaintiff sent an email to
                    V K Rajah JA as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Honourable Justice V K Rajah,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Congratulations on your appointment as Attorney-General. I’m sure
                        that you will be an excellent Attorney-General, although I am going to miss
                        your well-reasoned judgments delivered from the bench, such as your landmark
                        decision in <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public
                        Prosecutor</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is in relation to <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public
                            Prosecutor</em> that I write to you now. I am the Plaintiff in
                        Suit 667/2012. I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to obtain Judicial
                        Commissioner Tan Siong Thye’s Grounds of Decisions related to my
                        application in Specific Discovery. My lawyers made three requests for these
                        Grounds of Decisions, and specifically reminded the Registrar about the
                        judicial duty to provide reasoned judgments in <em>Thong Ah
                            Fat v Public Prosecutor</em>, only to have the Court’s Lee
                        Kwee Ngor respond finally that “there is no need for Grounds of
                        Decision for this case.” Isn’t this response contrary to your
                        reasoning regarding the judicial duty to provide reasoned judgments in
                            <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public Prosecutor</em>?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Judicial Commissioner Tan Siong Thye first rejected my appeal against an
                        Assistant Registrar’s decision, and then rejected my application for
                        leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. I feel that I was not given a fair
                        hearing for my application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, since
                        I did not know then (and still don’t know today) what the Judicial
                        Commissioner’s reasons were for rejecting my appeal against the
                        Assistant Registrar’s decision. The Court has provided me with the
                        Notes of Evidence, but the Notes of Evidence do not show the Judicial
                        Commissioner’s reasons for his decisions in my case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To prevent any misunderstandings, I must explain that I have already
                        written to Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon on 22 and 28 April 2014 regarding
                        the issue of not being given the Grounds of Decisions. This was after my
                        lawyer told me that there was nothing more that he could do. I have received
                        an acknowledgement from the Supreme Court’s Quality Service Manager Ms
                        Lee May Lin stating that the matters I have raised are being looked into. I
                        am awaiting a substantive response. I thought that I should write to you as
                        well, since you delivered the judgment of the Court in <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public Prosecutor</em>, and since I do not know
                        when I will receive a substantive response from the Court – I am
                        afraid that you might leave the bench before that happens.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I append my letter to the Chief Justice regarding this issue.</p>

                    the plaintiff as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Ms Ten,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We refer to your email and letter dated 22 April 2014 and 28 April 2014 to
                        the Honourable Chief Justice as well as your email dated 8 May 2014 to the
                        Honourable Judge of Appeal Justice VK Rajah, the contents of all have been
                        noted by the respective addressees. The Honourable Chief Justice has
                        reviewed the matter and has requested me to respond to you on his
                        behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    
              <em>We note that the reasons behind
                                the dismissal of your original application (SUM 3299/2013) before
                                Assistant Registrar Shaun Leong have been explained in
                                writing.</em> On appeal, your solicitors would have been fully
                            aware of the need to make out a case to rebut the grounds articulated by
                            the Assistant Registrar. The governing legal principle for your
                            interlocutory application requesting the discovery of the documents that
                            you sought is that of necessity and relevance. <em>The
                                Assistant Registrar explained that you had not satisfied this
                                threshold. In your appeal before JC Tan, he had reiterated the same
                                legal principle to your counsel and the counsel for NUS.</em>
                            Both counsel addressed the issue and in the final analysis it was
                            evident that your counsel had not persuaded JC Tan that the decision of
                            the Assistant Registrar should not be upheld. Accordingly, your appeal
                            was dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Before the commencement of the hearing of your
                            application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, <em>your counsel applied to JC Tan to allow you to be
                                present</em>. As you might be aware, parties who are legally
                            represented are not generally allowed to be present at hearings in
                            chambers. Indeed, this was why an application for leave had to be made
                            and the counsel for NUS strenuously objected to the application.
                                <em>Nevertheless, JC Tan allowed you to be present so
                                that you could listen to the arguments presented by both counsel.
                                Thus you were able to appreciate the outcome of your application
                                although the decision was not in your
                        favour.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    We are therefore satisfied that due process has been
                            observed and the applications have been decided in accordance with the
                            law. Your solicitors have already advised you on your legal position on
                            this issue. As such, in accordance with the provisions of the Supreme
                            Court Judicature Act, we regret that we are unable to accede to your
                            request for a new hearing.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">OS 699</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff was dissatisfied with the reply
                    and she took out OS 699 with the following application:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Written Grounds of Decision shall be provided in respect of interlocutory
                        hearings before this Honourable Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s preliminary application for the presiding judge
                to recuse himself</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 29 September 2014, before the substantive
                    hearing of OS 699, the plaintiff’s counsel made a preliminary objection to
                    my hearing of the application and asked that I recuse myself from hearing the
                    matter. I dismissed the application. The plaintiff’s counsel then applied
                    for an adjournment to ascertain whether the plaintiff could appeal against this
                    ruling. I granted the adjournment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Parties appeared before me on 20 October 2014.
                    The plaintiff’s counsel sought a further adjournment so as to take
                    instructions from the plaintiff on whether to seek leave to appeal against my
                    decision not to recuse myself. I granted this adjournment too. Parties next
                    appeared before me on 27 October 2014. At the hearing, the plaintiff’s
                    counsel informed me that the plaintiff was not seeking leave to appeal against
                    my decision not to recuse myself. However, in a letter sent by the
                    plaintiff’s counsel to the Supreme Court on 24 October 2014, the
                    plaintiff’s position was stated as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [the plaintiff’s] agreement to proceed with the OS hearing
                        must not be construed to imply that she had not abandoned her original
                        objections to Justice Tan Siong Thye’s hearing of this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At the hearing on 27 October 2014, the
                    plaintiff’s counsel applied for her to be present although her counsel had
                    advised her that this was not the usual practice. The defendant objected as she
                    had not provided any reason for this application. Again, I allowed her to be
                    present.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In OS 699, the plaintiff sought written
                    grounds for RA 320 and SUM 5875. She cited extensive portions of <em>Thong Ah Fat v Public Prosecutor</em> [2012] 1 SLR 676
                        (“<em>Thong Ah Fat</em>”) to support her
                    application for written grounds. One of the many references that the plaintiff
                    made to this case was from paragraph 14 of the judgment, which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    We emphasise that this crucial judicial duty to
                            give reasons prevails in both civil and criminal cases. Although this
                            duty is not expressly stated under the Criminal Procedure Code 2010
                            … it is a duty which is inherent in our common law
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Having highlighted this judicial duty to give
                    reasons, the plaintiff made four submissions. First, she submitted that the
                    failure to provide written judgments for RA 320 and SUM 5875 was a violation of
                    Art 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed,
                    1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”). Her argument was that as
                    other plaintiffs had been given written grounds, she too should be given written
                        grounds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In support of her submission, she cited
                        <em>Elbow Holdings Pte Ltd v Marina Bay Sands Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2014] SGHC 26 and <em>Koh Chong Chian and
                        others v Treasure Resort Pte Ltd and another</em> [2014] SGHC 51 as
                    instances in which the High Court furnished written grounds with respect to
                    appeals against decisions of ARs in relation to discovery
                        applications.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On the basis of those cases, the
                    plaintiff sought my written judgments for RA 320 and SUM 5875.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Second, the plaintiff submitted that because
                    there was no written judgment for RA 320, she was unable to make proper
                    submissions for her leave application in SUM 5875.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Thus, she
                    was deprived of a fair hearing and her interests were prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Third, the plaintiff submitted that written
                    grounds would be beneficial to the local jurisprudence as they would create more
                    consistency in judicial decisions and provide both counsel and litigants with
                    the benefit of the court’s reasoning.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Fourth, the plaintiff submitted that written
                    judgments would save the court’s time and resources as retrials would be
                    avoided. In support of her submission, she pointed to <em>Thong
                        Ah Fat</em> as an example where the Court of Appeal had ordered a
                    retrial on the basis of inadequate reasoning in the written judgment of the
                    trial judge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant’s counsel made very brief
                    oral submissions. First, he submitted that the court had the discretion to
                    decide whether to issue written grounds. For this, he relied on <em>Thong Ah Fat</em>. Second, he noted that even the Court of
                    Appeal did not issue written grounds in every case. Third, he argued that the
                    plaintiff had suffered no prejudice, as neither the defendant nor the plaintiff
                    had the benefit of any written grounds. Moreover, the plaintiff was represented
                    by counsel in all her applications and her counsel must have been familiar with
                    the issues and arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should I recuse myself from hearing OS 699?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I shall first deal with the plaintiff’s
                    preliminary application for me to recuse myself from hearing of OS 699. The
                    basis for this application was that I had disallowed her two previous
                    applications, namely RA 320 and SUM 5875. She further alleged in the letter
                    dated 24 October 2014 sent by her counsel to the Supreme Court Registry that I
                    was “clearly tainted by apparent bias” and that if I proceeded to
                    hear OS 699 it would be a violation of natural justice as it was a case that was
                    essentially a complaint against the judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the recent case of <em>Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal Singh and another v Attorney-General</em>
                    [2013] 2 SLR 1108 (“<em>Manjit</em>”), the
                    applicants similarly applied for the judge to recuse himself on grounds of
                    apparent bias. The judge declined to recuse himself because he found no
                    circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension in a
                    fair-minded person with knowledge of the relevant facts that he, the decision
                    maker, was biased (citing, and applying, the test laid out in <em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 85 at [91]).
                    He noted, at [34], a few principles on recusal which are of relevance to this
                    case, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     An application to a judge to recuse
                        himself must be based on credible grounds (citing <em>Yong
                            Vui Kong v Attorney-General</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1189 at
                        [148]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     A claim
                        that there is apparent bias on the part of a judge must be based on facts
                        that are substantially true and accurate. The fact that an allegation of
                        bias has been made against a judge is not enough; otherwise, a party could
                        secure a judge of his choice by merely alleging bias on the part of other
                        judges (citing <em>Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew</em>
                        [1997] 3 SLR(R) 576 at [51]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     In determining the application, the judge must have
                        regard to the quality of the allegation. A judge would be as wrong as to
                        yield to a tenuous or frivolous objection as he would to ignore an objection
                        of substance (citing <em>Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield
                            Properties Ltd</em> [2000] QB 451 at [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In this case, the plaintiff’s
                    application for me to recuse myself was not based on any credible grounds, and
                    was frivolous. This applied equally to her allegations of apparent bias and
                    natural justice. In fact, it would have been inappropriate for any other judge
                    to have dealt with this application, OS 699. This was because OS 699 was an
                    application specifically demanding that I issue written judgments for RA 320 and
                    SUM 5875. Therefore it was incumbent on me to hear this application because the
                    plaintiff was insistent that the judge who heard her previous applications write
                    the judgments. Applying the principles laid out in <em>Manjit</em>, I therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s application
                    for me to recuse myself. With this, I turn now to address the plaintiff’s
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the failure to provide the plaintiff with written grounds violate
                Article 12 of the Constitution?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the proceedings, the plaintiff first
                    submitted that Art 12 of the Constitution was the provision on equality before
                    the law. Her case was that Art 12 was violated when I failed to provide my
                    written grounds to her with respect to RA 320 and SUM 5878. Specifically, she
                    relied on Art 12(1) which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>12.</b>—(1) All persons are equal before
                        the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I disagreed with the plaintiff’s
                    interpretation of Art 12. The objective of Art 12 was made clear in <em>Public Prosecutor v Taw Cheng Kong</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R)
                    489 (at [54], citing <em>Ong Ah Chuan and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1979–1980] SLR(R) 710) where it was held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Equality before the law and equal protection of the law require that like
                        should be compared with like. <em>What Art 12(1) of the
                            Constitution assures to the individual is the right to equal treatment
                            with other individuals in similar circumstances.</em> It prohibits
                        laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be
                        treated by way of punishment more harshly than others … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The issue of whether a person is unequally
                    treated under the law was ventilated before the Court of Appeal in <em>Eng Foong Ho and others v Attorney-General</em> [2009] 2
                    SLR(R) 542 (“<em>Eng Foong Ho</em>”). The
                    salient facts of that case are as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Eng Foong Ho</em>,
                    the Government invoked its powers under the Land Acquisition Act (Cap 152, 1985
                    Rev Ed) to acquire land belonging to the Jin Long Si Temple (“the
                    Temple”). Next to the temple stood the Ramakrishna Mission (“the
                    Mission”) and the Bartley Christian Church (“the Church”).
                    The appellants were temple devotees and they brought an action on the basis of
                    Art 12(1), claiming that they had been unfairly treated since the
                    Temple’s land had been acquired but neither the Mission nor the
                    Church’s land had been acquired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The appellant’s case in <em>Eng Foong Ho</em> was similar to this case. In that case, the
                    Mission, the Church and the Temple belonged to the same class as they were
                    religious institutions located in a predominantly residential area in close
                    proximity to the Bartley MRT station. However, only the Temple’s land had
                    been acquired. Furthermore, the Mission and the Church would have derived
                    benefit from having a proximate MRT station. Therefore, it was argued that the
                    Government had treated the Temple unequally (at [23]–[24]). The
                    Temple’s action was dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In this case, the plaintiff was afforded the
                    opportunity to attend the chamber hearings. However, she could not show that she
                    had any normative right or an entitlement to a <em>written</em> decision by the court. In her submissions, she could not
                    show anywhere in the Constitution, the rules of natural justice or the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) that judges have a duty to deliver <em>written</em> grounds in <em>every</em>
                    case and that litigants correspondingly have a legal right in every case to
                        <em>written</em> grounds. The premise of her claim was
                    based on a specious comparison with other decisions in which other judges had
                    delivered written decisions to the parties. Her argument was grounded on
                    consequential reasoning and could not give rise to any <em>normative</em> right to written decisions by the court. I hence
                    dismissed her first submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the plaintiff prejudiced in her preparation for SUM
                5875?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Second, the plaintiff alleged that she was
                    prejudiced because she had not been given written grounds in RA 320. As a
                    result, she was unable to adequately prepare for SUM 5875. I did not agree, as
                    her claim was not supported by the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The plaintiff was represented by the same law
                    firm, Peter Low LLC, in all the proceedings relating to her discovery
                    application, namely, SUM 3299, RA 320, and SUM 5875. Her counsel in RA 320 must
                    have known of the reasons her appeal against the AR’s decision was
                    dismissed. This was because her counsel argued the appeal, as well as the
                    application before the AR. He must have explained to her the reasons she was
                    unsuccessful at both hearings. Later, the same counsel represented her in SUM
                    5875 when she applied for leave to appeal. In the lead up to each application or
                    appeal, her counsel would have had to apprise her of all the arguments that took
                    place in the previous proceedings, as well as why each court arrived at its
                    ultimate decision. Therefore, I did not see how the plaintiff would have been
                    prejudiced due to the lack of written grounds for RA 320.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In any event, it was evident from the
                    plaintiff’s written submissions for SUM 5875 that she was aware of the
                    relevant issues for the purpose of the application for leave to the Court of
                    Appeal. The submissions were comprehensive and apposite. All the material issues
                    were addressed and there was no hint that she was prejudiced in any way. In the
                    circumstances, I found that she was not prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Would written grounds benefit the local jurisprudence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Third, the plaintiff submitted that written
                    judgments would enrich the local jurisprudence. In my view, although written
                    judgments generally benefit the local jurisprudence, it is the quality and not
                    quantity of the written judgments that ultimately matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In this case, I observed that the plaintiff
                    was motivated more by the fact that she had not been given written judgments for
                    RA 320 and SUM 5875 and her insistence that these be given as of right. Her
                    interest in enriching the local jurisprudence was furthest away from her
                    consideration in bringing this OS. Even if that were her primary motivation, the
                    discovery proceedings involved largely routine matters that turned primarily on
                    the facts. There were no unique points of law. Any contribution to the local
                    jurisprudence would have been of minimal significance. Consequently, this
                    submission also failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Would the issuing of written grounds save judicial time and
                resources?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiff’s last submission was that
                    time and resources would be saved if written grounds were issued. She relied on
                        <em>Thong Ah Fat</em>, where the Court of Appeal
                    directed a retrial of an accused facing a capital charge as it found the written
                    judgment of the trial judge lacking in material consideration. In my view, the
                    facts of <em>Thong Ah Fat</em> were materially different
                    from this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>Thong Ah Fat</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal dealt with the final order of the trial judge, namely, he
                    found the accused guilty and sentenced him to death. The fact-finding process of
                    the trial judge was important to the Court of Appeal for it to understand and
                    appreciate how the trial judge arrived at his finding of guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In contrast, the plaintiff’s case
                    concerned an interlocutory application for the discovery of documents. The AR
                    had already applied the test of relevance and necessity and adequately explained
                    why the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the threshold test. As I agreed with the
                    AR’s decision, I dismissed RA 320. Hence there was no justification for a
                    rehearing of this case as stated in the Supreme Court’s reply to the
                    plaintiff dated 21 May 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The plaintiff was thus misconceived that there
                    would be a saving of time and resources if I released my written grounds for RA
                    320 and SUM 5875. In fact, time and resources could have been saved had the
                    plaintiff and her counsel not brought the present application, as there would
                    then have been no necessity to deliver this written judgement as this case was
                    unmeritorious. Therefore the plaintiff’s last submission also
                    failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should I issue my written grounds in this case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Having dealt with the points raised in the
                    plaintiff’s submissions, I shall now address the situations in which a
                    judge should release his written grounds and when written grounds are not
                    necessary. <em>Thong Ah Fat</em> is instructive in this
                    regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The starting point is that a judge should
                    always give the reasons for his decision. This can be done either orally or in
                    writing. As the Court of Appeal in <em>Thong Ah Fat</em>
                    noted, judges must appreciate that they are judicially accountable for their
                    decisions and it is important that justice must not only be done but seen to be
                    done. This was expressed by the Court of Appeal (at [24]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Judicial accountability is associated with the
                            notion of open justice. Hence, another foundation of the duty to give
                            reasons is the principle that <em>justice must not only
                                be done but it must be seen to be done</em>: see [<em>Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR
                                247]</em> at 278 (<em>per</em> McHugh
                            JA). Where the reasons for an adverse ruling are not revealed, the
                            litigant may think that the judge has not really understood his case,
                            and the public may form the same opinion. The withholding of reasons may
                            therefore affect the legitimacy of the decision. In our view, <em>the requirement to give reasons beneficially increases the
                                transparency of the judicial system</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     With this starting point in mind, I now
                    revisit the key facets of the proceedings relating to RA 320, and consider
                    whether written grounds were necessary for that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Why was the plaintiff allowed to be present at SUM 5875 and OS
                699?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I am conscious of the notion that justice must
                    not only be done but must be seen to be done. It was for this reason that I
                    allowed the plaintiff to be present at SUM 5875 and OS 699 even though the
                    general practice for chamber hearings was that they were conducted in the
                    presence of counsel only but not the parties themselves, unless there are good
                    reasons for the parties to be present. Both the plaintiff’s counsel in SUM
                    5875, from Peter Low LLC, and her present counsel, from L F Violet Netto, knew
                    of this practice. That was why both her counsel in the two different chamber
                    hearings had to seek the court’s permission to allow her to be present.
                    Despite the defendant’s counsel’s objection to her presence on both
                    occasions and her failure to provide good reasons for wanting to be present, I
                    allowed her to be present during OS 699 and for the same reasons I allowed her
                    to be present at SUM 5875 (see above at [7]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The plaintiff’s first application to be
                    present was made in SUM 5875 when she sought leave to appeal against my decision
                    in RA 320. The second was in OS 699, where she applied for my written grounds in
                    RA 320 and SUM 5875. When I allowed her to be present at both proceedings, it
                    was for several reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     First, it is my view that justice must be
                    transparent. That cause would have been served by her presence at the
                    proceedings as she was deeply interested in her case. Disallowing her presence
                    might have given her the impression that justice was only done behind closed
                    doors. She might have thought that her interests were not being well advanced in
                    the best possible way. She might also have been susceptible to all sorts of
                    negative impressions of the justice system should the decision be adverse to
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Second, justice must not only be done but must
                    be seen to be done. This could not have been achieved had I denied her
                    application to be present at the chamber hearings. Had I done so, she would not
                    have been able to see how counsel delivered their arguments or how the court
                    arrived at its decision. Furthermore, if the proceedings yielded a result that
                    was not in her favour, she may have been even more disgruntled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Third, I wanted her to listen to the arguments
                    of counsel, my oral interventions, as well as my oral reasons which
                    unfortunately I had not fully recorded in my notes. Despite the above, she was
                    still dissatisfied and demanded that I provide my written
                judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Are written judgments necessary in every instance?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Written judgments are not necessary in every
                    instance. In fact, requiring written grounds in every case would be impractical.
                    This was observed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Thong Ah
                        Fat</em> (at [29]–[30] and [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    This requirement to set out reasons may increase
                            costs and result in delays. Such consequences are a real concern. The
                            Supreme Court of Canada noted in <em>MacDonald v The
                                Queen</em> (1976) 29 CCC (2d) 257 at 262-263 that “the
                            volume of criminal work makes an indiscriminate requirement of reasons
                            impractical”. It would indeed be undesirable if considerations of
                            form rather than of substance required unnecessary time to be spent in
                            writing rather than in judging. Similarly, the Australian courts, which
                            have imposed such a general duty, are aware of these concerns militating
                            against it. Even while upholding the duty, they recognise the heavy
                            court load and the constraints faced by first instance judges
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    We think that the correct response to these
                            concerns is to have a standard of explanation <em>which
                                corresponds to the requirements of the case</em> rather than
                            to reject the duty totally. The key is to strike an appropriate balance.
                            While such anxieties do not warrant outright rejection of the duty
                            altogether, they have been taken into account quite rightly in
                            dispensing with reasons in certain cases and matters … in
                            accepting the appropriateness of abbreviated oral reasons in some
                            situations, and in adjusting the level of detail required of the
                            statement of reasons to suit the circumstances in other
                        cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    … we recognise that the duty to give reasons
                            may increase costs and result in delays, and that judges are often
                            expected to manage a heavy court list on a daily basis (see above at
                            [29]). The extent of the duty to provide reasons must therefore always
                            be tempered with the need to ensure that judicial time is used
                            effectively and efficiently. This would entail achieving a balanced mix
                            of time spent by a judge in hearings and in preparing reasons for his or
                            her decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Court of Appeal in <em>Thong Ah Fat</em> explained that the duty to give reasons should not

                            we would echo Kirby P's pertinent reminder in <em>[Waterson v Batten (13 May 1988) (New South Wales Court of
                                Appeal)]</em> that under the pressure of today’s court
                            lists, there is no time for fastidious precision in the drafting of
                            reasons. He quite rightly cautioned against treating a judgment
                            “as if its language had been honed in countless hours of
                            reflection and revision”, emphasising that a “<em>practical standard</em> must be adopted”
                            [emphasis added]. Similarly, Nygh J in <em>In the

                                Jane Towns Respondent/Wife</em> [1990] FamCA 129 stated that

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">[the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia] has, on

                                sitting in busy lists and have to deliver their judgments on an
                                extemporary basis which may not make it possible for them to express
                                themselves with the directness and clarity that an appellate
                                tribunal and litigants might wish.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    Additionally, there
                            are exceptions to this duty to provide reasons. Thus, in certain
                            instances, a judge may not be in error when he fails to state reasons.
                            In <em>Sun Alliance Insurance Ltd v Massoud</em>
                            [1989] VR 8 (“<em>Sun
                            Alliance</em>”), Gray J pragmatically stated that (at
                            19):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">The simplicity of the context of the case or the state of the
                                evidence may be such that a mere statement of the judge's conclusion
                                will sufficiently indicate the basis of a decision ... In such
                                cases, the foundation for the judge’s conclusion will be
                                indicated as a matter of necessary inference.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">The same was stated in <em>Brittingham v
                                    Williams</em> [1932] VLR 237 at 239 and [<em>Public Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond (1986)
                                    63 ALR 559]</em> at 566. But this approach must be
                                confined to very clear cases and in relation to specific and
                                straightforward factual or legal issues. Otherwise, the exceptions
                                would seriously undermine the duty to give reasons.</p>

                                mainly those with a procedural focus, which a judge can properly
                                make an order without giving reasons</em>: see <em>Capital and Suburban Properties Ltd v Swycher</em>
                            [1976] Ch 319 at 325-326 (<em>per</em> Buckley LJ)
                            and <em>Knight v Clifton</em> [1971] Ch 700 at 721.
                                <em>Buckley LJ had in mind instances where the judge

                                granted or refused. Neither are reasons normally to be expected when
                                a judge exercises his discretion on costs, unless it involves an

                                v Pigott-Brown</em> [1985] 3 All ER 119 at 122. It appears
                            that many of these exceptions involve a large element of discretion.
                            However, we do not think that it is their discretionary nature <em>per se</em> which justifies the dispensation of any
                            explanation. <b><em>Rather, it seems that these exceptions

                                procedure, where the decision will effectively decide the rights of
                                the parties finally, reasons must be given</em></b>: see <em>Glen Rees T/as Glynmar Pastoral Co v Walker</em> (13
                            December 1988) (New South Wales Court of Appeal) (<em>per</em> Kirby P). However, we would caution against equating
                            non-substantive cases as being necessarily insignificant. The court's
                            assessment of the significance of a decision should take into account
                            the circumstances of the case, and its importance should not be judged
                            simply by categorising the decision as being substantive or procedural
                            in nature. As a rule of thumb, <em>the more profound the
                                consequences of a decision are, the greater the necessity for

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Two salient points can be noted from the
                    preceding passage. First, although there is a general duty to give reasons for a
                    decision, this duty does not extend to all cases especially the less significant
                    ones. Second, the duty to give reasons does not equate to a duty to provide
                        <em>written decisions</em>. The position at law is that
                    when it is necessary or appropriate for the court to issue written grounds, it
                    is the duty of the court to provide them, notwithstanding the pressures of time
                    and resources or any administrative constraints. It may be necessary and
                    appropriate to issue written grounds where any of the following are
                    involved:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     complex issues of fact or
                        law;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     matters of
                        public importance; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     the laying down of principles that are to be followed in
                        subsequent cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The present case involved none of these. Let
                    me elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Why were written grounds unnecessary in RA 320?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I note that although the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Thong Ah Fat</em> commented on the duty of an
                    appellate court to provide reasons for its decision, it also advised that if the
                    appellate court affirms the decision of the lower court and agrees with the
                    lower court’s reasons, it is not obliged to reprise the reasons (at
                    [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ordinarily, for an appellate court, it would be sufficient (when it is
                        satisfied with the outcome and adequacy of the reasoning of the lower court)
                        to simply state in affirming the earlier decision that it agrees with the
                        reasons given in support of it. It is not obliged to reprise the reasons or
                        give additional ones in a fresh judgment if it forms the view that this is
                        not necessary. This must be a matter of judgment for the appellate
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This observation is particularly pertinent as
                    I heard the plaintiff’s appeal against the decision of the AR in RA 320 in
                    my appellate capacity. At the court below, the AR had issued his written grounds
                    of decision explaining why the plaintiff had not satisfied the threshold of the
                    test of relevance and necessity. It is trite that, unless privilege which is
                    protected from discovery is alleged, relevance and necessity are the operative
                    considerations in deciding whether discovery should be allowed. The satisfaction
                    of these considerations is dependent on the issues in each case, which are in
                    turn dependent on the pleadings of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Turning to RA 320, I had agreed fully with the
                    AR’s written grounds of decision. There were no complicated or novel
                    points of law. Neither were there any issues of public interest or anything else
                    that suggested that written grounds were warranted. It was a fact-finding
                    exercise and the plaintiff was ably represented by her counsel, who would have
                    undoubtedly explained to her why her appeal was disallowed. Furthermore, she was
                    allowed to observe the proceedings in chambers despite not having provided any
                    good reasons. For those reasons, I found that issuing written grounds was
                    unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Why were written grounds unnecessary in SUM 5875?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In SUM 5875, the plaintiff applied for leave
                    to appeal to the Court of Appeal against my decision in RA 320. She was
                    represented by the same counsel who represented her in SUM 3299 and RA 320.
                    Also, she was allowed to be present during the proceedings. There was thus no
                    reason why she would not have known of the reasons for my
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In any event, the plaintiff had to satisfy the
                    court that her case fell within one of the three criteria listed at [8] above.
                    She failed, and I noted that her discovery application which was an
                    interlocutory application had already gone through two levels of judicial
                    consideration. There must be finality to such interlocutory proceedings or the
                    trial would be delayed further. In my view, there were no special reasons for
                    her case to proceed to the Court of Appeal. As such, I denied her
                leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     When I dismissed the plaintiff’s
                    application on 27 October 2014, I made brief remarks which I find appropriate to
                    be set out here:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court agrees with the principles in Thong Ah Fat. Parties should know
                        the reasons for the court’s decision. This can be oral or in writing.
                        It is for this reason that despite the Defendant’s objection to
                        Plaintiff’s presence in these proceedings the court had allowed her to
                        be present on both occasions so that she understands what is going on
                        despite being represented by lawyers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the appeal against the order of [the AR], I have explained to parties
                        that the fundamental consideration is whether these documents sought for
                        were relevant and necessary. Parties knew that this is the pivotal
                        determination for discovery application. I had orally explained to the
                        parties that the Plaintiff had not satisfied this principle. And this was
                        the reason for dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was therefore erroneous for Plaintiff to say that she did not know or
                        that the court had not given any reason for that decision. The reasons were
                        articulated but it was not reflected in the notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is because I believe that parties should know the reasons of the court
                        decisions that I have written more than 25 full judgments for last year.
                        More than 70% of those decisions were voluntarily written even before
                        parties had filed any appeal. The court has to exercise its discretion
                        whether or not to issue written judgment. This will depend on the merits of
                        each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In summary, the plaintiff was aware of the
                    reasons why her application for discovery and the subsequent appeal were
                    dismissed. Throughout the court proceedings, she was ably represented by counsel
                    who must have explained to her why she did not succeed at each stage. This was
                    the case even after she changed her solicitors. For the above reasons, I
