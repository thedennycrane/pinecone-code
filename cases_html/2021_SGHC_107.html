Ng was the LLEW for 13 years from 1999 to 2012. During this time, he made the requisite annual applications for the renewal of the electrical installation licenses for Dawn Shipping.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In the application for renewal, Ng was required to submit a certificate of fitness (“COF”) certifying that the electrical installation was “fit for operation” to the EMA.

In November 1999, Ng signed a SLD reproduced from the previous LLEW’s SLD and submitted it to the EMA. For each renewal application after 1999, he did not submit any “updated” SLDs as no A&amp;A works had been carried out to the electrical installation. However, pursuant to the declarations he made in the COFs, Ng confirmed each year that the SLD endorsed and submitted by him in November 1999 was still valid at the time of each renewal application (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ng Chee Meng </span>[2017] SGMC 35 (the “State Court’s decision”) at [18] to [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 7 December 2012, a fatal electrocution occurred at the electrical installation where the deceased person suffered an electric shock while using a surface mounted switch socket outlet (“SMSSO”) which was not fitted with a residual current circuit breaker (“RCCB”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 For failing to ensure that the SMSSO was fitted with a functional RCCB, Ng was prosecuted for causing hurt to the deceased by a negligent act or omission in respect of an electrical installation under his control under s 83(3) of the Electricity Act (Cap 89A, 2002 Rev Ed). Following a trial, he was convicted on 13 April 2017 and sentenced on 12 May 2017 to a fine of $7,000.00 in default of which he was to serve four weeks’ imprisonment (see the State Court’s decision at [145]). The State Court’s decision was not appealed against by Ng.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Following Ng’s conviction, EMA lodged a complaint against Ng with the respondent, the Professional Engineers Board, Singapore (“PEB”).

</div> Thus, he had not breached the provision since a SLD is a diagram or drawing but not a plan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I rejected this argument. From the literal wording of paragraph 2, the term “professional engineer” did not limit its application only to civil and structural engineers. I was also not persuaded that the SLD cannot be considered a “plan” within the meaning of paragraph 2. Since paragraph 2 governs the conduct of professional engineers in verifying, checking or preparing “any plans or calculations” submitted for the purpose of obtaining “any permit, licence or approval or any public authority”, a broad reading of the word “plan” is warranted to safeguard the trust that authorities place on documents signed by professional engineers. I accept the respondent’s argument that — when read in the light of s 10 of the PEA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the parent legislation), which makes reference to the privilege of professional engineers to “draw or prepare any plan, sketch, drawing, design, specification or other document relating to any of the prescribed branches of professional engineering work”

</div> I did not agree with Ng that his duties were confined to only examination of the switch room. Before signing the declaration that the SLD was still valid at the material time for submission to the EMA for the renewal application, there were other important parts outside the switch room (<span class="font-italic">e</span><span class="font-italic">g</span>, the distribution boards) that he should have inspected. In fact, Ng conceded before me at the hearing that he should have inspected at least the distribution boards. If he had done so, the missing RCCB would have been immediately discovered by him. Since Ng submitted the COF and declared the validity of the SLD to the EMA for the purpose of renewing the electrical installation license for Dawn Shipping but had not verified or checked the validity of the SLD itself, Ng was in breach of paragraph 2.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Second, Ng’s contentions relating to double jeopardy, procedural improprieties, the lack of a fair hearing and rules of natural justice were unmeritorious. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Ng’s contention that there was double jeopardy was a non-starter. The doctrine of double jeopardy cannot be invoked “when a person is faced with different proceedings which are of a completely different nature (<span class="font-italic">eg</span> civil, <span class="font-italic">contra </span>criminal, <span class="font-italic">contra </span>disciplinary), even if these may arise from the same set of facts” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Wee Tin and others v Singapore Swimming Club </span>[2017] SGHCR 21 at [43(c)], citing <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Nathan Edmund </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 905). This is apposite in the present case since Ng’s trial before the State Courts was criminal in nature while the proceedings before the DC was disciplinary in nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Ng further contended that under s 29(6)(b) of the PEA, the complaint against him ought to have been dismissed and the PEB was not permitted to refer the complaint to an IC in the first place.

</div>
</div> However, this was based on a misreading of the provision. Section 29(6) of the PEA provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) On the completion of a review under this section, the Registrar shall — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) dismiss the complaint or information, if he finds that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or without merits, or that the information is unsubstantiated;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) in a case where the complaint or information relates to the conviction (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) of the registered professional engineer of an offence that — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) involves fraud or dishonesty; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) implies a defect in character which makes the registered professional engineer unfit for his profession, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">recommend to the Board to refer the matter to a Disciplinary Committee for a formal inquiry; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) in any other case, recommend the Board to refer the matter to an Investigation Committee for an inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Since Ng’s conviction did not involve fraud or dishonesty or implied a defect in character which made him unfit for his profession, s 29(6)(b) did not apply. However, this did not necessarily mean that the complaint against him ought to have been dismissed. The complaint fell within s 29(6)(c) where the Registrar shall “recommend the Board to refer the matter to an Investigation Committee for an inquiry”. This was precisely what was done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Further, Ng cast aspersions against the PEB’s decision to refer the EMA’s complaint to the DC only 18 months after the IC had made its findings.

</div> The crux of his contention was that the time delay suggested that the PEB had been pressured by the EMA to commence disciplinary proceedings contrary to the IC’s recommendation, which he believed had recommended otherwise.

</div> I found this quite unwarranted. It was well within the purview of the PEB to “make such other order as the Board thinks fit” including referring the complaint to a DC after it had reviewed the findings and recommendations of the IC under s 31B(1)(c) of the PEA. As the word “recommendations” make clear, the PEB was entitled to disagree with the recommendations of the IC and proceed to make any other order it saw fit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Ng also asserted that the DC had prejudged him and simply relied on the State Court’s decision.

</div> The prohibition against prejudgment is an aspect of natural justice. The duty to act in accordance with natural justice is consonant with a duty to act fairly and its content varies with the circumstances of each case (see <span class="font-italic">Kay </span><span class="font-italic">Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 802 at [6]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Ng had not satisfied me that he was denied a fair hearing. It was clear from the Order that the DC applied their mind to the applicability of paragraph 2 of Part II to the Schedule of the PE(CCE) Rules to electrical works and Ng’s due diligence on the facts in coming to its decision. The DC could not be said to have denied Ng a fair hearing simply because the DC had regard to the legal duties owed by a LLEW of an electrical installation as set out in the State Court’s decision. This did not, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, constitute prejudgment. The State Court’s decision on the legal issues raised was final and conclusive unless and until a court of higher jurisdiction overruled it. The DC was correct to take cognisance of the State Court’s decision. If Ng disagreed with the State Court’s interpretation of the law, he could have appealed against the State Court’s decision but did not do so. It would not lie in his mouth to now assert that the rules of natural justice have been breached simply because the DC relied on the State Court’s decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Finally, I did not consider the DC’s imposition of a $7,000.00 penalty manifestly excessive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the premises, I dismissed Ng’s appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I fixed costs and disbursements at $5,000.00 to be paid by the appellant to the respondent.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The appellant in person;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Tuck Kiang Benedict (Benedict Chan &amp; Company) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
