<p xmlns="">interlocutory judgment had already been obtained in the district court – Supreme

Courts Act (Cap 321) s 38</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Facts</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The appellant and the respondent were involved in a motor vehicle

accident on 25 December 1999. On 18 July 2000, the appellant commenced an action against

the respondent for damages for personal injuries arising out of the accident. The defence

was filed on 22 August 2000. Subsequently, about ten months later, on 15 June 2001, the

appellant obtained an interlocutory judgment from the district court, against the

respondent, by consent, with damages to be assessed. On 11 January 2002, the appellant

filed an application to transfer the proceedings from the district court to the High

Court, on the ground that his damages might exceed the jurisdictional limit of the

district court. His application was dismissed by the judicial commissioner in Originating

Summons 46 of 2002/W on the basis that the High Court had no jurisdiction to order the

transfer, in view of the interlocutory judgment. The judicial commissioner further stated

that even if the High Court had the jurisdiction to transfer the proceedings,

notwithstanding the interlocutory judgment, the appellant still had to persuade him to

exercise his discretionary power in the appellant’s favour. He was of the view that

it was too late for the appellant to try and overcome the jurisdictional limit of the

district court via a transfer of the proceedings to the High Court, since the parties had

proceeded and interlocutory judgment was entered on the basis that the damages awarded

would be circumscribed by the jurisdiction of the district court.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held, </p></b>dismissing the appeal :

<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1) Section 18(3) of the SCJA provides very clearly that the powers set

out in the first schedule are to be exercised in accordance with any written law relating

to them. The judicial commissioner had correctly interpreted that, although clause 10 of

the first schedule gives the High Court very wide powers to transfer proceedings from the

district court to the High Court, it has to be read subject to s 38 of the SCA (see  10)

.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2) The power of the High Court to transfer proceedings from a lower

court to itself or <i>vice versa </i>is a necessary one, in the interests of </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">justice. Nevertheless, such a power should not be exercised liberally.

The onus is really on a plaintiff to commence his action in the correct court. The

plaintiff, who has commenced his action in the inappropriate court, ought not to be

allowed, without good cause, to simply rectify his own error by applying for a transfer of

proceedings (see  12). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3) Section 38 of the SCA gives the High Court the discretion to

transfer an entire action, ie the claim, encompassing both the question of liability and

quantum to the High Court. It is not within the spirit of the section, which requires the

matter to be "<i>one which should be tried in the High Court</i>", to permit a

transfer of a case where interlocutory judgment had already been obtained in the district

court, leaving only the quantum to be assessed and what was sought to be transferred to

the High Court was merely the assessment of damages. This would be to truncate a single

proceeding and blur the distinction between the two jurisdictions. By obtaining an

interlocutory judgment in the district court, the appellant had affirmed his claim within

the jurisdiction of that court (see  16).</p>

<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">          This was an

appeal against the decision of the High Court, in Originating Summons No 46 of 2002/W,

which dismissed the appellant’s application to transfer proceedings in the district

court to the High Court, pursuant to s 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act

("SCJA") and O 89 r 2 of the Rules of Court. Having heard counsel for the

parties, we dismissed the appeal with costs. We now give our reasons.</p>
</font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The background</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        The appellant and the

respondent were involved in a motor vehicle accident on 25 December 1999, when the motor

vehicle driven by the respondent collided into the motorcycle ridden by the appellant. The

accident resulted in the death of the appellant’s pillion rider and the respondent

was charged under s 304A of the Penal Code, for causing death by a rash and negligent act.

The respondent pleaded guilty and was fined $8000, in default four months’

imprisonment, and was banned from driving for a period of seven years.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        On 18 July 2000, the

appellant commenced an action against the respondent for damages for personal injuries

arising out of the accident. In the statement of claim filed, the appellant claimed

$33,600.63 for medical expenses and hospitalisation bills incurred, as well as for future

medical expenses. The defence was filed on 22 August 2000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        Subsequently, about ten

months later, on 15 June 2001, the appellant obtained an interlocutory judgment from the

district court, against the respondent by consent, with damages to be assessed. On 4

October 2001, the appellant’s solicitors wrote to the respondent’s solicitors,

asking whether the respondent was willing to consent to the district court having an

increased jurisdiction beyond its limit of $250,000, in view of the fact that the

appellant’s medical expenses had already amounted to $160,000. The appellant was also

scheduled to go for another operation, which would cost approximately $50,000 to $55,000.

There was no reply from the respondent’s solicitors. As a result, the appellant made

an application to transfer proceedings from the district court to the High Court on 11

January 2002.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision below</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        The judicial commissioner

approached the matter by stating that clause 10 of the first schedule to the SCJA should

be read together with s 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act ("SCA"). As such,

although the High Court has a wide power to transfer proceedings from the district court

to the High Court under clause 10, the grounds for doing so should come under one of the

limbs in s 38 of the SCA.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        The judicial commissioner

acknowledged that the possibility of the damages exceeding $250,000 would normally

constitute a "sufficient reason" under s 38 of SCA for an order of transfer.

Nevertheless, he doubted that the High Court had the jurisdiction now to order the

transfer of proceedings, in view of the fact that an interlocutory judgment had already

been granted by the district court. He further stated that, even if the High Court had the

jurisdiction to do so, notwithstanding the interlocutory judgment, the appellant still had

to persuade him to exercise his discretionary power in the appellant’s favour. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        The judicial commissioner

did not accept the argument that the respondent would have consented to an interlocutory

judgment from the High Court in any event. To him, the fact remained that an interlocutory

judgment had been entered in the district court. If the assessment of damages was

conducted without a transfer of proceedings to the High Court, the damages to be awarded

would be circumscribed by the jurisdiction of the district court. Since the parties had

proceeded on that basis and interlocutory judgment was entered on that basis, he was of

the view that it was too late for the appellant to try and overcome the jurisdictional

limit of the district court by applying to transfer the proceedings to the High Court.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The issues</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        Before us, as in the court

below, the issues were first, whether the High Court has the power to transfer the

proceedings from the district court to the High Court when an interlocutory judgment has

already been entered by the district court and secondly, if so, whether the High Court

should have, in its discretion, ordered the transfer.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        At the outset, we would

state that we fully agreed with the judicial commissioner’s reading of s 18(3) of the

SCJA and s 38 of the SCA. Section 18 of the SCJA states that :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">(1)    The High Court shall have such

    powers as are vested in it by any written law for the time being in force in Singapore. </p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">(2)

        Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court

    shall have the powers set out in the First Schedule.</p>
<p align="justify">(3)    The powers referred to in subsection (2) shall be

    exercised in accordance with any written law or Rules of Court relating to them.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        Section 18(3) provides

very clearly that the powers set out in the first schedule are to be exercised in

accordance with any written law relating to them. The judicial commissioner had correctly

interpreted that, although clause 10 of the first schedule gives the High Court very wide

powers to transfer proceedings from the district court to the High Court, it has to be

read subject to s 38 of the SCA, which states that :</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">38. Where it is made to appear to the High Court, on the application of

    a party to any civil proceeding pending in a District Court, that the proceeding by reason

    of its involving some important question of law, or being a test case, or for any other

    sufficient reason, is <i>one which should be tried in the High Court</i>, it may order the

    record to be transferred to the High Court. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        Counsel for the appellant

sought to persuade us that the intention of Parliament in enacting clause 10 of the first

schedule and s 38 of the SCA in the first place was to empower the courts to order a

transfer of proceedings in the district court to the High Court, in order to do

substantial and complete justice. Adjunct to that main purpose, it was further argued that

the provisions gave the appellant a legitimate course of action to rectify a <i>bona fide </i>error

in filing his action in the district court. In addition, it was argued that the

interlocutory judgement could not be a bar to the transfer of the proceedings because an

interlocutory judgment, termed as such, is a judgment which is merely given provisionally

while something remains to be decided before the termination of a cause of action. Hence,

the power to transfer the proceedings to the High Court was "well alive and

potent".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        No doubt, the power of the

High Court to transfer proceedings from a lower court to itself or <i>vice versa </i>is a

necessary one, in the interests of justice. Nevertheless, such power should not be

exercised liberally. The onus is on a plaintiff to commence his action in the correct

court. The plaintiff, who has commenced his action in the inappropriate court, ought not

to be allowed without good cause to simply rectify his own error by applying for a

transfer of proceedings. </p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">13        We were of the view that

the very reason in the first place for the existence of s 38 of the SCA was to place some

restriction on the very wide powers generally conferred by clause 10 of the first

schedule. It is not in every case of an application to transfer proceedings from a

district court to the High Court that such a transfer can and will take place. </p>
<p align="justify">14        The fact that the

interlocutory judgment did not bring the action to an end did not, in our view, advance

the appellant’s case. This was because nothing more was shown other than that the

overriding requirement in s 38 of SCA of "any civil proceeding <i>pending </i>in the

district court" was satisfied. This was, however, not sufficient for an order to

transfer proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify">15        In the case before us, the

claim was a straightforward one for damages for personal injuries. Counsel for the

appellant relied on certain medical reports, in particular the two medical reports by Dr P

Thiagarajan, dated 19 September and 15 December 2001, to show that the appellant was going

to incur further medical expenses and hence, there was a possibility that his damages

might exceed the jurisdictional limit of the district court. Ordinarily, this would be

well within the third limb of s 38 of the SCA, constituting "sufficient reason"

for the High Court to transfer the proceedings. </p>
<p align="justify">16        Unfortunately, an

interlocutory judgment had already been obtained from the district court. In our opinion,

s 38 gives the High Court the discretion to transfer an entire action, ie, the claim,

encompassing both the question of liability and quantum to the High Court. We did not

think that it is within the spirit of the section, which requires the matter to be "<i>one

which should be tried in the High Court</i>", to permit a transfer of a case where

interlocutory judgment had already been obtained in the district court, leaving only the

quantum to be assessed, and what was sought to be transferred to the High Court was merely

the assessment of damages. This would be to truncate a single proceeding and blur the

distinction between the two jurisdictions. By obtaining an interlocutory judgment in the

district court, the appellant had affirmed his claim within the jurisdiction of that

court.</p>
<p align="justify">17        With regard to the only

case cited to us by counsel for the appellant, <i>Australian Masters Builders Co Pte Ltd v

Ng Tai Tuan </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=3262&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">(1988) 1 MLJ 273</a>, we would only say that the judicial commissioner

correctly distinguished that case, in that there was no interlocutory judgment in favour

of the plaintiffs for the balance of the claim and the application was to transfer High

Court proceedings to the district court, with a corresponding reduction in their claim.</p>
<p align="justify">18        Though this was not vital

to our conclusion, we would add that, in this case, the appellant had had several medical

reports in his hand in the course of the proceedings in the district court, which

indicated strongly that his damages might exceed the jurisdictional limit of the district

court. In particular, in the medical report dated 15 August 2000 prepared by Dr Yeo Khee

Quan of Yeo Orthopaedic Centre, it was stated that the appellant had had multiple

operations in an attempt to control infection and these had failed as he was still

discharging sinus and there was evidence of infection in the upper fracture site. Dr Yeo

was of the opinion that the appellant was likely to require <i>multiple operations </i>in

the future in an attempt to correct his problem. The chances of success in these

operations were doubtful and the appellant would probably require extensive and prolonged

care in the next two years.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        In the light of all these

medical reports made available to him, the appellant ought to have known that his damages

might exceed the jurisdictional limit of the district court. He ought to have considered

transferring the proceedings to the High Court at that stage. Instead, he chose to obtain

an interlocutory judgment against the respondent, by consent on 15 June 2001. In these

circumstances, we were of the view that the appellant should not be allowed to transfer

the proceedings to the High Court.</p>
