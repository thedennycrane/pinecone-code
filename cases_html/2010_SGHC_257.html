<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Applicant, Soh Eng Beng, is the executor and
                    trustee of the estate of Soh Kim Poo, deceased (“the testator”),
                    and by this application in Originating Summons No 48 of 2010 (“OS
                    48/2010”), the Applicant seeks a declaration as to the true construction
                    of clause 5 of the testator’s will dated 7 February 2002
                    (“the Will”). The Respondent, Soh Eng Koon, is one of the
                    testator’s sons and a beneficiary under the Will. He has applied in
                    Summons No 1566 of 2010 for, <em>inter alia</em>, an order
                    to rectify clause 5 of the Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Will</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The dispute before me relates to clause 5
                    of the Will. It is, however, helpful to set out clauses 4 to 6 in their
                    entirety, so that the provision in issue can be considered in its
                    context:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold and capital letters in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The testator died on 16 May 2002. The
                    beneficiaries under the Will are his ten children, namely:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       It is common ground that the name of the third
                    beneficiary, “Soh Lai Ying”, in clause 5 of the Will was
                    incorrectly spelt as “Ying”, and that it ought rightly to be
                    “Yim”. Hence, the name of the third beneficiary in clause 5
                    should read as “Soh Lai Yim”. It is also common ground that at all
                    material times, the registered owners of No 31C Lorong 34 Geylang, Singapore
                    (“the Property”) were the testator and Soh Eng Guan as tenants in
                    common in unequal shares, with the testator holding 4/5 (80%) share in the
                    Property and Soh Eng Guan, the remaining 1/5 (20%) share.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The rival contentions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Roland Tong for the Applicant argues
                    that, upon the proper construction of clause 5 of the Will, the presence of
                    the phrase “my half (1/2) share of the property” conveys the
                    natural meaning that the testator intended to bequeath one-half of his <em>entire</em> interest in the Property, which he co-owned with
                    Soh Eng Guan as tenants in common, to the three persons named in the
                    clause to receive the bequeath in the percentage share enumerated against
                    their respective names. The remaining part of his interest in the Property falls
                    into the residue of the estate to be distributed in accordance with
                    clause 6 of the Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In opposition, Mr Mark Goh, who was
                    instructed as counsel for the Respondent, argues that the Applicant’s
                    construction of the specific bequest in clause 5 is wrong. The testator
                    intended to bequeath his <em>entire</em> interest in the
                    Property (<em>ie</em> his 4/5 share) to the three named
                    beneficiaries. Had the testator intended any part of the Property to be part of
                    the residuary estate, the testator (so the argument ran) would not have taken
                    pains to single out the Property from the rest of his estate in the first place.
                    According to Mr Goh, the Applicant’s interpretation of clause 5
                    would give rise to a whimsical and capricious situation in that the three named
                    beneficiaries would stand to inherit an additional share each in the
                    testator’s remaining interest in the Property under clause 6.
                    Mr Goh cites para 429 from <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        England</em> vol 50 (Butterworths, 4th Edition) which is different
                    from the 2005 Reissue Edition. Be that as it may, there is para 483 in the
                    2005 Reissue Edition which, <em>inter alia</em>, provides
                    that where there is ambiguity in the ascertainment of the intention of the
                    testator, the principle that arises is that the court would not attribute to him
                    a capricious or unreasonable intention to his dispositions, where the words of
                    his will can be read otherwise. If the testator’s intention was to give
                    his interest in the Property to all his ten children, Mr Goh argues that
                    the testator could have easily named all his ten children in clause 5. He
                    could also indicate the share each child is to receive. Mr Goh concludes
                    that the phrase “my half (1/2) share of the property” in
                    clause 5 was an inadvertent mistake on the part of the draftsman of the
                    Will. Clause 5 should rightly read as “my share of the property”,
                    after deleting the word “half (1/2)” from the
                clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Apart from the interpretation of clause 5
                    of the Will argued for by Mr Goh, the Respondent has an alternative claim
                    for the sum of $243,106, being the amount he contributed to the testator’s
                    purchase of the Property. It was made clear that this alternative claim only
                    arises if the court favours the Applicant’s construction of clause 5
                    of the Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The construction issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The starting point when construing any will is
                    to determine the intention of the testator by giving the words of the will the
                    meaning that they naturally bear, having regard to the context of the will as a
                    whole. Little assistance in construing a will is likely to be gained by
                    consideration of how other judges have interpreted similar wording in other
                    cases. Textual analysis looks at the language used in the Will and the approach
                    involves different textual methods of interpretation. If there is some
                    uncertainty or ambiguity in the will, then it is necessary to have recourse to
                    extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The key submission from both sides is based on
                    the word “half (1/2)”in clause 5. Specifically, the issue for
                    the Respondent is whether clause 5 contains an inaccurate description of
                    the testator’s actual interest in the Property, or as Mr Tong argues,
                    the word “half (1/2)” is significant. It must be read as a word of
                    restriction to limit the specific bequeath to only one-half of the
                    testator’s interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is clear from the schedule under
                    s 41(2) of the Estate Duty Act (Cap 96, 1997 Rev Ed) that was
                    annexed to the Grant of Probate that the testator died leaving (i) immovable
                    properties - (a) half share in No 25 Lorong 4 Geylang, Singapore and (b) 4/5
                    (80%) share in No 31C Lorong 34, Geylang, Singapore; (ii) stocks and shares in
                    various public and private companies in Singapore and Malaysia; and (iii) cash
                    in hand and in bank accounts in Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     This leads me to the Will. There are two
                    specific bequests of immoveable properties in the Will. They are contained in
                    clauses 4 and 5. In clause 4, the testator made a specific bequest of the
                    whole of his interest in the property known as No 25 Lorong 4 Geylang to his
                    son, Soh Eng Tai, absolutely. In relation to this property, the testator was a
                    co-owner in equal shares of the property with one of his sons, and the
                    clause correctly described the testator’s interest in the property.
                    The fact remains that the testator’s intention under clause 4 was to
                    dispose of his entire interest in the property to Soh Eng Tai. The specific
                    bequest of the second immoveable property is found in clause 5. This time
                    the property in question is No 31C Lorong 34, Geylang (“the
                    Property”) and the bequest is divided among three named beneficiaries.
                    The rest of the estate is described in clause 6 as the
                    “residue”. Clause 6 sets out for whom the residuary estate would
                    be divided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     With the scheme of the Will as set out in
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> in mind, I turn to the opening
                    words of clause 5. On a textual approach to construing the will and without
                    reference at this stage to extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation, it is
                    clear from the language of clause 5 that the testator was aware that he was
                    not the sole owner of the Property in that he shared it with his son, Soh Eng
                    Guan. This is evident from his reference to part ownership of the Property. The
                    testator has also in clause 5 identified the persons to whom he really
                    wanted to benefit by the bequest. In clause 5, the testator divided the
                    bequest among three named beneficiaries in the following proportion: Soh Eng
                    Guan (35%); Soh Eng Koon (35%) and Soh Lai Yim (30%). The percentages add up to
                    100%. The cumulative effect of these indicators as described are consistent with
                    the testator’s primary wish to give away what he owned (<em>ie</em>, his entire interest as co-owner of the Property) in the same
                    way as he had intended in clause 4 in respect of the other Geylang
                    property. The use of clause 4 as a matter of construction lends credence to
                    the argument that the purpose of clause 5 is to bequeath what belonged to
                    the testator to three named beneficiaries. I am further persuaded that this is
                    the correct interpretation of the Will by the fact that the properties in
                    clauses 4 and 5 were the only two immovable properties which the testator owned.
                    The rest of his assets consisted of cash and stocks. The scheme of the Will
                    strongly suggests that the testator had intended to dispose of his immovable
                    properties in the same fashion <em>ie</em> by way of a
                    specific gift to named children rather than to leave the immovable properties to
                    be distributed as part of the residuary estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The phrase - “my
                    half (1/2) share of the property”
                    - is descriptive in nature. Besides the address, the
                    testator’s part ownership in the Property was particularised to complete
                    the description of the Property. Instead of referencing the co-ownership that
                    was in unequal shares, the draftsman stated it to be in equal shares. I disagree
                    with Mr Tong that the phrase contains words of restriction to cut down by
                    limiting the bequest to one-half of the testator’s interest in the
                    Property. Mr Tong’s argument has merit if the draftsman had phrased
                    clause 5 as: “I devise and bequeath half (1/2) <em>my</em> share of the property ...” (emphasis added), and not
                    as it appears in clause 5, namely, “I devise and bequeath <em>my</em> half (1/2) share of the property ...”
                    (emphasis added). In my view, and I so find and hold, the reference to
                    “my half (1/2) share of the property” is a misdescription of the
                    testator’s interest as co-owner of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Another way of arriving at the conclusion (and
                    to test, at the same time, its correctness) that the testator intended to
                    bequeath his entire interest in the Property to the named beneficiaries is via
                    the useful canon of construction of documents, ‘<em>falsa
                        demonstratio non nocet cum de corpore constat’</em> which
                    translates as a false description does not vitiate when there is no doubt as to
                    the subject matter. The false description must merely be added onto that which
                    is otherwise true. John G. Ross Martyn, Stuart Bridge &amp; Mika Oldham,
                        <em>Theobald on Wills</em>, (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        16<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2001) at para 23-01 explains the
                    maxim in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle of <em>falsa demonstratio non
                            nocet</em> means that if, on considering the language of a will
                        with the aid of any admissible extrinsic evidence, the court comes to the
                        conclusion that the testator intended to pass something and can determine
                        what that something is, then the fact that the testator gave it a wrong
                        description in his will does not prevent the will taking effect in regard to
                        the subject matter intended by the testator. The principle may be applied in
                        whatever part of the description the error occurred. The principle of
                            <em>falsa demonstratio</em> also applies to a wrong
                        description of a person in a will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The <em>falsa
                        demonstratio</em> principle does not apply if the description fits the
                    property so that any enlargement of the meaning by extrinsic evidence to include
                    some other property is excluded. Francis Barlow <em>et al,
                        Williams on Wills</em>, (Butterworths, 9<sup>th</sup>
                    Ed, 2008) at para 58.3 explains the exclusion of the <em>falsa demonstratio</em> principle thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Additional words are not rejected as importing a false description if they
                        can be read as words of restriction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I have already explained in <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> and <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above that the draftsman’s use of the word “half (1/2)” was
                    not to describe a limited interest that was intended to pass by specific
                    bequeath to the three named beneficiaries. It is possible to reject the word
                    “half (1/2)” as a <em>falsa
                    demonstratio</em>. The misdescription of the part of his interest in the
                    Property did not prevent the Will taking effect in regard to Property in
                    question, and the specific bequeath in clause 5 is not
                vitiated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The conclusion which I have thus far reached
                    on the wording of the Will is confirmed by the evidence as to what the testator
                    meant and intended by clause 5 of his Will. The evidence shows that the
                    testator wanted to part with his interest in the Property. The misdescription of
                    the testator’s interest is a mistake; one that was likely to be made in
                    the circumstances in which the Will was drawn up and executed. I now turn to the
                    evidence relating to the drafting of the Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the cover page of the Will is the name of
                    the law firm of Messrs Viyay &amp; Co. Mr Tong informed the court that he
                    had contacted Mr Narayanan Vijya Kumar (“Mr Vijya”), for
                    his assistance in relation the Will drawn up by his firm. Mr Vijya filed an
                    affidavit on 27<sup>th</sup> April 2010. Unfortunately, the
                    matters deposed in his affidavit were vague and, in fact, raised more questions
                    than answers and his affidavit evidence did not assist in resolving the dispute
                    before the court. I, therefore, allowed Mr Tong’s application to
                    cross-examine Mr Vijya on his affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the witness box, Mr Vijya disclosed
                    that, at the material time, he was in India as his mother suddenly suffered a
                    stroke, and as his testimony unfolded, it became clear that his secretary, one
                    Helen Tan (“Helen”), took the testator’s instructions on his
                    will and it was she who drew up the draft that was sent to the testator’s
                    son, Soh Eng Beng, for the testator’s consideration. There were apparently
                    amendments to the draft. Presumably, the amendments were attended to by Helen.
                    In his affidavit, Mr Vijya deposed that he has no record of any documents
                    or file relating to the Will. In cross-examination, Mr Vijya confirmed that
                    no attendance notes were taken by Helen or anyone else. As shown on the Will,
                    Helen and her colleague, Zalinah Kamis, witnessed the testator’s execution
                    of the Will after Helen explained the contents of the Will in Hokkien to the
                    testator. From Mr Vijya’s evidence, we learn that
                    Mr Vijya’s friend, Mr Lukshumayeh, an advocate &amp; solicitor,
                    who would help out Mr Vijya’s firm in his absence, has no
                    recollection of his involvement with this Will. I think it is fair to conclude
                    that after taking the testator’s instructions, Helen drew up the Will,
                    explained in the Hokkien dialect the contents of the Will to the testator who
                    signed it thereafter in her presence and that of her colleague.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In arguing for the interpretation subscribed
                    by the Applicant’s, Mr Tong submits that there is no evidence that
                    the testator meant to give his entire share in the Property to the three named
                    beneficiaries, and that there was further, no evidence that Helen Tan did not
                    take his instructions properly, or had made a mistake in the drafting of the
                    Will. Therefore, clause 5 should thus be interpreted in such a way that
                    half of the testator’s interest in the Property be divided among the three
                    named beneficiaries, and the remaining half to go towards the residuary estate
                    to be divided equally among the testator’s ten children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I concluded for the reasons given that the
                    testator’s interest in the Property was misdescribed in clause 5. As
                    the testator had indeed owned a half-share in the property known as No. 25
                    Lorong 4 Geylang, which was the subject matter in clause 4 of the Will, it
                    would not be implausible for the draftsman to have copied the wording of
                    clause 4 for clause 5, and to have simply changed the address of the
                    property in question before typing out the names of the three beneficiaries and
                    their respective shares in percentage terms. I noticed that the words
                    “half (1/2) share” were in bold print in clause 4 but not in
                    clause 5. The significance of that, if any, is a matter of speculation. Be
                    that as it may, we now know it was Helen who drew up the Will. The likelihood of
                    a mistake being committed was all the more probable without the apparent benefit
                    of legal supervision or review of her work which on the face of the document
                    contained an error in the spelling of the name of Soh Lai Yim. The other
                    mistake, as I have found, is in the description of the testator’s share as
                    co-owner of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For the reasons stated, the Will is construed
                    as contended for by the Respondent. Since the construction issue is resolved in
                    favour of the Respondent, the issue of rectification no longer remains a
                    “live” issue save for the misspelling of the name of the third
                    beneficiary which ought to be spelt as “Soh Lai Yim” and not
                    “Soh Lai Ying”. However, since I have concluded that the primary
                    wish of the testator in clause 5 of the Will is to bequeath his entire
                    interest in the Property, the misdescription of the testator’s interest is
                    best removed. I therefore order clause 5 be rectified to the extent that
                    the word “half” be deleted from clause 5, such that it
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I devise and bequeath my share of the property known as <b>31C Lorong 34 Geylang, Singapore</b> to my following children:
                        -</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)   SOH ENG GUAN (NRIC No. [xxx]) – 35%</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)   SOH ENG KOON (NRIC No. [xxx]) – 35%</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)   SOH LAI YIM (NRIC No. [xxx]) – 30%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On costs, I order that the estate pays the Respondent’s costs of
                    OS 48/2010 and Summons No 1566 of 2010 to be taxed, if not agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It remains to be said that these proceedings
                    highlight some professional shortcomings, and it is appropriate that I draw
                    attention to the timely reminder by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline</em>
                    [2010] SGCA 27 (“<em>Chee
                        Muriel”)</em> at [60]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... solicitors who undertake the task of preparing wills and/or witnessing
                        the execution of wills must take the necessary precautions or steps in order
                        to fulfil their duties to their clients. The precautions are not complicated
                        nor are they time consuming. In any case, as solicitors, they must do what
                        is required, however complicated or difficult the task may be. The central
                        task is to ensure that the terms of the will reflect the wishes of the
                        testator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Some of the precautions noted by Chan CJ
                    in [60] “as a matter of good professional practice, if not professional
                    prudence”, is that “the solicitor should make a contemporary
                    written record of his or her attendances on the testator so that he or she would
                    be able to recall exactly what had transpired during the meeting or
                    meetings”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is also helpful to close this discourse on
                    the proper discharge of professional responsibilities in drawing up a Will by
                    quoting an apt warning in <em>Low Ah Cheow and others v Ng Hock
                        Guan</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079 at [73], which was cited in
                        <em>Chee Muriel</em> (at [61]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The preparation of a will involves serious professional responsibilities,
                        which solicitors must uncompromisingly observe and discharge. Regrettably,
                        it seems to us that, all too often nowadays, solicitors appear to consider
                        the preparation of a will to be no more than a routine exercise in form
                        filling. This is <em>wrong</em>. Before preparing a
                        will, the solicitor concerned ought to have a thorough discussion with the
                        testator on all the possible legal issues and potential complications that
                        might arise in the implementation of the terms of the will. The solicitor
                        ought to painstakingly and accurately document his discussions with and his
                        instructions from the testator. He should also confirm with the testator,
                        prior to the execution of the will, that the contents of the will as drafted
                        accurately express the latter’s intention. A translation, if required,
                        must be thoroughly and competently done. Half measures or the cutting of
                        corners in the discharge of these serious professional responsibilities will
                        not do.</p>
