First, the court will ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard to the text and context of the provision. Second, the court will ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the statute and the provision in question. Third, the court will compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute and choose the interpretation that best advances the statutory object or purpose. The court may in specified circumstances also refer to extraneous materials which do not form part of the written law in which the provision is found, in order to ascertain the meaning of the provision, but primacy is accorded to the text and context of the provision. Where the ordinary meaning of the provision is clear, extraneous material can only be used to confirm the ordinary meaning but not to alter it (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span> at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I begin by considering the plain wording of s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the CPC. From the text, I distil that for a release of property to be ordered by the court under this provision, several conditions must be met. First, there is a requirement of necessity. The release of funds must be necessary for the payment of professional fees or reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the provision of legal services. Second, there is a requirement of exclusivity. The released funds must be used exclusively for such fees or reimbursement of expenses. Third, there is a requirement of reasonableness. Where payment for professional fees is sought, such fees must be reasonable. Fourth, there is a requirement that reimbursement of expenses be retrospective rather than prospective. Such expenses must already have been “incurred”. Fifth, the above requirements must be cumulatively shown to the satisfaction of the court as a precondition to the release of property under s 35(7) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I pause briefly to note that there is some degree of apparent textual ambiguity as to whether the clauses of “payment of reasonable professional fees” and “reimbursement of any expenses incurred” are to be read disjunctively or conjunctively in relation to the modifier “in connection with the provision of legal services”. That is, it is unclear as to whether only incurred expenses have to be connected with the provision of legal services, or whether both professional fees and expenses have to be so connected. In my view, both clauses should be read as subject to that modifier. Were the modifier not to apply to the first clause, the scope of “professional fees” would be overly ambiguous, since the adjective “professional” can apply to a wide range of different services and skills. This is at odds with the specific nature of the other subsections under s 35(8) of the CPC, which relate to well-delimited areas of expenses such as payment for foodstuff, rent, the discharge of a mortgage, or fees imposed for the routine holding or maintenance of property which the Applicant is prevented from dealing in. It also would be anomalous for reimbursement of expenses to be limited to legal services, but for professional fees to not be subject to such a limitation. Further, as I outline at [42] below, such a reading better accords with the legislative history of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I now consider the legislative intent of the statute. The remarks of the Minister for Law in Parliament during the Second Reading of the Criminal Procedure Code Bill (No. 11 of 2010) are instructive (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(18 May 2010), vol 87 at col 412):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If property liable to be seized is held with a financial institution, a Police officer of Inspector rank or above may issue a written order to direct the financial institution to either deliver the property to any Police officer, or refrain from dealing in respect of such property within a specified period.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At the same time, an absolute power to freeze property in a bank account may be unduly harsh on the affected person. Hence, a person whose bank account has been the subject of a written order may apply to court for the release of such property to meet legitimate expenses. For example, the payment of basic expenses, reasonable professional fees or, in the context of a company, day-to-day running expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The legislative purpose of s 35(8) of the CPC, which includes 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i), is to regulate what would otherwise be an absolute power of the police to freeze bank accounts, and guard against “unduly harsh” consequences for persons affected by police seizure of property. The concern, in contrast to s 370 of the CPC, is not about legal entitlement to the seized property, but merely whether the Applicant can satisfy one of the criteria under s 35(8): see <span class="font-italic">Mustafa Ahunbay v Public Prosecutor</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1049 at [14] (“<span class="font-italic">Mustafa Ahunbay</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Importantly, the above remarks contextualise the criteria under s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the CPC as bearing the common denominator of being “legitimate” expenses. The meaning of “legitimate” expenses is best understood by reference to the qualifiers chosen by the Minister to preface examples of expenses, which include “basic”, “reasonable”, and “day-to-day”. These terms are directly drawn from the wording of the statute, and they point towards the nature of the expenses as being ordinarily recognised as capable of causing hardship should the payee be unable to obtain funds to make payment for them. A consideration of the broader provision of s 35(8) of the CPC reinforces this conclusion. Apart from s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), which covers extraordinary expenses, each of the subsections outlines a category of expenses for which non-payment will result in hardship—whether in the form of an adverse impact on a basic standard of living (s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)), an inability to satisfy a judicial, administrative or arbitral lien or judgment (s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)), or the cessation of a company’s operations (s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Having found that the legislative purpose of s 35(8) of the CPC is to prevent undue hardship from arising from police seizure of property, I briefly comment on the overall nature of the assessment under s 35(8) before elaborating on the five requirements of s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) outlined above at [29].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As suggested in the Minister’s remarks above, the release of seized property under s 35(8) is subject to a balancing exercise between the competing concerns of ensuring the efficacy of police investigations, and prejudice to those potentially affected by police seizures. As set out in <span class="font-italic">Mustafa Ahunbay</span> at [13]–[14]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 It will be readily apparent that both sections have different concerns and procedures. Section 35 of the CPC, which governs the powers of seizure, is more comprehensive and takes into account the needs of those who may be affected by the seizure. A balancing exercise is permitted under ss 35(7)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 35(8) which is not part of the judicial exercise which subsequently takes place in s 370. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 The balancing exercise which the Magistrate’s Court may perform pursuant to ss 35(7)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 35(8) is between the exigencies of the investigation or proceedings and the potential hardship to “any person who is prevented from dealing with the property”. This is a broad class of persons which could conceivably include the possessor of the seized property at the time of seizure, or any person with a contingent claim to that property … This person could bring an application to ask for the property seized (or part thereof) to be released, so long as he can satisfy one of the criteria of necessity in s 35(8) of the CPC. There is no need to prove that the Applicant under s 35(7)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is legally entitled to the seized property (or to any part of it); that is not the test under s 35(8).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 This was further elaborated on in <span class="font-italic">Vivosant Corp SA v Public Prosecutor </span>(HC/CM 37/2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Vivosant</span>”) at [13]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 … The overall enquiry necessitates the balancing exercise of looking into whether an order for release of funds is necessary in the interests of justice – adopting the test in <span class="font-italic">Mustafa Ahunbay v PP</span> (at [14]), having regard to the exigencies of the investigation or proceedings, would denying the Applicant access to the funds sought cause undue hardship and injustice?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I agree with the remarks as framed in <span class="font-italic">Vivosant</span>, which<span class="font-italic"> </span>align with the general common law principle that the police’s entitlement to retain lawfully seized evidence for as long as is reasonably necessary is subject to regard for the interests of justice (<span class="font-italic">Goldring Timothy Nicholas and others v Public Prosecutor</span> [2013] 3 SLR 487 at [27], citing Keith Tronc, Cliff Crawford and Doug Smith, Search and Seizure in Australia and New Zealand (LBC Information Services, 1996) at p 21). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I now consider the requirements that are apparent from the wording of s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i). I first consider the requirement of necessity. An applicant under s 35(8) must show that no funds within their possession are otherwise available. Were this not the case, release of seized property would not be necessary. This raises the question as to whether the applicant has any alternative sources of funding, as noted in the unreported case of <span class="font-italic">OCAP Management Pte. Ltd. </span><span class="font-italic">v Public Prosecutor</span> (CM 41/2020) (“<span class="font-italic">OCAP</span>”) at [9]. There, the applicant had alleged that it had no sources of funds in seeking the partial release of seized funds to make payments to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore and for legal fees. The court dismissed the application. It held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that despite the applicant’s assertions to the contrary there was evidence of significant incoming funds on a monthly and quarterly basis from external entities, which would provide a resource for addressing many of the applicant’s alleged expenses: <span class="font-italic">OCAP </span>at [9]. This illustrates the need for the court to be alive to the possibility that alternative sources of funds are available to an applicant, despite apparent assertions to the contrary. The exact level of scrutiny that is appropriate for each case may differ, having regard to the whether there is evidence of the means of the applicant and their circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I next consider the requirement of exclusivity. The basic meaning of this requirement, as the text of the provision provides, is that the release of funds should be used only for the payment of the fees and expenses under s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) or (ii). However, in addition to this basic meaning, the interpretation of exclusivity should be guided by the legislative intention of safeguarding the affected person whose property has been frozen. Accordingly, it follows that any funds released should be used exclusively for legal fees and expenses <span class="font-italic">of</span><span class="font-italic"> the Applicant</span>. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Vivosant</span>, See Kee Oon J declined to release funds from the applicant’s seized bank account to pay for legal expenses incurred for matters that pertained to his company Tacla. He held that the applicant and Tacla were separate legal entities, and that there was no reason why the applicant had to be liable for such payments: <span class="font-italic">Vivosant</span> at [5].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 This reading of the requirement of exclusivity is bolstered by a consideration of the legislative history of s 35(8). Subsection 8 was adapted from Order 89A rule 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2006 Rev Ed) (“rule 6”) which dealt with matters pertaining to seizures under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”) (see <span class="font-italic">The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore: Annotations and Commentary</span> (Jennifer Marie &amp; Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir gen eds) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 04.163). I reproduce the relevant portion of rule 6 below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Restraint orders and charging orders (O. 89A, r. 6)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6.—(1) A restraint order may be made subject to conditions and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">exceptions, including —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) conditions relating to the indemnifying of third parties against expenses incurred in complying with the order; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(b) exceptions relating to living expenses and legal expenses of the defendant,</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">but the Public Prosecutor shall not be required to give an undertaking to abide by any order as to damages sustained by the defendant as a result of the restraint order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As seen above, for an exception to be made to a restraint order under the CDSA, rule 6(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) required that the legal expenses must be relating to the defendant (that is, the subject of the restraint order). Although the present wording of s 35(8) does not bear such a restriction, I do not see good reasons why a similar understanding of the limitation of the use of such funds in rule 6 should not also apply to any application under that s 35(8). The expenses of a separate legal entity from the Applicant should not ordinarily necessitate the release of funds under s 35(8), particularly where the Applicant is not personally liable for those expenses. This is true even if it may be in the Applicant’s interests that such expenses are paid: <span class="font-italic">Vivosant </span>at [5].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I also note that the wording of rule 6 also supports the interpretation of s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) as being, as a whole, concerned with legal expenses, rather than with a broad range of professional fees. This supports the analysis at [30] above that both the professional fees and expenses mentioned in the subsection should be in connection with the provision of legal services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I next consider the requirement of reasonableness. I start by noting that although this requirement seems to only apply to professional fees based on the wording of s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i), there is no reason why this requirement should not also apply to expenses incurred in connection with the provision of legal services. Invoices for expenses incurred in the course of a lawyer’s work are no less amenable to scrutiny than invoices for that lawyer’s professional fees. Such expenses, disbursements, and charges would also normally be considered together with professional fees and remuneration as part of the costs for which a legal practitioner would charge (see for example s 2 of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (2020 Rev Ed) and r 17(7) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Two further points on the reasonableness of fees and expenses claimed under s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) should be made. First, given that the court must be satisfied of the reasonableness of the fees, the onus should be on an applicant seeking the release of funds under this provision to adduce sufficient information for the court to undertake an assessment of the reasonableness of the amount claimed. Second, in assessing reasonableness, the court should consider whether the amount claimed is traceable and proportionate to the reason for incurring such expenses. The release of funds under s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) is thus not, as the Applicant claims, an “unfettered right” to, for example, “engage as many lawyers as [the Applicant] requires”, but a decision subject to considerations of the nature and complexity of the proceedings at hand.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I now consider the fourth requirement that reimbursement must be of expenses already incurred. Again, there is linguistic ambiguity from the syntax of the statute. It is not clear whether the word “incurred” refers only to expenses, or to both professional fees and expenses. I am of the view that the word should apply to both. For one, there is no immediately appreciable distinction between legal professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with legal services which would suggest that the former should be able to be claimed prospectively while the latter should be restricted to claims for work already done. I also echo the reasoning of See J in <span class="font-italic">Vivosant</span> at [7] that effective supervision of the requirement of reasonableness necessitates restricting the release of funds for both professional fees and expenses to those which have been already incurred:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7  Turning to the remaining categories (c) and (e), there may be grounds in principle for the Applicant to rely on s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) if there is indeed a demonstrated need for funds to pay for “reasonable professional fees” or “expenses incurred in connection with the provision of legal services” to the Applicant. The construction of s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) proposed by the respondent relies on the word “incurred” as being operative both for “professional fees” and “expenses”. Adopting the alternative interpretation proposed by the Applicant, s 35(8)(b)(i) can be read more widely to extend beyond work already done and billed, to encompass contingent billings and, by extension, even expenses for work envisaged in the future. With respect, this would entail considerable speculation as to how much might prospectively be billed, and also require a readiness to accept that it will be a “reasonable” expense even when the work remains to be done and the expense has yet to be incurred. Even if counsel were to furnish an undertaking that any funds released must be ring-fenced specifically for payment of reasonable professional fees or expenses, this does not adequately resolve the question of whether the expenses will be objectively reasonable in the first place. Such an approach is fraught with uncertainty and plainly unworkable in practice. This strongly indicates that the Applicant’s interpretation does not accord with statutory intent. I am therefore of the view that the court should concern itself only with fees or expenses in respect of liability for work that has already been done (and either billed or billable).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Finally, I reiterate that the above requirements must be cumulatively shown to the satisfaction of the court as a precondition to the release of property under s 35(7) of the CPC. The burden is on the Applicant to adduce sufficient evidence in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Singapore proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The expenses claimed in respect of the Singapore proceedings involve TSMP’s representation of the Applicant in liaising with the CAD and Attorney-General’s Chambers, appearing at a hearing to oppose the continued seizure of the funds in the Applicant’s BOS account under s 370 of the CPC, drafting documents for the same, and corresponding with other institutions and law firms.

</div> On the basis of this finding (the veracity of which is not the subject of this proceeding), the remaining balance in the Banque Syz account of USD$1,131,583,245.00 reported by the Applicant to the Geneva PPO as of 4 June 2019 would more than explain the allegedly unaccounted amount.

In relation to the Applicant’s undisclosed number of Portuguese bank accounts, counsel conceded during the hearing that they did not have any available documentation for these accounts or for the freezing orders, nor any information on the balance of money in the accounts when they were frozen.

</div>
</div> This gives some reason to doubt the veracity of the Applicant’s assertions in this regard. It is important to highlight that this issue only goes towards a finding as to the strength of evidence in favour of the Applicant’s claims, rather than a finding that funds in these alleged companies are actually available for the Applicant’s use – even if they were, I acknowledge that they would be subject to the Angolan confiscation order and would not be amenable to be utilised by the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I thus note that there is some degree of uncertainty as to whether the Applicant does in fact have other assets which he can access. This is not to say that an applicant under s 35(8) of the CPC must exhaustively produce comprehensive documentation of every financial interest and bank account that he or she owns. I am also cognisant of the Applicant’s circumstances in this specific case and the potential difficulties he faces in obtaining documentation, particularly for his Angolan assets. Yet, this must be balanced against the Applicant’s wealth, the numerous cross-jurisdictional transfers of large amounts of money that the Applicant has instructed between his bank accounts in the past, and the international nature of the Applicant’s assets which make it difficult to survey the true extent of the Applicant’s wealth (as illustrated by the presence of more than €18 million in a personal bank account in the United Kingdom which was not disclosed or explained in any affidavit). In the circumstances, I am unable to find as a fact that the Applicant is unable to access funds which represent less than a fraction of a percentage of his wealth solely based on his bare assertions. Some degree of documentation, or at the very least the ability to identify, for example, the companies that are subject to alleged freezing orders in Portugal for which no documentation exists, would be necessary to sustain a finding that he is indeed unable to obtain alternative sources of funding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Prosecution also submits that there have been significant outflows from the Applicant’s BOS account to the Portuguese bank accounts of his immediate family members, the sum of which exceeds the sum sought in the present application (see [18] above). The Prosecution argues that these funds should be used to pay for the Applicant’s legal fees.

</div> The question thus arises as to whether the assets of the Applicant’s family members can be considered part of the pool of assets available to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Applicant argues that the funds in the Portuguese bank accounts belong solely to the Applicant’s family members, were legitimately transferred for payment of their living expenses, investment purposes and savings, and in any event are no longer accessible as these accounts have been frozen.

</div> Relying on the reasoning of See J in <span class="font-italic">Vivosant </span>at [5], he argues that in the same way that Tacla and the applicant in that case were separate legal entities such that the applicant could not be liable for Tacla’s legal expenses, the Applicant’s immediate family members are separate legal persons from the Applicant and should not be liable for his legal expenses.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I disagree with the reasoning of the Applicant. The holding in <span class="font-italic">Vivosant </span>pertained to the <span class="font-italic">use </span>of released funds needing to be exclusively <span class="font-italic">for</span> the Applicant (see [39] above). This should be distinguished from the present case, which involves asking whether the <span class="font-italic">source </span>of alternative funds has to be exclusively <span class="font-italic">from</span> the Applicant. This distinction is important. The concept of exclusivity of use of released funds can be readily inferred from the legislative intention behind s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the CPC, and from the history of that provision. Conversely, there is no suggestion from the plain wording and context of the provision that assessment of an applicant’s alternative sources of funding must be restricted to assets over which the applicant has legal title. In fact, there are compelling reasons why such an assessment should in some circumstances extend to other external sources of funding. For example, an applicant seeking release of funds for payment of basic expenses for foodstuff and medicine might very well have access to government subsidies or grants. The fact that this source of funding comes from an external party should not be a barrier to the court taking this into account, as long as such subsidies or grants can be accessed without undue hardship to the applicant. It might also be the case that an applicant has insufficient funds in his own bank account to pay for legal services at the time of making an application but may have impending transfers of money from third parties in the near future. It would not be inappropriate for a court to consider that an alternative source of funding could come from lines of credit from a financial institution, if there is evidence that such lines of credit are available, the impending transfers of money are of a sufficient quantum to pay off his liabilities, and no undue hardship would befall the applicant as a result of such an arrangement. I thus find that an assessment of an applicant’s alternative sources of funding can encompass the availability of capital (or credit) from separate legal entities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, it would be appropriate to consider the availability of funding from the Applicant’s family members as a potential alternative source of funds. I reach this conclusion for several reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, there is evidence that the Applicant’s family members have access to large sums of money in other jurisdictions. The Applicant himself notes that his son Antonino possesses more than USD$10 million, transferred from Antonino’s BOS account to an account with Bank Sinarmas, which is not frozen nor subject to any investigations.

</div>
</div> Similarly, Irene states that the reason for the transfers made by the Applicant from his BOS account to Ivo’s Portuguese bank account in 2018 and 2020, totalling approximately €5 million, is that “Ivo required a reinforcement of <span class="font-italic">additional</span> funds to invest as at that time, Ivo’s own funds were already in investments and he did not have any liquid cash available to make further investments [emphasis added]”.

</div> This suggests that even prior to the transfer of €5 million, Ivo already had investments of his own. Moreover, even though the Applicant asserts that his family’s Portuguese bank accounts have been frozen, it is not clear whether the freezing orders would have any actual effect on the family’s ability to access the sum of more than €6 million transferred in total by the Applicant. No information has been provided as to how much money remained in the Portuguese bank accounts at the time they were frozen. No information has been provided as to when the freezing orders were made, which could very well have been a significant amount of time after the original transfers. No information has been provided as to whether the Applicant’s family members have bank accounts in other jurisdictions. Mr Thio was also unable to confirm or deny whether there were any outgoing transactions from the Portuguese bank accounts between the time of these injections and their alleged freezing. There is a considerable possibility that substantial sums had been transferred out of the Portuguese bank accounts prior to the freezing orders being made. Thus, I consider there is sufficient evidence that the Applicant’s family has access to funds which would be more than sufficient to cover the legal expenses that the Applicant is seeking reimbursement for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, there is a high likelihood that the assets of the Applicant’s family would be made available to the Applicant should he require access to funds. Given that the source of much of the wealth of the Applicant’s family came from transfers from the Applicant himself for their own investments and savings,

</div>
</div> But asserting the absence of a strict legal obligation for someone to pay for a family member’s legal costs is not the same as proving that they are unwilling or unlikely to do so. Here, there is sufficient <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence that the Applicant’s family are able, and likely willing, to extend funding to him. That they are not legally liable for such expenses is irrelevant to the question of whether they would in fact extend funding to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to expect the Applicant to explore the possibility of seeking funds from his family. They have access to sufficient assets to pay his legal fees without undue hardship to themselves. These assets were gifted by the Applicant himself. There is good reason for them to be inclined to extend funding to him. There is no evidence that they are unable or unwilling to do so. I thus find that requesting for funds from his family should be considered one of the alternative sources of funding that the Applicant ought to exhaust before release of the Seized Funds be deemed necessary. There is no evidence that he has exhausted that option. Making such a request would not cause undue hardship to the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the reasons above, I find that there is a significant degree of uncertainty as to whether the Applicant has other assets of his own that are available to him for the purposes of funding his legal expenses. Even if he does not, the Applicant has failed to show that alternative sources of funding from his family are unavailable. It is thus unnecessary for the Seized Funds to be released to pay for legal expenses in Singapore to prevent undue hardship to the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Exclusivity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 My conclusion that the release of the Seized Funds is unnecessary is further strengthened by the fact that the legal fees for which release is sought are not incurred exclusively by the Applicant. A striking feature of the invoices issued by TSMP in respect of the Singapore proceedings is that they were addressed, not to the Applicant personally, but to the Applicant’s family. The invoice was titled “Advice in relation to the bank accounts of Carlos Manuel De Sao Vicente, Irene Alexandra Da Silva Neto, Ivo Emanuel Neto De Sao Vicente, Antonino Neto De Sao Vicente and Felicia Neto De Sao Vicente”.

</div> It is clear that the references to Irene and Ivo extend beyond their assistance in the Applicant’s matter, to matters where they are the client. This is clear from the fact that legal services rendered to Irene and Ivo are billed separately from the Applicant, although these services both involve correspondence with the CAD.

He submitted that the larger point was that the bulk of the work was primarily done for the Applicant. Only a small percentage of work had been done for the Applicant’s family, most of which was duplicative of work that had already been done for the Applicant as the nature of proceedings was similar. However, this submission overlooks the distinction between who work was done for, and who would be expected to make payment for that work. The two are not the same, and often may involve different individuals within a familial context. In the absence of any submissions or evidence led as to how the payment was to be divided between the five named individuals on the invoice, the most natural inference would be that the invoice was intended to bill the family as a collective unit, rather than the Applicant specifically. Given my conclusion at [59] that the Applicant’s family has more than sufficient assets for this purpose, this provides a further reason why it would be not be unjust for the funds of the Applicant’s family as a whole to be considered part of the alternative sources of funding available for the Applicant to pay for the legal fees of TSMP.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Singapore proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Having found that the release of funds is unnecessary, it is not necessary for me to further consider the reasonableness of the quantum being claimed in respect of the Singapore proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Having regard to the interests of justice, I am strengthened in this conclusion by the presence of strong reasons as to why the release of the seized funds should not be taken lightly. There has been a determination by the Angolan courts that the Applicant has misappropriated state funds. These funds are traceable in part to the sums currently in his BOS account. He was not forthcoming in his answers to the CAD when explaining the source of his funds, even taking into account his limited access to information while incarcerated.

The fact that they have been engaged with litigation in other jurisdictions is insufficient to explain their delay of more than a year to respond to the CAD’s offer to conduct an interview via remote communication technology.

</div> Although the nature of their conduct should not in itself prejudice the assessment of the Applicant’s case, it is nevertheless relevant in pointing towards more time being needed for investigations due to a lack of information. A greater degree of caution would thus be appropriate before a decision to release the seized funds is made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the round, I am satisfied that denying the Applicant access to the funds sought for legal expenses arising from the Singapore proceedings would not cause undue hardship or injustice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proceedings in other jurisdictions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Given my finding that the Applicant has alternative sources of funding which he has failed to exhaust, I find that release of the Seized Funds is unnecessary for payment of legal expenses incurred in the Swiss and Angolan proceedings and in making representations to international organisations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Moreover, there are additional reasons why release of funds for the Swiss and Angolan proceedings in particular would not accord with the interests of justice in this case. For one, an appeal before the Swiss Federal Tribunal over the freezing order by the Geneva PPO is still pending (see [9] above). The decision could be reversed. In the absence of evidence as to why payment for the Swiss legal fees is time-sensitive, there are good reasons for waiting for the result of the pending appeal before allowing an application for release of seized funds. The same applies to the Angolan proceedings, which are also pending appeal.

The decision as to whether funds should be released for this representation would be best made by Swiss courts, who are better placed to make their own determination of the balance between the necessity of the freezing order and prejudice to the Applicant. In fact, the question of whether “irreparable harm would be caused to the holder of the sequestered assets” had already been canvassed before the Swiss courts.

</div> but this misses the point. Where there are sufficient assets seized in Switzerland for release to be sought for payment of legal expenses, such release ought to be sought from the seized Swiss funds, and the best adjudicator of whether that release can be made would be the Swiss courts. The same is true in Angola, where there are more than sufficient assets under a confiscation order for the issue to be best considered by an Angolan court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Lastly, although rendered irrelevant by my conclusion that release of the Seized Funds is unnecessary, I note for completeness that the scope of s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the CPC ought to include legal services rendered for proceedings out of jurisdiction. Observing the plain wording of s 35(8), there does not appear to be any reason for limiting the release of property under s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) to fees or expenses that are incurred in Singapore. Various kinds of expenses listed under s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) are capable of being incurred in multiple jurisdictions, such as where release is sought for payment of taxes or insurance premiums. Extraordinary expenses under s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) similarly do not seem amenable to such a geographical limitation. Even though s 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) limits the release of funds for day-to-day operations to companies incorporated in Singapore, this seems to be a particular feature of that specific subsection, as evidenced by the absence of similar wording elsewhere in s 35(8). Moreover, there are plausible reasons for the operations of Singaporean-incorporated companies to be regarded differently from foreign-incorporated companies, as information about these companies is more accessible to local courts, and cessation of their operations is more likely to have adverse effect on local supply chains, businesses, and employees. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I therefore dismiss the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Thio Shen Yi SC, Neo Zhi Wei Eugene and Phoon Wuei (TSMP Law Corporation) </span><div style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"><br/>for the app</div><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">lican</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">t;</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Alan Loh, Eric Hu and Daniel Ling <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(Attorney-General’s Chambers)</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">for the respondent.</span></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
