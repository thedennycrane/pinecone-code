Data centres must provide an uninterrupted electricity supply for the proper functioning of their customers’ IT equipment. It would be deleterious for their customers if electricity supply were to cease even for very short periods. Disruption is discussed in the context of milliseconds. Equally significant is the cooling capacity of the data space, which cannot fail for any sustained period of time (since failure would cause the sensitive IT equipment to overheat). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Data centres provide uninterrupted electricity supply and cooling through alternative back-up sources for no break power (“NBP”) and short break power (“SBP”). The essential difference is that SBP ordinarily experiences a short interruption of electricity of a few seconds during faults or maintenance.

</div> Because of this, mechanical equipment (such as chillers and Computer Room Air Conditioning units (“CRACs”), collectively known as the “Mechanical Load”) is typically supplied with SBP because it can tolerate short power disruptions, unlike IT equipment (also called the “IT Load”) that cannot. NBP is thus supplied for the IT Load. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Because an uninterrupted electricity supply is so crucial to the powering and cooling of their customers’ equipment, data centres install back-up electrical systems, in other words standby items of equipment that seamlessly “kick-in” and supply electricity the moment there is an interruption or anomaly in electricity supply coming off the power grid. Some of these back-up power systems can, to varying extents, “clean up” surges or drops in voltage, which occasionally occur in relation to the electricity coming off the power grid. Such anomalies are undesirable as they can interrupt the smooth functioning of IT equipment. I should mention that the frequency of alternating current from the grid (measured in Hertz (“Hz”)) can also fluctuate, although I am told that does not affect IT equipment.

If electricity supply is interrupted, the SUPS units “kick-in” and supply autonomous power to support the critical IT Load for around five to ten minutes. This buys time for the emergency generator to come online. SUPS systems can also condition the voltage input through a wide range of voltage deviation and act as a frequency converter.

</div> It does so without the use of batteries. Instead, there is one compact inline assembly, which can be containerised, comprising a kinetic energy accumulator (akin to a flywheel) which is coupled through induction to an inner rotor which drives the alternator, all of which are kept constantly spinning. That assembly is also connected to the diesel engine. The kinetic energy accumulator, in this case the outer rotor, spins continuously at 1,500 rpm. If there is any interruption or anomaly in the electrical supply, the diesel engine is activated, but meanwhile the interruption is momentarily taken up by the kinetic energy in the constantly spinning outer rotor which continues to drive the inner rotor and alternator thereby supplying the electricity (this being analogous to the battery function in the SUPS system).

Essentially this means providing back-up to the back-up, because an uninterrupted power supply is so critical to data centres. Data centres vary in terms of the level of redundancy provided. For instance:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In an “N+1” configuration, “N” is the number of items of standby equipment (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, generators or batteries combined with generators) required for emergency use when there is an interruption in electrical supply and “+1” represents an additional standby item of equipment for the redundancy capacity. If any of the “N” units fail, there is an additional unit to take its place. The “+1” is also useful when one of the “N” units have to be taken offline for maintenance or repairs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  In an “N+N” configuration, each generator is backed up by another generator, thereby ensuring that there is an equal number of backup generators available to take over the entire IT Load should all the main generators fail.

</div> A purpose-built steel structure was to be constructed at that location and upon which the three DRUPS units were to be placed. It appears, and this was not contradicted, that right from the start of the Project, AWP had ruled out constructing a platform for DRUPS units at a second location above the high voltage transformer and switchgear (“HV Transformer”) as it was considered too risky because piling would then have been required and it was the electrical supply point for both “A” and “B” 22 kV cables.

It is a question of balancing competing considerations. Generally speaking, giving more space to the equipment might mean cutting down on net floor area available for customer usage or, in this case, incurring higher costs for locating the DRUPS units in different locations. More relevantly, modern construction and technology would have made it possible to construct a platform for a DRUPS unit above the HV Transformer (as was in fact done later), but it would have incurred higher cost, required closer supervision during construction and entailed a longer time to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Around July to August 2008, Arup was looking to place three containerised DRUPS units at the assigned location at L2.

</div> Exactly what this meant will be examined later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Emails then passed between GSS and Arup on how much more power could be obtained from the DRUPS units by checking on whether the power factor could be increased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The power factor is technically the ratio of kW to kVA, which means the ratio of real power to apparent power. When I clarified this aspect with the expert witnesses, what this means, and I so find, is that first, when a manufacturer says its unit can provide 1,000 kW, it also stipulates the application of a power factor, say 0.8. This means if their unit runs at its fullest or highest capacity, it can provide 1,000 kW, but units are not meant to run flat out at full capacity for prolonged periods and purchasers should count on 800 kW (1,000 kW x 0.8) as the normal output. Further, it may also be the case that with age or sub-optimal maintenance, the power output may decline. However, in case of emergencies or for short periods or bursts of maximum capacity, it may possibly produce slightly more than 1,000 kW. For example, the Piller DRUPS units could run at 10% overload for one hour.

</div> Secondly, in reality, manufacturers add an additional safety margin or layer of protection to prevent claims for breach of specifications.

</div> GSS disputes that it made any variation to its requirements. Arup alleges that the 2,500 kVA DRUPS unit was the largest available at that point in time and GSS knew the NBP per unit was 1,400 kW. GSS disagrees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 At some point in time after 30 October 2009, it appeared that Microsoft was prepared to take up the whole Extension. With Microsoft’s requirement of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, 4,000 kW NBP for the IT Load, GSS (including their project consultants like T&amp;T) and Arup began discussing how the shortfall could be met. It was then decided that three DRUPS units would be used as the “N” component and the “+1” component would come from the spare capacity of the SUPS system in the Existing Facility (the “Revised Design”). Again there are differing implications, allegations and claims in relation to the need for, design and implementation of the Revised Design and my use of the phrase “then decided” is to be taken in a neutral manner as I will examine in detail later and make my findings as to whether, for example, GSS was “forced” to accept this solution because Arup failed to provide for 4,000 kW in the circumstances that occurred or GSS agreed to the Revised Design as a result of factors for which no blame could be attached to Arup.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Arup then proceeded to implement the Revised Design. This included the use of:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) thirty Power Distribution Units (“PDUs” or “PDU” as the case may be), where each PDU provided a “preferred” electrical feed from one of the three DRUPS units (the “Preferred Source”) and an “alternative” electrical feed from a group of SUPS units (the “Alternative Source”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Static Transfer Switches (“STSs” or “STS” as the case may be), which controlled the Preferred Source and the Alternative Source to each PDU so that during a fault or maintenance of a single DRUPS unit, the STS would transfer the electrical load of a PDU from the DRUPS unit to the SUPS system.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Microsoft moved into the Extension in tranches. It first occupied L3–L4 in September 2010 in phase 1 (after testing and commissioning (“T&amp;C”) was carried out from 14–15 August 2010) and L5–L7 in subsequent phases 2 to 4.

GSS complains that on this date the utility mains power supply experienced a disturbance and before the DRUPS units could react to supply the electrical power to the IT Load while the mains supply was unstable, the STSs transferred the electrical load of two DRUPS units to the SUPS units, resulting in overloading of the SUPS units and failure of the IT equipment of some of GSS’s tenants. GSS alleges that this caused them to breach their Service Level Agreements with those tenants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 GSS also complains that on or around 18 May 2013, the incoming feeders from the utility main power supply experienced disturbances and the STSs unnecessarily transferred the electrical loads of the DRUPS units to the SUPS units thereby causing a failure of their tenants’ IT equipment, and again causing GSS to breach their Service Level Agreements with those tenants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As a consequence, GSS alleged it had to install a fourth DRUPS unit and implement a distributed redundant re-configuration in the Extension. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46  Following from these events, which I will collectively refer to as the “May 2013 failures”, GSS sued Arup claiming substantial damages in excess of $23.8 million, general damages, interest, costs and an indemnity. Arup denied liability and filed a counterclaim for the balance of its fees.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I preface this section with my observation that parties have repeatedly gone beyond (and accused each other of going beyond) their respective pleaded cases. The general rule is that parties are bound by their pleadings and the court may not decide on a matter that the parties themselves have decided not to put into issue. But the court need not adopt an overly formalistic approach; departures are warranted in limited circumstances when no prejudice is caused to the other party. For instance, evidence given at trial can overcome defects in pleadings as long as the other party is not taken by surprise (see <span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam </span><span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [38]–[40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Following this approach, I will address the parties’ departures from pleadings where these are material to the issues before me and little or no prejudice is occasioned to the other party. In this case, many of the parties’ departures from pleadings concern issues that ended up being explored, sometimes extensively, in cross-examination (see in particular, the parties’ cases at trial on T&amp;C). It is also significant that the parties have submitted a list of 46 agreed issues; GSS have listed out a further 9 issues (which have been further broken down into 18 sub-issues), and Arup have listed out a further 23 issues (which have been further broken down into 4 sub-issues). Given that these various lists were drafted by and discussed between the parties’ lawyers, and accompanied the opening statements given in the course of trial, either party may be hard put to claim it was taken by surprise if some of the issues in these lists are addressed, although these would, on a strict reading, stray beyond the pleadings. That said, most of the issues in the agreed list would fall within the scope of the pleadings on a broad and charitable reading of the latter. However, it is another matter if a new area is explored after witnesses have completed their evidence in an earlier tranche. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I point out, however, that some of the issues in the agreed list of issues are worded too widely to be of assistance to the court. For example, two agreed issues were: “What were the terms of the Agreement between [GSS] and [Arup]?” and “Whether there were any implied terms in the Agreement”. It would have been appropriate to frame issues more narrowly, such as by identifying <span class="font-italic">specific</span> terms that allegedly formed part of the contract (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a term for fitness for purpose). For that reason, I find it preferable to take the pleadings as my starting point, and it is to those I now turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">GSS’s statement of claim</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The alleged obligations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 GSS avers that it was an express or implied term of the Contract that Arup was to design an electrical system, comprising DRUPS units in an “N+1” configuration, that delivered at least 4,000 kW of uninterruptible and continuous power (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, NBP) to critical IT equipment of GSS’s customers (“the IT Load Requirement”).

This is because Arup did not ensure that elements of the Revised Design – the DRUPS units, SUPS units, and STSs – were properly coordinated. Consequently, during the power disturbances on 2 and 18 May 2013, the STSs transferred excessive electrical load from DRUPS units to the SUPS units, which led to the failure of IT equipment of some of GSS’s clients.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Generally, I found that the parties’ factual witnesses were by and large honest witnesses who tried to recall, to the best of their respective abilities, events that occurred many years ago (in 2008–2010). I will comment on their evidence individually at appropriate junctures and whether or not I accept their evidence on a point and the reasons for doing so, especially where their loyalties to their respective organisations overrode their objectivity and the objective evidence. However, I must mention my findings on three important witnesses, Mr Paddy, Mr Turvey, and Mr Adcock. I note that Mr Paddy and Mr Adcock, were no longer employed by GSS and Arup respectively by the time they deposed their AEICs and gave evidence on the stand. Both Mr Paddy and Mr Adcock were upfront about not being able to recall certain details due to the passage of time. Further, they were generally not hesitant to admit that their recollections might be wrong when they were shown documents which contradicted their versions of events. However: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Paddy sometimes took positions in his evidence that were indefensible. I therefore do not accept all that he says and I make reference to these instances in the sections below. Many of these instances unfortunately relate to fairly crucial points; to take just one example (and I must say there are more than one), he was forced to admit in going through document after document, that he saw the figures of NBP from the DRUPS units under consideration at 1,400 kW NBP per unit, right from end June 2008 into the first quarter of 2010. He was naturally inclined to say what he could that would protect GSS’s position.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Turvey at times refused to accept that his evidence was contradicted by contemporaneous documents, for example, despite the emails within his own organisation showing the application of a diversity factor by multiplication, continued to insist it should be applied by division. For someone in his position and with his intelligence to do so considerably damages his credibility. I therefore found his evidence less reliable in quite a few respects.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I derived assistance from the evidence of both technical experts (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Ansett and Mr Peck). They were both willing and able to reach a consensus on various technical issues where they could. To varying degrees between them, they were also open to changing their views when shown to be wrong, admitting to mistakes in their calculations, or accepting qualifications to their theories. Where their evidence differed, I generally preferred the evidence of Mr Peck, whom I found more practical and whose evidence was backed up by close reasoning and a credible basis; he was also more objective and non-partisan, for example:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) accepting candidly that Arup providing 2,800 kW as against the figure of 3,600 kW was a “big difference”;

</div> Thus, Arup submits that it was clear that parties intended to incorporate the ACEA Short Form of Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 GSS submits that Arup should not be allowed to rely on its previous course of dealings with GSS to clarify the meaning of “ACEA Form Contract”, because it had failed to specifically plead the same in its Defence and Counterclaim. GSS claims that it has been prejudiced by this failure to plead – it would have otherwise adduced evidence of parties’ intentions in relation to these prior dealings and the consistency in or frequency of these dealings. GSS also points out that Arup has not demonstrated that the ACEA Short Form of Contract is incorporated as a matter of standard industry practice for data centre design consultants.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The question of whether a particular clause was incorporated by reference is a matter of contractual interpretation, and in undertaking this exercise, the court must have regard to the context and the objective circumstances attending the entry into the contract:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">International Research Corp PLC v Lufthansa Systems Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and another </span>[2014] 1 SLR 130 at [34]. In the context of the building and construction industry, the court may even interpret a reference to a non-existent form to mean a reference to the correct form, where there is evidence that the correct form is a document which both parties are aware of and recognise, and would normally expect to be included: see <span class="font-italic">Newcon Builders Pte Ltd v Sino New Steel Pte Ltd</span> [2015] SGHC 226 at [59], referring to <span class="font-italic">Modern Building Wales Ltd v Limmer &amp; Trinidad Co Ltd</span> [1975] 1 WLR 1281 (“<span class="font-italic">Modern Building</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Modern Building</span>, for example, the main contractor’s order to the subcontractor required them to supply labour plant and machinery in full accordance “with the appropriate form for nominated sub-contractors (R.I.B.A. 1965 edition)”. This was an inaccurate description of the standard form sought to be incorporated as there was no such RIBA Subcontract form. But <span class="font-italic">uncontroverted expert evidence</span> – which is absent on the facts in our case – was led which showed that persons in the construction industry would have understood the term in question to refer to a F.A.S.S. “Green Form”, a subcontract published by another body for use with the RIBA conditions. The Court therefore decided to ignore the factually inaccurate reference to the RIBA Subcontract form, and held that the remaining words of the incorporating clause were sufficient to incorporate the F.A.S.S Green Form. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 However, where a party seeks to rely on the surrounding factual context in support of its construction of the contract (including, as in this case, prior course of dealing), that party must specifically plead each fact that it wishes to rely on and the effect which such facts will have on its contended construction: <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another and another appeal </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 at [73]; Supreme Court Practice Directions, para 35A(2). In the present case, Arup has failed to specifically plead its previous course of dealings with GSS, even though this forms the factual context which it relies on in support of its interpretation of the term “ACEA Form Contract”. GSS’s objections are valid and Arup is precluded from relying on such evidence as a basis for its contention that the ACEA Form Contract was incorporated into their Agreement with GSS. Indeed, as noted above, Arup did not even plead that it was the ACEA <span class="font-italic">Short</span> Form of Contract which was incorporated into the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Leaving aside the point on pleadings, another possible route for the ACEA Form of Contract to be incorporated into the parties’ Agreement may be through GSS’s unqualified acceptance of Arup’s Fee Proposal. GSS never queried Arup on its reference to the ACEA Form of Contract, especially when it was not annexed to the Fee Proposal, although non-inclusion by itself was not fatal (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Press Automation Technology Pt</span><span class="font-italic">e Ltd v Trans-Link Exhibition Forwarding Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 712 <span class="font-italic">(</span>“<span class="font-italic">Press Automation</span>”))<span class="font-italic">.</span> However, the facts of <span class="font-italic">Press Automation </span>can be distinguished on the facts since the standard form contract sought to be incorporated in that case was clearly referred to, in contrast with cl 8, which does not specify which version of the ACEA Form Contract was sought to be incorporated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In <span class="font-italic">RI International Pte Ltd v Lonstroff AG </span>[2015] 1 SLR 521 (“<span class="font-italic">R1 International</span>”), a buyer purchased rubber from a seller on the international commodities market in five separate transactions over the course of a year. Each of these transactions proceeded in a similar fashion. Essentially, after the parties conclude their negotiations, the seller would send the buyer “email confirmations” setting out the basic terms that the parties have agreed upon. The buyer would then respond with a purchase order setting out the same. Thereafter, the seller would send the buyer a detailed contract note with a request that the buyer countersign the contract note and return a copy. The rubber would then be delivered and an invoice would be issued. Each contract note stated, amongst other terms, that the International Rubber Association Contract for “Technically Specific Rubber” would apply (“the IRAC Terms”).The IRAC Terms provided for disputes to be resolved by arbitration, with the second to fifth transactions providing for arbitration in Singapore. The buyer accepted delivery and paid for the rubber without protest in all five transactions, even though it did not countersign or return a copy of the contract note. A dispute regarding the second transaction and the buyer commenced proceedings against the seller. The seller commenced proceedings in Singapore, seeking an anti-suit injunction against the buyer for breaching the agreement to arbitrate in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 One issue that arose was whether the IRAC Terms had been incorporated into the contract. The Court of Appeal held at [51], that this “turned on ascertaining the parties’ objective intentions gleaned from their correspondence and conduct in light of the relevant background as disclosed by the evidence. The relevant background includes the industry in which the parties are in, the character of the document which contains the terms in question as well as the course of dealings between the parties”. In concluding that the IRAC Terms were incorporated into the contract, it is important to note that the Court of Appeal took into account the practice in the international rubber commodities market for parties to contract on standard terms, the fact that the buyer was known in the rubber trade, the size and scope of the subject matter of the relevant transaction, the matters dealt with by the IRAC terms and the parties’ conduct throughout the course of the five transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 This case is distinguishable from the present dispute in two regards. First, the seller relied on the trade custom in the rubber commodities market and alternatively a previous course of dealing. Both of these matters were properly in issue and the relevant evidence was placed before the court; this is unlike the present dispute before me. Secondly, the silence from the buyer may not, by itself, constitute acceptance of the terms by the other party; silence was therefore not necessarily fatal that the terms had been accepted. The effect of silence is very context-dependent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 <span class="font-italic">Hyder Consulting (Aust) Pty Ltd v Wilh Wilhelmsen Agency Pty Ltd </span>[2001] NSWCA 313 (“<span class="font-italic">Hyder Consulting”</span>) involved a dispute between the owner and its consultants in a redevelopment project. The owner sued its architect for not passing relevant loading information for the pavement to the engineer when the owner decided to use larger forklifts and its engineer for making insufficient enquiries of its own as to what weights the pavement was expected to bear. As far as the engineer was concerned, the relevant issue was whether the ACEA conditions had been incorporated into their contract, which would have enabled the engineer to avail itself of the limitation of liability in those conditions as to amount and duration. In this case, the architect, on behalf of the owner, had written to the engineer with drawings, design documentation, reports and documents, asking for their proposals and fee submission for engineering services. The engineer responded and also stated: “We propose that our appointment be in accordance with the ACEA Conditions of Engagement.” The architect, on behalf of the owner, confirmed the engagement of the engineer in accordance with its request to the engineer and the engineer’s offer of services. The engineer never forwarded a copy of the ACEA Conditions nor did the owner or architect exert themselves to obtain a copy. That subject was never mentioned subsequently by anyone to anyone else. The New South Wales Court of Appeal held that when engineering services were provided and the benefit of the services had been taken by the owner, there was acceptance of the services on the terms and conditions offered by the engineer, including the ACEA terms. Where an offeree takes the benefit of a contract in circumstances indicating that the offeror be paid in accordance with the offer, the inference is open that the offer was accepted according to its terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 It is important to note however that expert evidence was led in <span class="font-italic">Hyder Consulting </span>to the effect that the ACEA conditions of engagement were recognised in the industry and were the most used standard conditions of engagements of engineers and others. Also, the owner assumed that they would be subject to the conditions whether or not they received the ACEA conditions. <span class="font-italic">Hyder Consulting</span> is therefore of little assistance to Arup.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In the present case, the evidence showed there was more than one type of ACEA Form Contract. Arup initially gave discovery of the 2009 ACEA short form, which was the wrong edition of the short form. The relevant edition (this being the 2007 ACEA short form) was produced later. Mr Adcock accepts that there is more than one type of ACEA Form Contract.

</div> In Arup’s Defence and Counterclaim, it pleads in the alternative that it does not owe a duty of care which is wider than what was in the Fee Proposal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 It is possible for identical duties to exercise care and skill to exist in both contract and tort between the same parties, as a relationship of proximity may arise by virtue of the contract and the work to be performed under it, unless of course the contract expressly excludes a duty of care, or where the contractual framework is structured to demonstrate that the parties intended thereby to exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care: see <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap </span>at [20].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I am satisfied that, applying the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100, Arup owed GSS a duty of care in tort. First, on the threshold requirement, it would have been clearly foreseeable and obvious to Arup that GSS would suffer losses from its (Arup’s) carelessness. Secondly, there is legal and circumstantial proximity as Arup was engaged by GSS to be the M&amp;E consultant of the Project. Additionally, Arup accepts that it held itself out as experienced in providing data centre solutions, being technically sophisticated and employing technically qualified people. Thirdly, I do not find any policy considerations which could negate the existence of a duty of care in tort. There is also nothing in the Fee Proposal which expressly or implied excludes a concurrent duty of care in tort.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 It is trite that the applicable standard for determining whether a professional had breached its duty of care to its client is that of a reasonably competent practitioner in the profession concerned (<span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Liability </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Powell</span>”) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2017) at para 9-099). Thus, Arup’s duty was, as submitted by GSS, a general duty to carry out its express duties under the Contract with the standard of care, skill and diligence expected of a reasonably competent M&amp;E consultant. This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s observation at [19] of <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap</span> that “[a] duty of care in the tort of negligence… is necessarily a broad duty to take such care as is reasonable in the circumstances” and that “[m]atters of detail are best treated as part of the question of breach, not as raising sub-duties with a specific content”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Additionally, this reasonably competent M&amp;E consultant against whom Arup’s conduct is being judged must be one that also possesses the same experience in the design of data centres as Arup does (see <span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell </span>at para 2-135). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 However, the existence of Arup’s duty in tort has little practical significance in this case. It is GSS’s case that Arup’s duty in tort is “co-extensive” to its duty under contract.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Preliminarily, it is unclear whether GSS is seeking to argue that the fitness for purpose term should be implied as a matter of law, or as a matter of fact. The authorities cited by GSS (a passage from Stephen Furst QC and Sir Vivian Ramsey, <span class="font-italic">Keating on Construction Contracts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2016) (“<span class="font-italic">Keating</span>”) at para 3-071, and the English case of <span class="font-italic">Greaves &amp; Co (Contractors) v Baynham Meikle &amp; Partners </span>[1975] 1 WLR 1095 (“<span class="font-italic">Greaves &amp; Co</span>”)) do not support the view that such a term should be implied as a matter of law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 First, the passage in <span class="font-italic">Keating </span>focuses on the implied obligation of <span class="font-italic">contractors</span>, and is silent on whether this implied obligation extends to designers or M&amp;E consultants. In this regard, I note that there is a general reluctance to extend that same implied obligation to professionals generally (see <span class="font-italic">George Hawkins v Chrysler (UK) and Burne Associates </span>(1986) 38 BLR 36 (“<span class="font-italic">George Hawkins</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Platform Funding Ltd v Bank of Scotland plc (formerly Halifax plc) </span>[2009] QB 426 at [16]-[19], [30], and [48]). As the authors of <span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell </span>note (at para 9-124): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There will be <span class="font-italic">no absolute answer</span> as to whether one who <span class="font-italic">designs but does not supply an article or build a structure </span>is under a duty to ensure that it is reasonably fit for its intended purpose, but such a duty will not be implied by law. It will therefore arise either on a true construction of the parties’ agreement or as an implication from the common intention of the parties. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Secondly, the court in <span class="font-italic">Greaves &amp; Co</span> made clear that the implied obligation found to have arisen on the facts was an implied term in fact, and not in law. All three judges emphasised that they were not laying down any general principle applicable to all contracts between designers and their employers (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Denning at 1100; <span class="font-italic">per </span>Browne LJ at 1102E–F; <span class="font-italic">per </span>Geoffrey Lane LJ at 1103E–F). Indeed, <span class="font-italic">Greaves &amp; Co</span> has been read narrowly by a differently constituted Court of Appeal in the subsequent case of <span class="font-italic">George Hawkins</span> (see <span class="font-italic">George Hawkins </span>at 48–49). In particular, Dillon LJ at 53 observed that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The general position, as [Fox LJ] has shown by reference to [<span class="font-italic">Greaves &amp; Co</span>] is that a professional man who is called to advise is bound, and impliedly undertakes, to use reasonable care and skill in advising, but is not responsible for providing a perfect result or a perfect building. <span class="font-italic">To establish a warranty that what he advises will be effective, something more is needed than his mere engagement as a professional man to advise</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125  I therefore decline to find any implied term in law because the threshold for implying such a term is a high one, and neither party has addressed me sufficiently on this. Thus, the only available avenue open to GSS is to show that a fitness for purpose warranty should be implied into the contract in fact. However, it has also not addressed me on whether the test for implying a term in fact as set out in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>(at [101]) is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In any case, I find that there is no such implied term in fact. When approaching this issue two questions arise: Fit for what purpose? And, “fit” to what standard? In the context of designing a data centre, the latter question is susceptible to numerous levels of quality and standards, such as the degree of redundancy – for instance, Mr Peck gave evidence of various options such as “N+N”, “N+2”, “N+25%”, or “N+1”.

Under this test, the court must consider: first, whether the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap; secondly, whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term to give the contract efficacy; and thirdly, whether the specific term to be implied is one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [101]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In relation to the first step, I find that the parties did not contemplate the question of whether Arup should be under a contractual warranty that its design would be fit for purpose. Both parties have not adduced any evidence to show that this issue was discussed during negotiations, nor do the express terms of the contract shed any light on this. However, an implied term for fitness for purpose would not have been necessary for business efficacy, because Arup would already be under a duty to use reasonable care and skill in performing its contractual obligations. The officious bystander test would also not have been met. Arup would not have agreed to guarantee more than the use of reasonable care and skill, considering its modest fee and the fact that it was to develop the design in close consultation with GSS. Accordingly, I reject GSS’s submission that it was an implied term of the Contract for Arup to ensure that its designs were fit for their intended purposes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What the Fee Proposal and Purchase Order provided for </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I now deal with the issue of what did the Fee Proposal (as accepted by the Purchase Order) provide for. This answers an agreed issue: what were Arup’s obligations to GSS under the Contract with respect to the IT load requirement? There are two facets to this, the first being Arup’s claim that the 4,000 kW of NBP for the IT load was “a target” or an “aspiration” and not a fixed contractual requirement, and the second relating to the parties’ disagreement on how the diversity factor is to be applied to the stipulated 4,000 kW.

</div> Leaving aside the application of diversity, it is clear, and it cannot really be in dispute that what GSS wanted was additional space in the Extension to let with an electrical system that provided 1 kW/m2 or a total of 4,000 kW for the IT Load (with an overall diversity of 0.9). That was, at the very least, the starting point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Arup, however, rely on the other provisions of the Fee Proposal to support their contention that the figure of 4,000 kW was not a fixed contractual requirement but some goal or something to work towards. Arup points to their stated work for the conceptual/preliminary design stage where their proposal was to “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Develop</span><span class="font-italic">, review </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and agree</span> the design brief to reflect the needs of [GSS]” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] (see [19(i)] above). Arup had stated in their Fee Proposal that this was one of the most critical stages of the Project as <span class="font-italic">a carefully developed and agreed</span> conceptual design would ensure the smooth running of all subsequent stages. Hence their design was not fixed at the Fee Proposal stage, but only at the end of the Conceptual/Preliminary Design stage, after their design criteria was agreed with GSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The following sub-paragraphs in the Fee Proposal tend to support Arup’s contention that the 4,000 kW was not a fixed contractual stipulation, in that it could be changed:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">establish and agree</span> electrical power density requirements for cabinet/racks, numbers and power consumption of cabinets/racks (at [19(iii)] above); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">establish</span> electrical capacity and cooling load requirements based on power densities <span class="font-italic">and agree</span><span class="font-italic">d</span> spare capacity for expansion (at [19(iv)]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">confirm</span> the levels of redundancy required for electrical and mechanical plant and distribution systems (“N+1”) (at [19(v)]); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">agree</span> the method of cooling (chilled water, cooling tower water, refrigerant). <span class="font-italic">Agree</span> DRUPS capacities and configurations (at [19(vi)]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Arup’s contention also rests on the words as set out in [19(i)]. Besides developing, reviewing and agreeing the design brief to reflect the needs of GSS, the Fee Proposal goes on to provide: “Designs shall be <span class="font-italic">based on design criteria</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">agreed with [GSS]</span> <span class="font-italic">to suit local conditions</span>, regulations and <span class="font-italic">any restrictions imposed by the building fabric, structure and infrastructure</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 What was the design brief that Arup promised to deliver? In my judgment, in relation to the power (and therefore the NBP) for the Extension, Arup was to propose and design an electrical system or scheme, comprising the necessary pieces of equipment and components, arranged in a proper sequence and layout, so as to deliver 4,000 kW (with an overall diversity of 0.9) for the IT Load in GSS’s proposed Extension which was for rental to tenants or customers. It also included a new chilled water system for the cooling load. It necessarily involved discussions with GSS to establish what it required and to agree the same – this is clear from the sub-paragraphs referred to above and at [19]; Arup then had to source the available suitable equipment and components, formulate a design or plan to link the equipment and components into a system (which included delivery of normal electricity from the power grid mains), to deliver what was required for the Extension. That was their design brief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I do not accept Arup’s contention that the 4,000 kW was a “target” or an “aspiration” that it would work towards. As a matter of construction, it is clear from the Fee Proposal that an Extension with 4,000 kW (with an overall diversity at 0.9), was the stipulated requirement of GSS that formed the basis of Arup’s design brief under their “scope” of work in their Fee Proposal, unless GSS wanted a change or agreed to a revision of that figure during the design development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 It is also clear that the stipulated power for the IT Load and Arup’s design elements could be affected by any restrictions imposed by the building fabric, structure and infrastructure and “to suit local conditions” under [19(i)]. Any decision thereon by Arup had to be agreed with GSS and their Project consultants. As we shall see below, space was tight, and there were limited areas where, in the view of the Project structural engineers, Babtie, and the Project architects, AWP, the DRUPS units for the Extension could be located. The other potential location above the HV Transformer was ruled out by Babtie and AWP. Just to give two examples that may also have caused changes to GSS’s requirements, first, there may have been cost constraints on the provision of four (which may have been ideal and catered for future requirements) instead of three DRUPS units; secondly, some larger capacity DRUPS units may not be suitable for local conditions as they did not operate at a frequency of 50 Hz. However, the burden of proving if there were any changes or decisions by GSS which altered their obligations set out under their Fee Proposal and accepted by GSS, rests on Arup.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Before I leave this issue, I point out that Arup’s Defence and Counterclaim, refers to the 4,000 kW as a “power <span class="font-italic">requirement</span>” [emphasis added] and not a target:

</div> Mr Peck took a different view. I formed the view that Mr Ansett proffered this rather partisan opinion without convincing reasons because he could not explain away the phrase being clearly stated in the parties’ agreement or the numerous emails and references in GSS contemporaneous documents as to:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the reason why a diversity factor was being applied; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the application of the diversity factor by GSS in the manner advocated by Arup, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by multiplying the 4,000 kW by the diversity factor.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I prefer Mr Peck’s view that diversity could be applied at the design stage, not only because it makes common and commercial sense but also because it is consistent with the many contemporaneous emails and documents, both from Arup as well as GSS, discussing its application in the manner pleaded by Arup. Mr Ansett appeared to be attempting to explain GSS’s position even though their pleaded case was <span class="font-italic">not</span> that a diversity factor should not be applied at the design stage but that it meant that Arup’s design was required to provide 4,000 to 4,444 kW for the Extension. Mr Peck was more practical in giving evidence that diversity could be applied at the design stage; to do so was a “bet” that customers would not use the full amount of their contracted NBP, which data centre operators might take to defer expenditure and save costs.

</div> I accept Mr Peck’s opinion, and note that the cost-saving approach he outlined coheres with the view I have reached of GSS’s approach to the Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I find that a diversity factor is applied because it is the experience of data centre operators that their tenants do not always take up all the contracted NBP for their leases. There are quite a number of emails and contemporaneous documents, especially those emanating from GSS and Global Switch, evidencing this. I need only pick up the following examples, one before the Fee Proposal and three that came after, to illustrate my finding. In my view, these emails are very telling in more ways than one because they are contemporaneous pieces of evidence of what GSS was thinking of at that time in relation to capital expenditure and the power they were willing to provide for the Extension.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Paddy’s email to Mr Adcock dated 29 August 2008

</div> Three things are of note. First, Mr Adcock stated that typically, banks who have up to seven IT platforms have an average load of 50 to 70% of their power contracted density (and GSS counted at least one bank in their Existing Facility). Secondly he warned that one must consider the peak loads of tenants like banks, at the end of the day, week or month. Thirdly, at the end of the day, the application of power diversity was not an engineering question but more of commercial management versus risk exercise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Having found that the diversity factor of 0.9 ought to be applied, I turn now to address the question of how the diversity factor ought to be applied. I note that in its reply closing submissions, GSS does not seriously dispute that the application of the diversity factor involves multiplying 4,000 kW (1 kW/m2 over 4,000m2) by 0.9 to arrive at 3,600 kW: it accepts that this is “technically correct”.

</div> This concession is unsurprising. When I specifically asked both experts during concurrent evidence as to what applying a diversity factor of 0.9 to 4,000 kW meant, both Mr Ansett and Mr Peck agreed that applying a 0.9 diversity factor to 4,000 kW of power would result in 3,600 kW.

</div> Mr Turvey was maintaining GSS’s pleaded case, unreasonably in my view, in spite of all the contemporaneous evidence against that construction. When GSS’s solicitor’s letter of demand to Arup dated 25 March 2013 (which stated that the NBP requirement was 3,600 kW) was put before him during cross-examination, he was forced to concede that he must have reviewed it, agreed to its contents and authorised the issue of that letter of demand and that he, as GSS Managing Director “must have acknowledged [3,600 kW] at the time.”

This was part of an email chain where GSS had ordered 2 HV panels (unconnected to the current disputes), but found they only needed one HV panel. Mr Paddy then asked Mr Adcock whether they could use the extra HV panel in the Extension, rather than incur cancellation charges. Mr Adcock replied that they could if the Extension went ahead. Mr Adcock wrote: “we would require this to serve 2No of the 3No 1670 kVA DRUPS required.

</div> Again this was a quote for three DRUPS units in an “N+1” configuration delivering 2,800 kW of NBP.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">There were also other emails with attachments containing the above information.

As dealt with below, I find that the three suppliers offered the largest suitable DRUPS units they had at that point in time. Further, when the capacity was found wanting, no one said there were higher capacity DRUPS units in the market. That would have been the most obvious solution. Also, if there were no constraints over cost or space, it would not make any sense for a consultant engineer in Arup’s position to <span class="font-italic">limit</span> his design in relation to the capacity and number of DRUPS units to be deployed. I asked both experts if they could think of a reason why a consultant engineer in Arup’s position would simply not suggest a larger capacity machine or if that was not available, to use four DRUPS units instead. They both could think of none. I was not surprised at their answer. Arup had nothing to gain, but indeed everything to lose, by putting forward three DRUPS units in an “N+1” configuration that could not achieve 3,600 kW when the obvious solution was to obtain a higher capacity DRUPS unit or, if that was not available, to use four DRUPS units instead. Arup’s fee was a fixed sum and suggesting a larger capacity DRUPS unit or a fourth would not have affected their fee. The only adverse consequence would be on GSS who would incur a higher capital expenditure.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 GSS attempts to put forward Mr Paddy as someone who is really an electrician and not an electrical engineer. Whilst this submission is made under adversarial licence, with respect, it does stretch that licence over the bounds of credibility. Mr Paddy does not have an engineering degree but he is someone with considerable knowledge of electrical matters built up over decades starting with the London Electricity Board. He has the advantage of practical know-how built from the ground up. His first experience with data centres was whilst working for M+W Zander in Global Switch’s Sydney site after which he joined Global Switch in September 2007.

</div> I do not accept his evidence on this point. Someone in Mr Paddy’s position in 2008 would have known basic concepts like NBP, SBP and diversity as applied in data centres. His knowledge of such concepts in late August 2008 is clear from his first draft of an internal paper which he asked Mr Adcock to look over and amend if necessary (see [146(a)] above). From my observation of his evidence under cross-examination, there was no misunderstanding of the questions being put to him and his answers were clear and unequivocal. To take just one example already referred to above, Mr Paddy was taken through the Piller quotation and he accepted it was for 1,750 kVA or 1,400 kW and accepted it was not for 3,600 kW; he was then referred to an email from Piller to him informing him that they were going to seek a re-pricing, again he agreed. He was forced to acknowledge the following:

</div> GSS was encouraged by Arup to make a decision speedily as the lead time for delivery of the DRUPS units was 30 to 32 weeks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Up to almost the end of November 2008, Mr Paddy, despite knowing that the EuroDiesel DRUPS units could only provide 1,400 kW of NBP and 600 kW of SBP, did not once object or point out that Arup had provided him with under-capacity or under-powered DRUPS units for their stipulated IT Load. I find that up to this stage, Mr Paddy was aware of the limitations of space (the non-availability of any other space, other than that above the HV Transformer, which had been ruled out by Babtie and AWP) and that the DRUPS manufacturers he had asked Arup to approach could not offer any larger capacity DRUPS units than those set out above. These were concerns and matters that he would have disagreed with if they did not fit GSS’s requirements for their data centre, unless Mr Paddy was very careless, totally ignorant about electrical matters, or went about his job in a most cavalier fashion. It would be unfair to ascribe any of these characteristics to him. But that would not be to say he was incapable of making mistakes.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 On 28 November 2008, Mr O’Brien, GSS’s then Managing Director (and Mr Turvey’s predecessor) sent Mr Paddy an email about the power he could sell in “the facility” in an email.

In plain English, I would have expected an expression like: “we <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">now</span> have back up in excess of 2,800 kW” or words to that effect. This can be contrasted to his second paragraph where Mr Paddy shows his concern over GSS requirements as being higher that the supply of 20 MW from the power mains, there he says: “We are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">now</span> exceeding 20MW” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 Significantly, there is also no evidence put forward as to what Mr Paddy did upon receiving Arup’s categorical answer of 2,800 kW NBP and what he reported back to Mr O’Brien’s query. This is important because Mr O’Brien wanted to know how much power he could sell in the Extension. Mr Paddy only stated in his AEIC at paragraph 45 that he “trusted that Arup would come up with the necessary solutions to meet Global Switch’s requirement”.

If indeed there was such an unauthorised shortfall from the required NBP, I find it hard to believe that this did not immediately become a red flag issue as between GSS (especially their sales division), and Arup. The question of NBP was asked by the GSS Managing Director, who wanted to know how much power GSS could sell. If GSS thought this was 4,000 kW with a diversity of 0.9 and a reply came back at 2,800 kW, one would expect, at the very least, some discussions between GSS, Mr Paddy and Arup to ensue. There is surprisingly <span class="font-italic">no evidence</span> put forward by GSS of Mr O’Brien’s reaction to what would have been alarming news.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 On the other hand, I have also borne in mind the absence of a lack of protest by Arup to the effect that, for example, it was constrained by GSS to achieve the stipulated 3,600 kW because it could only cater for three DRUPS units in the only designated place for such machines, there were no bigger capacity DRUPS units that were suitable and available and GSS ruled out the only other space available for a fourth DRUPS unit as being an unacceptable risk to construct a structure therefor and/or that GSS was not prepared to incur the cost of a fourth DRUPS unit. However, having watched Mr Adcock on the stand, I find he possesses a very mild character and is a gentle person; he is certainly not aggressive or assertive. I believe he did not adopt such a hard response to GSS because not only of his character, but because he would have been someone who wanted to preserve the relationship between himself and Arup as consultants, and the client. Mr Adcock was someone who had his eye firmly on completing the Project rather than engaging in pointing fingers and he believed Mr Paddy was well aware of the power output of the DRUPS units under consideration, which after all, were from manufacturers GSS itself had asked him to approach.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 On the contrary, after that statement of NBP of 2,800 kW from two DRUPS units, the evidence shows Mr Paddy exploring with Arup what possible solutions there were to “increasing” the NBP. On that very day, 28 November 2008, Mr Paddy asked Mr Adcock whether the DRUPS units could operate at a better power factor than 0.8.

It is clear that GSS was internally discussing the stipulated power and probably contemplating the latter. The suggestion of adding power at a later stage, when the demand for power from the tenants required it, was similar to GSS’s past strategy where it initially installed six generators when the Existing Facility was not fully occupied and had the option to add on generators in a “plug-and-play” model as and when more space was taken up by tenants (see [12]).

If this capital expenditure (including cost for construction complexities) for a fourth DRUPS unit was not a constraint, it would have occurred to someone, whether from GSS, Arup or GSS’s other consultants, to suggest installing a fourth DRUPS unit. Nor was there any suggestion to use a higher capacity DRUPS unit that could deliver more than 1,400 kW NBP. It was obvious from the Global Switch Directive in January 2009 and the exchange of emails between GSS and Arup thereafter, that GSS was not looking at adding another DRUPS unit but reducing the power sold to tenants possibly through diversity initiatives and/or reducing the number of DRUPS units.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 There was a further oral query raised by Mr Paddy on diversity at GSS on 10 February 2009.

He presciently noted that tenants like Microsoft with only one or two IT platforms would load their equipment up to the limit and then want more. From this email, Mr Adcock was clearly advising caution against applying diversity without considering the kinds of tenants and the typical loads those tenants have; emphasising the importance of looking at peak usages and not averages; and cautioning against banking on running the DRUPS units at 110% and that tenants would have the right, given the usually long leases, to take up the contracted loads by adding equipment as time goes on.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 On 17 February 2009, just over two weeks after Global Switch’s directive, GSS issued the Stop Work Order.

The company is generally risk averse to heavy investment without ensuring a return on the investment and, therefore, further discussions were being had with customers to ascertain the realism of it before investing in the project.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: It is only after some of those initial discussions start to bear fruit, or there is an indication of customer demand in around October 2009 that Global Switch re-engages the project, isn’t that correct?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: That’s correct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 In addition to my findings of fact above, I find that as of 17 February 2009, GSS had agreed with Arup to install only three EuroDiesel No Break KS-5 1,750/2,500 kVA, 400 V, 50 Hz DRUPS units in the Extension. GSS, working within their limitations of space and cost constraints, were prepared to accept 1,400 kW of NBP and 600 kW of SBP per DRUPS unit in an “N+1” configuration. I accept the submissions of Arup that GSS constrained the space that was available to place the DRUPS units: that space could only accommodate three DRUPS units. GSS through their consultants ruled out the only other suitable place where another DRUPS unit could be located, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, above the HV Transformer, as we shall see, the largest available and suitable DRUPS unit was capable of only delivering 1,400 kW NBP and 600 to 625 kW SBP. GSS through Mr Paddy knew about this and GSS had cost constraints in that it was risk averse to heavy investment without there being customer take-up. This was consistent with and borne out by the Global Switch Directive in January 2009 which requested for a thorough technical review of all spare capacity in their existing facilities, to innovatively re-distribute any spare power and cooling capacities to maximise revenues and to look at power diversity initiatives in all extension buildings. This is also borne out by Arup’s responses, set out at [198] and [200]–[201] above, when asked by GSS to respond to the Global Switch Directive for power diversity initiatives, using all spare power and not incurring any more capital expenditure in expansions without a business case.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Microsoft tenancy, resumption of the Project, and the Revised Design</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The discussion here answers, but is not limited to, the agreed issue of whether Arup’s provision of the Revised Design was a variation to the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 After the 17 February 2009 Stop Work Order, there were no developments of any note between GSS’s technical side and Arup, although there appears to be some expectation that the Project would be reactivated later in the year. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 In or around July 2009, Mr Paddy said GSS’s discussions with Microsoft and other potential tenants were showing promise. There is no other direct evidence as to exactly when this occurred and what exactly that meant. This then led to a reactivation of the Project.

The comparison table also stated that the “Critical Load (No Break) Rated Output” of the Hitec, Piller and EuroDiesel DRUPS units was 1,400 kW. It would not require much arithmetic to conclude that the use of three such DRUPS units in an “N+1” configuration, meant that the total NBP would be 2,800 kW (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 1,400 kW × 2). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 It is important to note that Mr Paddy had also asked Mr Adcock to investigate whether GSS could rely on the Existing Facility’s spare power to satisfy the Extension’s NBP requirements.

This would not be the case if Microsoft took up the whole Extension and required 4,000 kW of NBP.

As pointed out above, Mr O’Brien’s query on 28 November 2008 as to how much power he could sell in the Extension and Mr Adcock’s clear reply on that same day, sent to Mr Paddy, somehow failed to get transmitted to or register with GSS’s business team. GSS’s business team had sold the Extension’s available NBP to Microsoft at 4,000 kW. The mismatch between what was required of Arup in the Fee Proposal, what the technical team on the ground was discussing with Arup before Microsoft came to look at leasing the whole Extension, and what power was sold to Microsoft, is obvious. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 Having been informed of Microsoft’s requirements, Mr Paddy proceeded to ask Mr Adcock to investigate whether the Extension was able to deliver the 4,000 kW of NBP that Microsoft needed.

</div> This contrasts with the situation in 2010, where there was no clear indication that GSS needed more than 4,000 kW of NBP for the Extension. As mentioned above, GSS’s attitude in 2010 was that additional capital expenditure would only be justified if there was a clear demand for it. This would tie in with my observations above (at [28]) on the possibility of installing a fourth DRUPS unit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Variation to 4,000 kW of NBP and incorporation of STSs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 With the securing of Microsoft as a tenant for the whole Extension, GSS faced a significant problem. Whatever case GSS may have tried to run at trial, the fact of the matter is, as I have found, that GSS only asked for an Extension with 3,600 kW NBP under the Contract. I also have found that GSS knew what it was doing when stipulating 4,000 kW with a 0.9 diversity. This is a key point. Even if I am wrong in finding that the 3,600 kW requirement was varied to 2,800 kW such that Arup breached the Fee Proposal in providing for 2,800 kW (instead of 3,600 kW of NBP in an “N+1” configuration), Arup never promised 4,000 kW of NBP, something which GSS now had to deliver to Microsoft.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 It is noteworthy that Mr Paddy admitted in cross-examination that GSS had asked Arup to provide for more power when GSS found it needed 4,000 kW for the Microsoft lease; Mr Paddy also accepted that GSS had also asked Arup to incorporate the use of STSs in its Revised Design:

However, there were a number of issues associated with this option, including the cost of approximately $4.5 million, and the spatial constraints of the Tai Seng site. It was also noted that the only viable location for a fourth DRUPS unit was above the HV Transformer substation, and that “the amount of in ground services would make any new structure very difficult to construct”. Nevertheless, it was concluded that the installation of a fourth DRUPS unit was a viable option which could be instigated if the Revised Design proved to be unviable, or if there was a need for increased capacity in the future.

GSS also obtained opinions from Babtie and AWP (at [27] and [139]) ruling out the availability of space for a fourth DRUPS unit. In other words, GSS was not an uninformed party and the situation is far from that of a professional warning a lay client or laying out the options. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Mr Peck, when questioned on whether a consultant who knew that 3,600 kW could not be obtained should have brought the issue expressly to the client’s attention, agreed that this should be done and “brought to the client’s attention more emphatically”.

The software was developed by the manufacturer of the STSs (Cyberex), with supply, installation and T&amp;C done by Technology Recovery &amp; Development (S) Pte Ltd (“TRADS”).

According to Mr Hamer, the voltage dip caused the DRUPS to engage. The transfer of the load to the DRUPS resulted in a slight deviation in the frequency of the DRUPS’s output power. Because this deviation in frequency fell outside the STSs’ parameters, the STSs mistook this frequency deviation as a fault and transferred the IT Load from the Preferred Source (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the DRUPS), to the Alternative Source (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the SUPS), thereby overloading the SUPS.

This means his conclusion is premised on the assumption that the test scenarios he conducted accurately replicated the sequence of events on those two occasions.

The test alerted Mr Hamer to an out-of-frequency condition that had occurred during the May 2013 failures, and how the STSs transferred due to the DRUPS. The bypass test would also have provided Arup with an additional opportunity to discover the frequency issue in the Revised Design. Both experts agreed that a reasonably competent consultant should have recommended the bypass test, and that this was part of the standard basic tests of the T&amp;C procedure.

</div> Therefore, while the <span class="font-italic">reason</span> for the STSs initiating a transfer would differ for the May 2013 failures and the bypass test, the <span class="font-italic">result</span> would be the same in that the STSs would identify a frequency anomaly and react by transferring from their Preferred Source to their Alternative Source. The bypass test would therefore have alerted Arup to the problem because the STSs are not meant to initiate a transfer under such conditions.

</div> But the experts did not go so far as to say that this was something too risky to be done; indeed such a pairing was done in GSS’s Sydney facility. I find that being “careful” in this context simply means that Arup should have thought through the processes involved, as well as carried out proper T&amp;C of any proposed system with a DRUPS unit and STS pairing, to acquire the necessary knowledge or understanding about whether there was a problem with that system.

First, this requirement for an additional 10% buffer was not pleaded by GSS or mentioned anywhere in its opening statement or AEICs. Instead, GSS appears to base this argument on what Mr Ansett said during his oral testimony. I note that Mr Ansett did not even mention the need to factor in a 10% buffer in his expert report. Allowing GSS to rely on this at this late stage would cause prejudice to Arup as its expert would not have had adequate opportunity to consider the issue before taking the stand.

</div> Mr Chia, correctly in my view, objected to much of Mr Hamer’s evidence as opinion evidence. It would have been very different if Mr Hamer or Mr Turvey gave evidence of what GSS did to remedy the shortfall, the cost incurred for such rectification, along with proof or quotes and relevant details. It would then be open to the experts to opine if the remedial measure was correct and/or reasonable and give their views, perhaps with input from a cost consultant/quantity surveyor, on the amount incurred. The point remains that Mr Hamer did not properly explain how he derived this scheme. After stating that there was a shortfall in cooling capacity he claimed that “[he] was instructed to devise solutions to make up this shortfall”, and that <span class="font-italic">“[p]</span><span class="font-italic">lans </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">are being considered</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>at the moment but it is <span class="font-italic">very likely that [GSS] </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">will have to incur</span><span class="font-italic"> significant costs</span> to install a fourth chiller unit and additional CRACs”[emphasis added in italics and bold italics].

</div> I find that Mr Hamer’s proposed rectification scheme, much like his proposal in relation to isolation valves, cannot be said to be a reliable measure with a sound technical basis. Mr Hamer’s other evidence also suffers from similar shortcomings in straightforward factual matters. To pick another example, GSS complains about Arup’s failure to provide a reasonable means of access to the DRUPS units (see above at [64(a)]). Mr Hamer then states that a proper set of stairs (as opposed to a cat ladder) should be installed and he <span class="font-italic">estimates</span> the cost therefor at $65,000, which estimate is based on the cost of stairs that were installed by another contractor for another project. There were no quotations or even details of the other stairs installed provided by GSS to fulfil its burden of proving its damage.

</div> This claim was abandoned by GSS in their closing submissions. For these reasons, I decline to give any weight to Mr Hamer’s proposed rectification scheme for the cooling shortfall. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">372 That GSS has not acted quickly to implement this scheme also raises questions about the genuineness of the proposed scheme. Given how critical cooling is to the Extension, one would have expected such rectification works to have been conducted expediently upon discovering the problem. According to Mr Turvey, GSS approached T&amp;T in 2014 to prepare a cost estimate on the necessary measures to resolve the cooling issue.

The question then becomes how sure GSS is of that party entering into the contract, and the factual issues that would have arisen in both a loss of profit and loss of chance claim in the context of this case would be largely the same – essentially, whether GSS could have realistically accommodated either Pacnet’s or Microsoft’s requests for more power in the Existing Facility.

As Mr Turvey accepted, over and above being able to deliver additional power to the respective suites, GSS also had to ensure that there was sufficient space and cooling to accommodate Pacnet’s additional power requirements.

On 11 July 2011, he emailed Mr Turvey stating that Pacnet’s total requirement for 255 kW might be more than the total spare SUPS capacity that GSS had, and that GSS could only provide Pacnet with a total of 131 kW.

In his view, the capital expenditure needed for this opportunity would have been significantly lower if GSS had been able to cable the additional power from a single location in the Existing Facility. However, because available SUPS power had been diverted to the Extension, GSS would have had to cable it from various SUPS units scattered around the Existing Facility, which was expensive.

It attributes this high price to the fact that GSS was forced to source for additional power from multiple locations in the Existing Facility, which necessitated significant capital expenditure and therefore prevented GSS from making a competitive offer to Pacnet.

</div> However, given the emphasis that Pacnet placed on pricing in its email of 25 September 2011, I do not think these other concerns would have been insurmountable if GSS had been able to quote a lower price. I also disagree with Arup that Pacnet’s refusal of GSS’s discounted second offer suggests that its first refusal had nothing to do with price.

</div> Even though GSS had reduced the price of its second offer, there is no indication that this reduction caused the offer to become significantly more competitive to Pacnet; its competitors might still have been offering much lower prices on more favourable terms. The reality was that GSS could not meet Pacnet’s expectations of a reasonable cost for its requirements. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Arup’s responsibility for high capital expenditure </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">412 However, GSS has failed to show that the high capital expenditure was a result of Arup’s breaches. In particular, GSS has not shown that the entirety of the high capital expenditure was attributable to Arup rather than to the major upgrading works that had to be undertaken regardless of Arup’s Revised Design. Mr Turvey accepted that GSS needed to undertake more than just cabling works (arising from Arup’s Revised Design) in order to provide the additional power to Pacnet.

</div> These would have cost a significant amount of money and may well have prevented GSS from presenting a competitive offer to Pacnet. Mr Turvey’s email of 5 September 2011, which stated that the estimated cabling costs would have required GSS to price Pacnet’s additional power in the region of S$10,000 per kW (see above at [386]), did not address the non-cabling costs, and is therefore of limited assistance to me on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">413 As Mr Turvey eventually accepted during cross-examination, GSS was in no position to indicate how much capital expenditure it would have had to undertake if not for Arup’s Revised Design.

I am hence unable to conclude that there was a real and substantial chance of Pacnet accepting the same.

According to GSS, it could have delivered the initial 500 kW by April 2013 if Arup’s Revised Design had not utilised 1,400 kW of spare capacity in the Existing Facility’s SUPS system. Essentially, GSS contends that had there been sufficient spare capacity available in the Existing Facility’s SUPS system in June 2012, it could have agreed to Microsoft’s additional power requirements in June 2012 and immediately placed orders for the additional power and cooling equipment to meet its commitments.

Instead, it alleges that GSS was unable to do so because of: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the high capital expenditure that GSS had to incur to secure the 1,500 kW Microsoft Opportunity;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) GSS’s inability to meet the deadline for the latter two tranches due to the long lead time needed to order a fifth DRUPS unit; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) GSS’s inability to obtain additional cooling equipment in time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">425 In my judgment, GSS has not succeeded in showing that it would have had a chance of securing the 1,500 kW Microsoft Opportunity but for Arup’s breaches. This is because it has failed to show that it was Arup’s breaches which caused the expenditure for the proposal to become unsustainably high, which in turn caused GSS to pull the plug on this project. As mentioned above at [411]–[412], GSS only set about putting together a proposal for the 720 kW offer because it realised that the capital expenditure it would have had to incur for the 1,500 kW project was prohibitively high. As the party that bears the burden of proof, GSS has to show that this high capital expenditure was caused by Arup’s breaches. However, it has failed to adduce any evidence to show that this was the case. Indeed, GSS did not even seek to argue that this high capital expenditure was due to Arup’s breaches. It did not address this issue altogether in its closing submissions and reply submissions. Nor did Mr Turvey offer any evidence to show that it was Arup’s breaches which caused this project’s capital expenditure to become prohibitively high for GSS. I therefore find that GSS has failed to satisfy its burden of proof for loss of profits and/or loss of chance on this issue, and dismiss its claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">426 For completeness I deal with the other two points raised by Arup, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, GSS’s inability to obtain additional cooling equipment and a fifth DRUPS unit in time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">427 In relation to additional cooling, an email from Mr Franc Coles (“Mr Coles”) of AECOM suggests that GSS could potentially have met the deadlines for the additional cooling equipment.

</div> Thus, if an order for the equipment was placed by the end of October 2012, the chillers could have been delivered by March 2013, and the CRACs two months earlier; both well before the July 2013 deadline. However, I make no definitive finding on this as this is unnecessary given my findings above (at [415]). I also note that when taken to these emails in cross-examination, Mr Turvey stated as follows:

So what AECOM is basically telling Global Switch is that, “If we were to order for the cooling solution today, the earliest that we are going to look at for expected completion is going to be late April 2013 and at least in respect of the earlier requirement of Microsoft to have 500 kW by April 2013, there might be an issue because the cooling is only going to be finalised in late April 2013.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: That’s correct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">428 In relation to the fifth DRUPS unit, it is unclear whether GSS would have been able to place that order in time.

</div> While an order placed at the end of June 2012 might have allowed the DRUPS to be delivered by June 2013 at the latest, it is unclear if GSS could have placed such an order that quickly. I am unable to find, on balance, that GSS could have done so. Even before agreeing to Microsoft’s 1,500 kW requirements in June 2012, GSS’s practice indicates that it would have at least undertaken internal feasibility studies (considering that these are significant investments), and was also likely to have engaged third party consultants, such as AECOM, to advise it on its ability to meet Microsoft’s requirements. There is no clear indication of how long such studies and discussions would have taken. As the party which bears the burden of proof, GSS should have adduced evidence to show that it could have placed an order for the fifth DRUPS unit in time for it to be delivered by July 2013 even after undertaking the necessary preliminary enquiries. In my view, it has failed to discharge this burden as it has failed to adduce any evidence to this effect. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The 720 kW Microsoft Opportunity </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">429 GSS has also not succeeded in showing that it would have had a chance of securing a contract with Microsoft for 720 kW of additional power. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">430 GSS has not shown that Microsoft would have accepted the 720 kW proposal. As indicated above at [412], GSS presented the 720 kW offer to Microsoft on its own initiative as it was desperate to keep Microsoft as a tenant after it realised that the capital expenditure it needed to fulfil the 1,500 kW Microsoft Opportunity was too high. But the parameters of Microsoft’s search for additional power were always defined by Microsoft alone. Although its requirements evolved over time, the evidence does not show that Microsoft was willing to <span class="font-italic">negotiate</span> the amount of additional power it was going to get. GSS was not in any position to influence Microsoft’s requirements for additional power. In this light, GSS’s argument that negotiations between it and Microsoft tended to move very quickly such that it was “entirely possible for [GSS] and Microsoft to enter into a formal agreement on the spot if [GSS] had a technical solution that aligned with Microsoft’s specified requirements” takes it nowhere.

</div> The speed at which negotiations move has nothing to do with whether the Microsoft was willing to exercise any flexibility in the negotiations. Against this backdrop, GSS must show that its 720 kW offer would either have met Microsoft’s requirements, or would have caused Microsoft to compromise its own requirements at that time. It has failed to do either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">431 Even if it can be shown that Microsoft would have been open to accepting its 720 kW offer, GSS has not shown how Arup’s breaches caused it to lose this opportunity. By the time GSS had made its 720 kW offer to Microsoft, the latter’s requirements had increased to 2,500 kW, and nothing suggests that Microsoft would have been willing to accept anything lower. As Mr Turvey agreed during cross-examination, GSS’s ability to secure the 720 kW contract was “frustrated not by an act of Arup, but by the fact that Microsoft increas[ed] their [power] requirements … unexpectedly”.

</div> Indeed, GSS did not even address the issue of how Arup’s breaches caused it to lose the opportunity in its closing and reply submissions. I therefore find that GSS’s inability to secure the 720 kW opportunity was due to Microsoft increasing its requirements for additional power, rather than Arup’s beaches. For completeness, I also find that GSS has failed in its claim for lost profits arising from this claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">GSS’s heads of claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">432 In summary, I deal with each of GSS’s claims in the order presented in the agreed list of issues.

There was no NBP shortfall given my finding that parties had varied the original specification downwards to 2,800 kW in the first instance. The Revised Design was also necessitated by the Microsoft tenancy that GSS itself wanted to secure. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I dismiss<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>GSS’s claim for the additional cost of $2,972,994.19 in relation to the subsequent installation of the fourth DRUPS unit, as a separate project.

</div> But I have found there to be no such breach; Arup had recommended the bypass test and, whether in relation to Phase 1 or Phase 2 T&amp;C, any inadequacy in testing was attributable to instructions given or constraints imposed by GSS (such as the STSs not being available on the tight timeline, or Microsoft being a live customer). GSS’s claim under this head is also unmeritorious for other reasons. First, given its pleading that <span class="font-italic">further </span>T&amp;C had to be carried out to check for latent defects, it is surprising that GSS had not already done so by the time of trial. GSS would have been aware of such a need by 2014, after Mr Hamer conducted his various tests on the DRUPS and STSs.
