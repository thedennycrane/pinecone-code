The claimant then relied on two deeming provisions in s 125(2) of the IRDA (“s 125(2)”) to show that the defendant was unable to pay its debts.

</div> Nor did the defendant dispute that the statutory demand was validly served on it in accordance with the terms of s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Given the defendant’s position (which is well made out on the facts), then, subject to the court exercising its discretion not to wind up the defendant, the claimant was entitled to the winding up order sought. This is because the three grounds under s 125(2) for deeming a company to be unable to pay its debts are disjunctive; the claimant needs only to satisfy one of the grounds for a company to be deemed unable to pay its debts. As such, subject to the court’s overriding discretion not to order a winding up, this case could have been resolved on this simple ground alone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Second, and in the alternative, the claimant relied on s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA (“s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)”) and argued that the defendant should be deemed unable to pay its debts as it is cash flow insolvent.

However, Andre Maniam J in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Xia Zheng v Song Jianbo and another</span> [2022] SGHC 124 had set aside the writ of seizure and sale on the ground that the claimant could not seize and sell any of Mr Li’s interest since the Orchard Property had been dealt with in the divorce.

The fact remained that the claimant is not able to seize and sell the Orchard Property. It is therefore entirely the defendant’s speculation as to what might happen on the claimant’s appeal. Further, it is unclear how much the Orchard Property will fetch. While the defendant had put forth a possible figure at which the Orchard Property could be sold at, that was in fact the reserve price in the collective sale agreements circulated among the owners of the development.

The defendant said that the claim is meritorious because: (a) Aedit Abdullah J had granted Tanoto leave to defend the action on the condition that he furnishes security in the sum of S$1m, and (b) Audrey Lim J had allowed the defendant’s appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s decision ordering the defendant to furnish security of costs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 I disagreed with the defendant that its pending action in Suit 164 is relevant in the present application. In the first place, it is purely speculation on the defendant’s part that the trial will happen relatively quickly. The fact is that no trial dates have been fixed. Also, even if the defendant were to prevail, there is no indication that the defendant would be able to realise its claim within such time as to make it a relevant consideration in relation to its solvency. Moreover, it is pure speculation for the defendant to think that it is likely to win the case. Indeed, as the claimant pointed out, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric </span>did not consider an impending investment into the company there (evinced by a cashier’s order) as a valid reason not to wind up the company (at [34]). By that threshold, it is more so that the defendant’s pending claim in Suit 164, which has no certainty of success or timing, cannot be a relevant factor against winding up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The second matter the defendant said is relevant to its solvency is its legal action in Suit No 163 of 2012 (“Suit 163”). The defendant asserted that there is a judgment in the sum of S$17,488,000 against the eight counterparties there. Of this sum, S$9,032,000 is in favour of the defendant while the rest is in favour of Mr Li. Mr Li has assigned his portion of the judgment sum to the defendant, which has recovered S$581,417.49.

</div> Yet, the defendant has not managed to recover anything beyond what it had already recovered, even with the findings in the report. More substantively, the eight judgment debtors for the Suit 163 judgment are mostly bankrupted, defunct, in liquidation, or have limited assets within the jurisdiction. It is unlikely therefore that the defendant will make any further recovery in respect of Suit 163.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Accordingly, given that I did not consider either the action in Suit 164 or the judgment in Suit 163 to be relevant in assessing the defendant’s solvency, I concluded that the defendant is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), even if I were to consider the deeming provision under s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). This is because the defendant’s assertion of solvency was dependent on it being able “to reap from the fruits of S163 and S164”.

</div> If, as I had concluded, it was not relevant to consider the purported potential gains from Suit 163 and Suit 164 for ascertaining the defendant’s solvency, then there was also no need for me to further consider the extent of the defendant’s liabilities and whether that would be satisfied by these supposed gains. I should add that counsel for the defendant, Mr Naidu Devadas (“Mr Devadas”), agreed with me when I asked if the Solvent Argument was entirely dependent on me agreeing with his submissions on Suit 163 and Suit 164.

A creditor is entitled to choose any of the deeming provisions in s 125(2) to prove the company’s insolvency. This would have been sufficient to satisfy the ground for winding up under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), subject to the court exercising its discretion not to wind up the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The “Discretion Argument”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The defendant’s final argument was the “Discretion Argument”, which is that I should exercise my discretion <span class="font-italic">not </span>to wind up the defendant even if I were satisfied that a ground for winding up has been met. In this regard, it is not disputed that where a company is unable or deemed to be unable to pay its debts, the starting point is that a creditor is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to a winding-up order <span class="font-italic">ex debito justitiae</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric </span>at [85], citing the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BNP</span><span class="font-italic"> Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 at [15]). Nevertheless, the court has the overriding discretion to decline to make a winding up order when appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The main point that the defendant made was that a winding up order will disrupt its efforts to pursue or recover its claims under Suit 163 and Suit 164. In this regard, the defendant accepted that, if it is wound up, a liquidator can continue those efforts. However, the defendant argued that time and money would be lost for the liquidators to get up to speed. It would therefore be more expeditious for the defendant to continue to spearhead those efforts.

Furthermore, the fact remained that the liquidator will be empowered to continue the action in Suit 164 (see s 144(1) of the IRDA) and the recovery efforts for Suit 163.

</div> While I would have been open to hearing further arguments had there be a plausible argument I had not considered, the defendant’s potential further argument, with respect, was premised on a misunderstanding of my decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my oral reasons furnished to the parties (in writing) at the conclusion of the hearing on 5 August 2022, I had stated the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On this basis alone, subject to the court exercising its discretion not to wind up the defendant, the claimant is entitled to the winding up order sought. <span class="font-italic">This is because the three grounds under </span><span class="font-italic">s 125(2) for deeming a company to be unable to pay its debts are disjunctive</span>; the claimant needs only to satisfy one of the grounds for a company to be deemed unable to pay its debts. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">From the above, the point I made was that the three grounds under s 125(2) of the IRDA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ss 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), and 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), are disjunctive.

The defendant had relied on the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”) in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric</span>, which is substantively identical with s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA, to argue that the three limbs within s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) should be read conjunctively. The Court of Appeal had said this (at [92]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We begin by highlighting two issues with the drafting of this provision. First, it seems to us that the word ‘or’ appearing before ‘compound for it…’ may lead to some confusion. Its use may seem to indicate that the three limbs it qualifies are disjunctive such that the company will be deemed unable to pay its debts if it merely neglects to satisfy one of the three limbs. It is, however, plain to us that the intention was that the limbs be considered conjunctively so that the company will <span class="font-italic">not</span> be deemed to be unable to pay its debts as long as it has been able to satisfy one of the limbs. It is clear that this must be what is meant, as a disjunctive reading leads to an absurd result. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal’s reading of s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act (“s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)”). I also agree with a similar reading of s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA, in so far as it is substantively similar with s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). This means that I actually agree with the defendant that the three limbs <span class="font-italic">within </span>s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) are to be read conjunctively. But this does not assist the defendant’s case against winding up. This is because this was <span class="font-italic">not </span>the basis of my decision to order the winding up. Also, there is no dispute – and in fact, the defendant itself admits this – that the three <span class="font-italic">conjunctive </span>requirements as to the statutory demand within s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) have been met in the present case. Accordingly, I did not see a basis for hearing further arguments with respect to this point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court has a duty and obligation to delve further even when s 125(2)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) is satisfied</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The defendant’s second potential further argument was that, even if s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) has been satisfied, the court has a duty and obligation to investigate further to determine, based on the evidence tendered by the defendant, whether it should be deemed to be unable to pay its debts. In particular, the defendant said that if I was not convinced by the evidence adduced by the defendant, I should have directed that other evidence be placed before me so that I can better appreciate the defendant’s actual business and cash flow positions.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I had no hesitation in indicating that I did not wish to hear further argument on this point. First, I did not see the basis for the defendant’s submission that the court had such a duty and obligation to delve further. The whole point of a deeming provision is to establish a factual paradigm upon the satisfaction of certain factual parameters. It is then left to the party who wishes to rebut this factual paradigm to adduce evidence to do so, within what may be permissible within the relevant statutory regime. I did not see such a basis within the IRDA. There was no real reason to engage in a detailed inquiry into the defendant’s financial standing where the winding-up petition was based on an unsatisfied statutory demand. As Choo Han Teck J said in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">BW</span><span class="font-italic"> Umuroa Pte Ltd v Tamarind Resources Pte Ltd</span> [2020] 4 SLR 1294 at [25]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if the defendant is genuinely solvent as it claims, it should have satisfied the statutory demand. It is no defence to a valid statutory demand for the defendant to say that it is solvent, but that it refuses to pay, compound or secure the debt. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, and in any event, it is undisputed (and in fact accepted by the defendant) that the requirements under s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) have been met. I therefore do not see any basis to re-examine whether those requirements have been met.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The list of factors to be considered when applying the cash flow test is “non-exhaustive”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The defendant’s third potential further argument was that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric </span>had set out a non-exhaustive list of factors that should be considered under the cash flow test to ascertain if a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts under s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). The defendant seemed to be suggesting that I should consider other factors specific to the present case, such as the true merits of Suit 164 and its current assets.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Again, I had no hesitation in indicating that I did not wish to hear further argument on this point. First, it was not my place to conduct an extensive adjudication of the merits of Suit 164. All that I had before me was that Suit 164 is a pending action with no reasonable prospect of final resolution within the 12-month timeframe prescribed for the cash flow test (see <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric </span>at [65]). Second, given that I was not with the defendant on its supposed potential gains from Suit 163 and Suit 164, it followed that there was no need for me to examine its current assets. This is because, as I said earlier, the defendant’s argument of being cash flow solvent is contingent on it being able to reap its potential gains from Suit 163 and Suit 164 (see above at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In any event, it remained that I could have granted the order to wind up the defendant without the need to rely on s 125(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For all these reasons, I certified that I did not need to hear further arguments from the defendant. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lem Jit Min Andy, Toh Wei Yi and Ng Hua Meng Marcus (Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Naidu Devadas and Abirame S (Metropolitan Law Corporation) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nadine Victoria Neo Su Hui and Wu Siyue (Quahe Woo &amp; Palmer LLC) for the first non-party;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Poon Chun Wai (WongPartnership LLP) for the second non-party;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Benjamin Yim for the Official Receiver (Ministry of Law (IPTO)). </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
