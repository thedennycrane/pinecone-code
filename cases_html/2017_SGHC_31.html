</div> When the co-accused arrived at or about 3.55pm, the accused met him at the company’s parking area where the accused’s car was parked. The accused then told the co-accused to stand behind the car so that other workers would not be able to see him. Thereafter, the accused took the Packets out from his car and handed them over to the co-accused, who kept them in his black sling bag.

The Prosecution did not address me on sentence in respect of either accused persons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Based on the language of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the accused bears the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that he was a mere courier (<span class="font-italic">Chum Tat Suan</span> at [19]).

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chum Tat Suan </span>similarly noted that “the statutory relief afforded under s 33B does not apply to those whose involvement with drugs extends beyond that of transporting, sending or delivering the drugs” (at [66]). This is, however, subject to the fact-specific qualifier that “the mere incidental act of storage or safe-keeping by the accused person in the course of transporting, sending or delivering the drugs, should not take him outside of the definition of a courier”, although conduct that is not a necessary element of the transportation of the drugs, such as packing, would so disqualify the accused (<span class="font-italic">Chum Tat Suan</span> at [67]–[68]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Based on the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the accused had proven on a balance of probabilities that his role in the offence was restricted to that of transporting the diamorphine within the scope of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. Indeed, according to the agreed statement of facts, the task assigned to the accused by the said “Siva” was precisely to deliver drugs from Malaysia to Singapore.

</div> Those facts also showed that, on 5 December 2014, all that the accused did was to collect the drugs in Johor Bahru, and meet up with the co-accused in Singapore to pass the drugs on to the latter. The accused did keep the drug in his car for a few hours on that day, but I accept that that was merely “incidental” to the transportation and delivery of the drugs to the co-accused, and therefore within the qualifier identified in <span class="font-italic">Chum Tat Suan</span>. There was nothing to suggest that the accused had gone beyond the scope of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). I therefore found that the requirements in s 33B(2) of the MDA were satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Sentence Imposed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Satisfaction of the requirements in s 33B(2) of the MDA confers upon the court a discretion to impose, instead of death penalty, life imprisonment and caning of not less than 15 strokes under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) (<span class="font-italic">Chum Tat Suan</span> at [3]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the present case, in respect of the accused, there was nothing that called for either a sentence of death rather than life imprisonment, or the imposition of more than 15 strokes of the cane. The culpability or criminal responsibility of the accused was not higher than that of other couriers. The agreed statement of facts indicated that the accused had carried out similar acts for a period of a few weeks; he had also obtained some money as a reward for his activities, though the amount was not high. The level of culpability was thus not so substantial in respect of the trafficking as to outweigh both his limited role as a courier and the substantive assistance that was certified. While the harm caused by acts of trafficking is always significant – drug abuse remains a major social problem – it was in this case not so significant as to call for either the imposition of a sentence of death, or for more than the minimum number of strokes. The Prosecution did not submit otherwise. In the light of all these factors, I was of the view that a sentence of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane was sufficient, and I sentenced the accused accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The basis of the accused’s dissatisfaction with the sentence imposed is not clear. The sentence imposed was the minimum permitted under the law. If the accused seeks a shorter sentence, this is not allowed. The imprisonment regime does, however, provide for the review of sentences of life imprisonment at the 20-year mark under Division 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As for the co-accused, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, as required under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. This was on the basis of a similar finding that he acted only in the limited role of a courier, as well as an Institute of Mental Health psychiatric report dated 22 January 2015, which was tendered by the Defence and not contested by the Prosecution, stating that the co-accused had been suffering from depression at the material time which substantially impaired his mental responsibility in the commission of the offence.
