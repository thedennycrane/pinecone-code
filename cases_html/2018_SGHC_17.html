The sum of $180,000 is the balance of an interest-free loan of $300,000, while the other sum of $340,000 is a loan of $170,000 with interest of $170,000 payable over two years. The defendant does not deny having received the sums of $300,000 and $170,000 in 2010 and 2012 respectively.

According to the plaintiffs, the defendant initially wanted to borrow $400,000 for the Aspen Heights Property, which was to be an investment but would also serve as residence for the defendant and DW2 during the interim period. When asked why he did not borrow the sum from his father, the defendant told PW1 that he was not on good terms with his father, who was a businessman in Hong Kong. PW1 then discussed the matter with PW2. They could only raise $300,000, which they later transferred to the defendant. The loan was to be repaid in full in two or three years’ time and the Aspen Heights Property was to be registered in the joint names of the defendant and DW2.

When he discussed the idea with DW2, she objected and proposed instead that he purchase the property jointly with her. The defendant acceded to DW2’s proposal. DW2 then called the plaintiffs over the phone sometime in December 2011 and requested their assistance. In late December 2011, the plaintiffs told the defendant and DW2 over the phone that they would give them the sum of $170,000, which was later transferred to the defendant on 24 May 2012.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The sole issue in this case was whether the two transactions of $300,000 and $170,000 were loans or gifts to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It is not disputed that there were no written documents for these transactions. The parties’ evidence and positions were poles apart as regards the purpose of these transactions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Despite the discrepancies in the plaintiffs’ evidence, I accept the plaintiffs’ version of events and find that their claim is made out on a balance of probabilities. This is largely based on the objective evidence that is contemporaneous with the transfer of both the $300,000 and $170,000 for which the defendant was unable to provide satisfactory answers. I shall explain my findings in relation to each of the Loan Agreements in turn. But first, given the nature of the evidence, I shall identify the challenges in this case and explain how I dealt with them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sieving the truth from untruths and half-truths</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Before I address my findings in this case, I shall briefly set out the approach that I have taken.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Treating the parties’ evidence with caution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The outcome of this case depends solely on the parties’ testimonies and the reliability of the evidence. I must treat the evidence of the plaintiffs with great care and caution as it is clear that the plaintiffs and the defendant are no longer on good terms. This is because the defendant had instituted the Divorce Proceedings against DW2 to end their marriage of about six years. This is very unfortunate and I am deeply saddened that their marriage was very short as marriage is a lifelong commitment. This suit, Suit 1201, was launched by the plaintiffs after the defendant commenced the Divorce Proceedings. The relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant has therefore turned sour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It was also evident in the plaintiffs’ testimonies in court that they were very protective of their daughter, DW2, whom they doted on dearly. This was obvious when the defendant’s counsel cross-examined them on paras 18(a) and (b) of DW2’s affidavit of assets and means that she made in the Divorce Proceedings. DW2’s position in her affidavit of assets and means regarding the purpose of the two sums of $300,000 and $170,000 was completely different from the plaintiffs’ position and indeed, it is irreconcilable with the plaintiffs’ claim. At para 18(a) of her affidavit, she said that these monies were her contributions towards the purchase of the Aspen Heights Property and the Canne Lodge Property, and that the monies were remitted by her parents, the plaintiffs, into the defendant’s bank account. However, the plaintiffs claim that these were loans to the defendant. I shall later elaborate these issues further in my judgment. At this point, given the nature of the relationships between the various parties in this case and the importance of their oral testimonies, it is critical that I must exercise prudence and great care when I assess the testimonies of the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I must also exercise great care in evaluating the defendant’s evidence. He is also now not on good terms with the plaintiffs and DW2. The Divorce Proceedings on ancillary matters relating to the distribution of matrimonial assets have yet to be finalised. I understand that the outcome of this case will have a significant bearing on their distribution of their matrimonial assets. There are also deep emotions on the part of the defendant. The defendant, in his application to call DW2 as his witness, submitted at para 20 that “his relationship with her [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, DW2] was acrimonious as a result of the matrimonial proceedings”. In these circumstances, it is equally important that great care and caution must also be exercised in considering the defendant’s testimony, as the defendant is also determined to deny the plaintiffs’ claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Initially, the defendant vacillated as to whether to call DW2 as his witness. Eventually, the defendant decided to call her as his witness. On the witness stand, it was clear that DW2 was not cooperative and was hostile towards the defendant. Her unfavourable testimony led the defendant’s counsel to treat her as a hostile witness and she was subjected to cross-examination with the permission of the court. I found her testimony inscrutable and her answers were often <span class="font-italic">non sequitur</span>. I shall deal with these issues in greater details below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 To sieve the truth from untruths and half-truths, I searched for corroborative and objective evidence as well as logically convincing facts to ascertain whether I should accept the plaintiffs’ or the defendant’s version of events. As their versions regarding the purpose of $300,000 and $170,000 are diametrically opposite, both the versions cannot be the truth.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Dealing with discrepancies in the witnesses’ testimonies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In this case both parties relied heavily on the oral testimonies of their witnesses. I observed that there were discrepancies in the testimonies of both parties’ witnesses. In any trial there will often be discrepancies. Discrepancies in the evidence can occur within the same witness or between the witnesses when their testimonies are scrutinised and compared with the testimonies of other witnesses or the evidence. This is largely because different people observe and remember things differently. Thus their recollection of events and evidence will often vary from person to person. The duty of the court is to evaluate the seriousness and reliability of the discrepancies in order to ascertain the truth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">34 </span>The issue of discrepancies in the testimonies of witnesses is often raised in criminal trials. This issue is also germane to the present case as the outcome of this case also depends on the weight to be given to the witnesses’ oral testimonies. Therefore, the approaches taken by the judges in dealing with discrepancies of witnesses’ testimonies in the context of criminal trials will be useful in this case. I shall now refer to a few criminal cases that explained the reasons for discrepancies in the testimonies of the witnesses and what the court should do when dealing with discrepancies.

Sometimes what may appear to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies. Absolute truth is I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common experience. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognized by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate need do is to consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies. If, after considering the discrepancies, if a magistrate finds that the discrepancies do not detract from the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would then be proper for him to regard the discrepancies as trivial and ignore them. On the other hand, if the magistrate finds that the discrepancies relate to a material point which would seriously affect the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses then it would be his duty to weigh the evidence carefully in arriving at the truth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">35 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In relation to the effect of discrepancies, the remarks of Thomson CJ in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Khoon</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Chye Hin v Public Prosecutor </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[1961] </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">27 MLJ 105 at 107 on discrepancies are also often quoted:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points then it is clear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the rest of his evidence must be scrutinized with great care and indeed with suspicion.

The money had not yet been disbursed at that juncture. It was in the defendant’s best interests to accurately portray the sum of money. Indeed, it was the defendant who described the $300,000 as a loan to him on his own accord without any prompting or questioning from Joanne. As a practising lawyer by that time, he would have known the legal difference between a gift and a loan and would not say that the money was a loan if it were in fact only a gift. He would have known that if the $300,000 was a loan, there would be legal obligations of repayment. In contrast, if it was a gift, then there would be no legal obligation to repay the $300,000 as it would be a gratuitous gesture from the plaintiffs. Despite the fact that he must have known the difference, the defendant chose to describe the $300,000 as a “loan” in the email. At that stage the relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant was positive and this piece of evidence was also untarnished by any negative emotions.

</div> The defendant testified that he intended to repay the gift when he had the financial means to do so. That was why he chose to call it a loan. In other words, the defendant would have had the option of deciding whether or not to repay depending on his financial situation. If this was indeed the case, the defendant would not have said to Joanne that it was a “loan amount from Dad”. It is in the very nature of a gift that there is no need to repay it whether or not the defendant has the financial means to do so. Furthermore, his subsequent repayments of fixed sums on two different occasions suggest instead that they were fixed repayments (a point that I shall come to subsequently).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I also cannot accept the explanation that the defendant gave in his oral testimony. It is unconvincing that the defendant had used the word “loan” in his email merely to avoid sowing discord with Joanne, as he could have simply provided the details of his joint bank account with DW2 without mentioning that it was for either a gift or for a loan. Moreover, his subsequent explanation during his oral testimony undermines his initial explanation in his AEIC (which was also repeated on the stand), as the two reasons are materially different and do not complement one another. Hence, I do not accept both of the defendant’s explanations for the email and indeed I find that the differing explanations that he gave diminishes his credibility as a witness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The defendant’s repayments of two sums of $60,000</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The second piece of corroborative and objective evidence is the defendant’s repayment of $60,000 on two occasions (totalling $120,000) on 5 July 2011 and 29 June 2012 which seems to be done annually over two years. The parties do not dispute that these repayments took place. <span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span>, the repayments suggest that the $300,000 was a loan.

</div> This is a bare assertion and the defendant did not adduce any evidence or call any witness to support this assertion. In fact, the defendant’s own case in relation to the Second Loan Agreement contradicts this explanation. The second repayment was in June 2012. On 3 February 2012, which was before the second repayment, the defendant was in need of funds (of at least $170,000) as he wanted to purchase Canne Lodge Property for his investment. If the $300,000 was a gift and there was no legal obligation to repay the plaintiffs the said sum, it beggars belief that he would have made the second repayment out of appreciation since he would have been short on funds at that time. Instead, the defendant’s own case is that he needed the money to purchase the Canne Lodge Property, which was why he approached the plaintiffs for $170,000 (which he also asserts is a gift). He would not have made that second repayment but would have used the $60,000 towards the payment for the Canne Lodge Property instead. Accordingly, I am unable to give weight to this assertion.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendant also said in his AEIC that PW2 had queried him on “one of these occasions [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one of the transfers]” as to: “Why on earth are you transferring his money to me?”

</div> I find this testimony to be illogical. If it were true that PW2 was not expecting repayment at all, one would expect her to have objected or to have queried the defendant on the very first occasion that the money was transferred. While PW2 could certainly also have questioned the defendant <span class="font-italic">again</span> when the second sum was transferred, what is conspicuous is the defendant’s evidence that she did not do so the first time. I find the plaintiffs’ testimonies more convincing when they said that they had been chasing the defendant for the repayment of the $300,000 as this was their hard-earned money.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I accept that at the time of the discussion relating to the loan of $300,000, the plaintiffs would not have thought to record the precise date of the discussion given that the plaintiffs and the defendant at that time were in a good relationship. In January 2010, the defendant had just married DW2 for barely three months. Thus the idea of the defendant not honouring the loan would have been furthest away from the plaintiffs’ mind. Naturally, the loan transaction was done informally and orally without the legal formalities that one would expect if the loan agreement were between business associates. Moreover, this discussion had happened a few years before the plaintiffs sued the defendant in 2016. Thus it is understandable that the plaintiffs would not have been able to recall the precise date. Given that the date of the defendant’s passport entries corroborated with the demise of PW1’s mother and that the defendant had attended her funeral in Malaysia (as evidenced by her obituary, which is objective evidence), I find that the amendment does not undermine the plaintiffs’ case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Furthermore, the defendant did not deny that he had spoken to the plaintiffs, particularly PW1, prior to the remittance of the $300,000 into his joint bank account with DW2. It is the purpose of these transactions that is hotly contested. Given the nature of the defendant’s defence and the undisputed facts, this further supports my view that the plaintiffs’ amendment does not undermine their case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Material contradictions in the plaintiffs’ oral testimonies</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The defendant also submits that the plaintiffs’ oral testimonies contained material contradictions that could not be resolved.

</div> The defendant’s point was presumably that these accounts contradicted one another.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I do not think that there is a contradiction between both accounts. PW1 and PW3 had testified that only the two of them were present and that PW2 was not present. Obviously, this meant that PW2 could not have given evidence that she was present when the conversation at the plaintiffs’ garden (in their house) took place. But this does not mean that her testimony that the defendant had asked for the $400,000 initially over the phone was inaccurate. Instead, in all likelihood, the defendant had spoken first to PW1 and PW2 over the phone and then when he had gone to the plaintiffs’ house, he spoke with PW1 in person and PW3 was also present at this meeting. Indeed, this is consistent with the defendant’s own testimony, where he confirms that he (together with DW2) had spoken to the plaintiffs over the phone regarding the purchase of the Aspen Heights Property, and that the plaintiffs had agreed to transfer to him the sum over the phone.

After that he referred to another occasion when he was having tea that the defendant approached him. While PW1 did say that this other occasion happened on a different day, it was unclear whether he was still referring to the conversation where the plaintiffs informed the defendant that they would only be able to provide $300,000. The defendant’s counsel chose not to follow up on this point but instead chose to move to another point.

</div> The plain reading of those relevant portions of her affidavit clearly contradicted her testimony in court. Because of DW2’s incomprehensible and illogical explanation of her affidavit on the stand, I conclude that she is highly unreliable as a witness. I therefore find it unsafe to rely on her evidence. Her testimony was obviously tainted with bias in favour of the plaintiffs. She took two irreconcilable and untenable positions at the same time. First, that the $300,000 and $170,000 were loans given to the defendant for the purchase of the Aspen Heights and Canne Lodge Properties. Second, that those sums were her direct contributions towards the purchase of these properties. In my view it is best to totally disregard her evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">PW3’s evidence supports the plaintiffs’ claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Finally, the plaintiffs’ position was also supported by the testimony of PW3, whose evidence was not weakened by the cross-examination of the defendant’s counsel.

This email, like the previous email pertaining to the First Loan Agreement, is a very important piece of evidence as it was contemporaneous and was crafted by the defendant without being prompted. At that time, the parties would not have expected that the email would be used in these proceedings. It can therefore be relied upon as a candid reflection of what the defendant would have thought to be the nature of the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In this email, the defendant was silent as to whether he thought of the $170,000 as a gift or as a loan. This silence is significant in light of the fact that the money would be used for an investment. If the $170,000 were a gift, the defendant would not have had any obligation to repay it, essentially giving him a free $170,000 in capital and the profits that come with it from the investment. In contrast, if the money had been a loan, he would not only have had to repay the principal sum but also any interest. The difference between the two situations is so stark that if the money was a gift, the defendant would likely have wanted to confirm that it was in his email to Joanna as he was a practising lawyer and was fully aware of the legal implications between a gift and a loan. I have previously come to the conclusion that the earlier $300,000 was a loan and the defendant had also called it a loan in his email to Joanne. Therefore, if the $170,000 was indeed a gift from the plaintiffs the defendant would have certainly mentioned it in his email to Joanne. The gift would have assisted the defendant financially since in 2012 he was already heavily indebted as a result of his purchase of the Aspen Heights Property.  All things considered, the defendant would have mentioned in his email to Joanne that the plaintiffs would be remitting the $170,000 to him as a gift for the investment to confirm that he was not legally obliged to repay the plaintiffs. However, he did not do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The circumstances in which the $170,000 was transferred to the defendant</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The plaintiffs’ claim that the $170,000 was a loan is also supported by the circumstances in which the $170,000 was transferred. PW1’s evidence was that in May 2012 his own account was in the red and he did not have any money to lend the defendant, unlike the situation in 2010 when he lent the defendant the $300,000 for the Aspen Heights Property. Nevertheless, PW1 could still loan the $170,000 from his “overdraft monies”.

If the Canne Lodge Property was the matrimonial home of the defendant and DW2, it might have been possible that the plaintiffs would offer them an interest-free loan to help them to set up their home despite having to draw on PW1’s overdraft facilities. But the purpose of the $170,000 was for an investment – the defendant and DW2 already had a matrimonial home in the Aspen Heights Property. It would only make sense to the plaintiffs if the defendant offered attractive returns better than the charges incurred from the bank for the use of the overdraft facilities. Indeed, as I shall later explain, the evidence shows that the defendant offered to double the principal sum in two years. This was good enough reason for the plaintiffs to lend him the sum of $170,000.

Either way, it does not change the outcome as the analysis I have just explained pertains to the implausibility of PW1 incurring debts on his own behalf which would only benefit the defendant with no benefit to PW1 whatsoever.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant’s objections to the plaintiffs’ version of events</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Having considered the objective evidence and the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the $170,000, I turn now to address the defendant’s objections to the plaintiffs’ version of events.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was implausible that the defendant would have agreed to an “astronomical” interest of $170,000.

However, the context is important in determining whether the interest rate is so prohibitively high that it makes it highly unlikely that the defendant would have sought a loan from the plaintiffs. By 2012, the defendant had already taken a huge bank loan for the Aspen Heights Property – which had cost some $1.65m – and it is highly unlikely that he had the financial gearing to be able to obtain another large bank loan for another property purely for investment purposes. Despite being heavily in debt, the defendant was eager to venture into property investment as he was of the view that the property prices in 2012 were relatively low and that he could gain from a potential uptrend in the market.

</div> But he later abandoned this idea when DW2 proposed that she be included in the investment instead through asking the plaintiffs for money. Before the defendant exercised his Option to Purchase the Canne Lodge Property on 3 February 2012, he was convinced that he could obtain the desired amount that he needed from the plaintiffs. The consistent evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3 is that the defendant was confident of getting good returns of more than $170,000 within two years (which would come from not only the increased value of the Property, but also from the income from renting it out). He had said to the plaintiffs that he expected to make a profit from buying and subsequently selling the Property. He asked the plaintiffs how much they expected to earn from the $170,000

</div> Seen in this light, the interest payable to the plaintiffs for the loan of $170,000 at 50% per annum is realistic as he had to entice the plaintiffs to part with their money despite already being in the red.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Implausible that the plaintiffs would extend a second loan when the defendant had not fully repaid the $300,000</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Second, the defendant also submits that the plaintiffs would not have lent him a second sum as he had not repaid the first sum in full at this point. But by this time, the defendant had already paid the first repayment of $60,000 in July 2011. There was no reason for the plaintiffs to believe that he would not continue to make such payments in relation to the First Loan Agreement as the defendant was a lawyer and DW2 was a medical doctor, both with well-paying jobs. There was also no apparent acrimony between the defendant and DW2 at this time that would cause the plaintiffs – her parents – to suspect that an additional loan would not be paid back, especially if it were to be used for an investment that would supposedly yield great returns.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) DW2’s affidavit of assets and means contradicted the plaintiffs’ case</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Third, the defendant further submits that the plaintiffs’ claim was contradicted by DW2’s affidavit of assets and means in the Divorce Proceedings.

The plaintiffs’ original statement of claim stated that the Second Loan Agreement was entered into on 10 May 2012, but this was later amended to read “22 to 24 January 2012”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Similar to the First Loan Agreement, I find that the plaintiffs’ amendment does not assist the defendant’s case. It was not disputed that the defendant intended to purchase the Canne Lodge Property for investment. The defendant felt that the property market at that time was bullish and that property was a good investment with high returns. It was also not disputed that he told PW1 of this investment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Given this backdrop, the timeline of events leading up to the transfer becomes significant. The defendant was granted the Option to Purchase for the Canne Lodge Property on 7 January 2012. He eventually exercised the Option on 3 February 2012. Regardless of whether he had received the $170,000 from PW1 as a loan or a gift, it is likely that the defendant had come to an agreement with PW1 on the matter in between these two dates. It would otherwise have been unlikely for the defendant to have exercised the Option without first being assured that he had the funds to complete the purchase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The plaintiffs’ version of events in the amended statement of claim – that the Second Loan Agreement was entered into between 22 and 24 January 2012 – corroborates this timeline. It was not disputed that the defendant visited the plaintiffs in Malaysia during the Chinese New Year period from 22 to 24 January 2012. This was when the defendant had received the Option to Purchase but had not yet exercised it. Therefore, it is likely that the defendant had asked PW1 for the loan of $170,000 during this visit. Hence, the plaintiffs’ amendment is consistent with the defendant having received an assurance from the plaintiffs between the dates that he received the Option and when he exercised it. I find that the amendment does not undermine the plaintiffs’ case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In relation to the amendment, the defendant also submits that since his email to Joanne (containing his personal bank account details) was only sent on 17 May 2012, it would not make sense for the email to be sent five months after the discussion, if the discussion indeed took place in January 2012.

And these are hard-earned monies. These are hard-earned monies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 From this exchange it is clear that what PW2 had meant was that the Second Loan Agreement had been reached in January 2012, although the plaintiffs only eventually transferred the sum of $170,000 in May 2012 after the Canne Lodge Property was viewed and after the defendant pressed them to do so. I do not think that there is a contradiction between the two. The plaintiffs appear to have used “agree to loan” in two different senses and this was not clarified by the defendant’s counsel in cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I would set out PW3’s testimony, which the defendant also submits is contradictory. The defendant’s counsel had cross-examined PW3 on what exactly PW1 had said during the meeting in January 2012 but PW3 could not recall precisely what he said:

But more importantly, PW3’s account does not materially contradict the account presented by PW1’s and PW2’s oral testimonies as I have set out above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 On the second point of whether the loan required 100% interest, the defendant relied on a passage in which PW3 had stated that he did not know whether the defendant expressly agreed to repay $340,000 to the plaintiffs.

</div> Presumably, the defendant’s point is that because PW3 was unsure, hence PW1’s evidence stands uncorroborated. However, that answer from PW3 must be seen in its entire context:

Neither PW1 nor PW2 was cross-examined on this point. In the circumstances, I do not think that the defendant has shown enough to diminish the overall evidence of the plaintiffs (and their witnesses) that there was a loan for $170,000 and with an additional $170,000 repayable as interest in two years’ time.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Second Loan Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Accordingly, I find that the $170,000 was transferred on the basis of the Second Loan Agreement between the parties.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s submissions, para 39.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> For this proposition the defendant referred to <span class="font-italic">Ang Teng Siong v Lee Su Min </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 908<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Ang Teng Siong</span>”), <span class="font-italic">ANZ v AOA</span> [2014] SGHC 243, and <span class="font-italic">TSI v TSJ</span> [2016] SGFC 91. These are matrimonial cases and in each of these cases, one of the spouses in the distribution of the matrimonial assets proceedings alleged that the parents gave the property solely to their child and not to both spouses. The court in those cases held that in the absence of clear and credible evidence to the contrary, a parent’s contribution towards the purchase of the child’s matrimonial home is presumed to be for the benefit of both spouses (see <span class="font-italic">Ang Teng Siong</span> at [28]; <span class="font-italic">ANZ v AOA </span>at [14];<span class="font-italic"> TSI v TSJ</span> at [34]). I would note that since this presumption applies only to matrimonial assets and not investment properties, at its highest it would only apply to the Aspen Heights Property and not the Canne Lodge Property, and indeed the defendant’s counsel accepted as much during his oral submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 This common law presumption does not assist the defendant’s case in relation to the Aspen Heights Property for two reasons. First, the central issue in this case is not about whether the plaintiffs gave the monies to DW2 solely or to the defendant and DW2 jointly for the purchase of the Aspen Heights Property as their matrimonial home. Rather, the pivotal issue in this case pertains to whether the sums in question were loans or gifts. Hence, the presumption does not apply. Second, for the reasons I have given above, I have found that the $300,000 was a loan. Therefore, the presumption is not relevant in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 My findings are summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiffs transferred $300,000 interest-free to the defendant as a loan for the Aspen Heights Property which was to be the matrimonial home of the defendant and DW2. Since the defendant has only paid back $120,000 of that sum (in two tranches of $60,000 each), the defendant is now liable for the remaining sum of $180,000.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiffs further transferred $170,000 to the defendant as a loan for the Canne Lodge Property, which was an investment. The fact that PW1 had to draw on a bank overdraft and that the initial $300,000 was transferred as a loan made it implausible that this sum of $170,000 was a gift. The defendant is liable to the plaintiffs for this sum together with the interest of $170,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I shall now hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lazarus Nicholas Philip and Toh Yee Lin Jocelyn (Justicius Law Corporation) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Thio Shen Yi, SC and Nanthini d/o Vijayakumar (TSMP Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
