I keep these in mind when dividing the matrimonial assets.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> (2007)”) (at [31]–[33]), the Court of Appeal discussed two distinct methodologies that have been applied in the case law in the division of matrimonial assets – the global assessment methodology and the classification methodology. The global assessment methodology “consists of four distinct phases: <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, identification, assessment, division and apportionment” (at [31]). The classification methodology involves “an assimilation of all four of the above steps into a broad judicial discretion which, in the first instance, separately considers and divides<span class="font-italic"> classes</span> of matrimonial assets” [emphasis in original] (at [32]). The Court of Appeal explained that while there is “much to be said for either method, both of which are consistent with the legislative framework provided by s 112 of the [Women’s Charter]”, in the final analysis, the court should apply the methodology that achieves the paramount aim of ensuring that the matrimonial assets are divided in a just and equitable manner (at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In the present case, I will adopt the classification methodology.

This is because the IJ “puts an end to the marriage contract and indicates that the parties no longer intend to participate in the joint accumulation of matrimonial assets …”: <span class="font-italic">AJR v AJS</span> [2010] 4 SLR 617 at [4], cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span> at [32].

In other words, any asset or liability acquired or incurred after that date should not be included for division. He highlights that “relations between parties were virtually non-existent from [the date of separation].” Further, he submits that the parties had a “common understanding that they would cease to jointly acquire or invest in further assets, and that any future accumulation of assets would accrue to them individually”. He also emphasises that “parties always kept their finances separate in the course of their marriage, and largely paid for their own individual expenses”.

The mere fact that the parties made financial arrangements after the date of separation does not show that the marriage had not broken down by then. Those discussions strike me as purely transactional. I also do not see how the quantum of the Husband’s income is relevant to the analysis. It may be relevant if the Husband had suddenly made a windfall after the date of separation, but this is not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On the other hand, I agree with the Husband that the assets should be identified at the date of separation. While the IJ date is typically the date which “puts an end to the marriage contract” (see [9] above), I find that the marriage had come to an end by the date of separation. Indeed, as stated above, the Wife moved to China shortly after separating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 I find support for my conclusion in the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BRL v BRM</span> (Civil Appeal No 77 of 2018). In that case, because of an incident which transpired in February 2014, the wife moved to China on 1 March 2014 with their daughter, leaving the husband behind. Sometime in April 2014, the wife informed the husband that she and their daughter would not be returning to Singapore. In the circumstances, the High Court declined to include in the pool of assets the increase in value of a company owned by the husband after 2014. The High Court reasoned that this was because the wife “had, in effect, ended their marital relationship” when she left for China.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The present case is on all fours with <span class="font-italic">BRL v BRM</span> as the Wife here had also left for China after the Husband moved out of the matrimonial home. In fact, it is possible to argue that the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">BRL v BRM</span> applies <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> here because the parties in <span class="font-italic">BRL v BRM</span>, while separated, were still bound to co-operate in caring and providing for their daughter: s 46 of the Women’s Charter. In this case, the parties did not have a child and thus led their own lives after the date of separation, especially so after the Wife returned to China. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I also find support from the decision of the High Court (Family Division) in <span class="font-italic">UBD v UBE</span> [2017] SGHCF 14, where the court departed from the general rule that matrimonial assets should be valued at the date of the AM hearing date on the basis that the parties had lived separate and independent lives for six years before the divorce (at [12]). Thus, I will identify the matrimonial assets as at the date of separation in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 To be consistent, I will adopt the same approach in relation to identifying liabilities: see <span class="font-italic">UAP v UAQ</span> [2018] 3 SLR 319, where the High Court declined to take into account various alleged liabilities because they were not supported by evidence and were also incurred after the IJ date: see [67]. Since I have taken the date of separation as the point of reference when identifying assets, I will do the same for liabilities. As with assets, I will value liabilities at the AM hearing date where they have been incurred before the date of separation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Before I leave this point, I clarify that I am not laying down a general rule or even a presumption that matrimonial assets should be determined or valued at the date of separation. Indeed, the Court of Appeal has held otherwise because the law “regards the parties as being in a subsisting legal union even though that union may have undergone factual disintegration”: <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span> at [40]. Nevertheless, there are cogent reasons for adopting the date of separation as the operative date for determining the assets in this case: the parties did not have children and the Wife returned to China shortly after the parties separated, where she lived and engaged in business ventures for several years before coming back to Singapore to participate in these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I now turn to the parties’ various assets and liabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">River Valley property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The River Valley property is the matrimonial home which the parties purchased in July 2010 for $1,350,000.

</div> I disagree. The term loan is an encumbrance on the River Valley property. It is a sum that must be repaid if and when the parties attempt to realise the value of the River Valley property by selling it. In this way, the value of the River Valley property is compromised by the existence of the term loan. The manner in which the term loan is used does not change this fact. In the circumstances, the net value of this property is the difference between its gross value and the sum of the two loans: $561,149.17. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Marina property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Marina property is an investment property which the parties purchased in February 2013 for about $5,800,000.

This approach was succinctly summarised in <span class="font-italic">TIT v TIU</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1137 (“<span class="font-italic">TIT v TIU</span>”) at [21] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets [(“Step 1”)];</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions [(“Step 2”)]; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter … [(“Step 3”)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The present case is unique because the marriage broke down and the Wife left Singapore a few years before the IJ date. The issue is whether, when applying the structured approach, the parties’ contributions (both direct and indirect) should be assessed up till the date of separation, the IJ date or the AM hearing date. In this regard, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span> [2016] 4 SLR 674 (“<span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span>”) is apposite. In that case, the parties entered into a deed of separation which covered the division of matrimonial assets in the event of a divorce. The wife subsequently filed for divorce. In deciding the AM, the High Court held that the deed did not reflect a fair and equitable distribution of assets and should be varied because the sum of $40,000 awarded to the wife only reflected the parties’ relative contributions up till the date of the deed and did not adequately take into account the wife’s continuing indirect contributions to the marriage until its final dissolution: <span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span> at [23]. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It applied <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span> by analogy, holding that (at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The question is whether the marriage still exists in any meaningful sense such that the actions of the parties, whether in the <span class="font-italic">acquisition of assets</span>, the <span class="font-italic">care of their children</span>, or otherwise, may properly be said to have been done during the subsistence of the marriage and should therefore be taken into account in the division exercise. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Court of Appeal concluded that since the parties’ marital relationship came to a close with the conclusion of the deed, there was no injustice in the fact that the deed did not appear to take the wife’s continuing role as primary caregiver to the child into account when determining her share of the matrimonial assets: <span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span> at [27]. I add that while the specific issue in that case was whether the wife’s indirect contributions after the conclusion of the deed should be taken into consideration, it is clear from the Court of Appeal’s comments at [25] of <span class="font-italic">AUA v ATZ</span> (extracted immediately above at [42]) that the same principles apply to direct financial contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Returning to the facts of the present case, I have, applying <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX</span>, found that the parties’ marriage did not exist in any meaningful sense after the date of separation: [13] above.

Thus, there was no need for either or both of them to take the role of a caregiver. The traditional division of labour between the breadwinner and the homemaker does not apply here at all. Instead, both parties were very much focused on their careers. I accept that the Husband probably contributed more towards the payment of bills and other outgoing given his higher income, that he did household chores from October 2003 to August 2004 when he was searching for employment and that he cared for the Wife and her family to the best of his ability. On the other hand, I also accept that the Wife supported the Husband when he first moved to Singapore, that she took care of the expenses when the Husband was unemployed and that she cared for the Husband as well.

</div> I accept that these expenditures are rather high, even for a person who earns more than $20,000 a month. I also accept that the sum remitted to the Husband’s sister is suspicious, given that the transfer was made in March 2013, when the Husband moved out of the matrimonial home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Nevertheless, in the exercise of my discretion, I will not draw an adverse inference against the Husband. This is because the Husband’s earnings after the date of separation do not form matrimonial assets: see [26] and [32] above. I note that the Husband earns almost $300,000 a year. Thus, even if the Court were to find that the Husband had dissipated $836,726 since March 2013, that sum could be taken as having been earned after March 2013, and therefore would form no part of the matrimonial assets to be divided. The same applies to the Wife. Given that she had left for China to carry out business more than half a decade ago, it is inconceivable that she did not earn any income or had no bank account in China. Nevertheless, I decline to draw an adverse inference against her because assets amassed during her time in China after March 2013 form no part of the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal fees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Wife has also requested for the parties’ legal costs in these proceedings to be “clawed back” into the pool of assets.

It would be an unwise precedent to allow parties to deduct their hefty legal costs from the pool of matrimonial assets.
