It arose from the decision of a Judge of the General Division of the High Court (the “Judge”) in <span class="font-italic">Lyu</span><span class="font-italic"> Jun v Wei Ho-Hung</span> [2021] SGHC 268 (the “Judgment”). On 22 July 2022, we heard the appeal. After hearing submissions from parties, we substantially dismissed the appeal, though we varied an aspect of the Judge’s decision. At [59]–[63] below, we will explain the basis on which we decided to effect this variation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The background to this matter is stated more fully in the Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In essence, the parties met in March 2016, and, by May 2016, they became romantically involved. It bears highlighting that the respondent (“Mr Lyu”) was married at the time he and the appellant (“Ms Wei”) entered into their relationship. Mr Lyu remained married throughout, though his wife was in the process of obtaining a divorce from him. He wished to marry Ms Wei after his divorce and to formally start their life together as a married couple. In this connection, he had informed Ms Wei that upon his divorce, some of his assets would need to be transferred to his wife (see the Judgment at [44] and [49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 During their relationship, Mr Lyu transferred substantial sums of money to Ms Wei. These sums were used to acquire assets in Ms Wei’s name, such as an apartment, as well as for various other purposes which did not result in the ownership of an unencumbered asset, such as to discharge a mortgage over Ms Wei’s apartment. After their relationship soured and ended, Mr Lyu sought to recover these assets and sums of money, the collective value of which he claimed was around S$8 million, though Ms Wei only admitted to receiving around S$7 million (see the Judgment at [7]). This disagreement is not salient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 There were <span class="font-italic">ten</span> assets and sums of money in respect of which Mr Lyu brought claims. Adopting the descriptions used by the Judge (see the Judgment at [8]), the assets and claims concerned the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The D’Leedon apartment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Car;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The discharge of the Bartley mortgage;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Cairnhill option;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The first clinic investment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The US surrogacy;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The application for Grenadian citizenship;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) The Marne Road shop;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The second clinic investment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) The Rolex watch.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At trial, Mr Lyu’s overarching contention was that the transfers made to Ms Wei were not gifts, and had only been made with a view to building their life together as a married couple. Ms Wei was thus not entitled to retain them once their relationship came to an end. In response, Ms Wei’s general defence was that she received them as gifts of love, and was therefore entitled to them <span class="font-italic">wholly</span>. We note that it was not Ms Wei’s case that she was entitled to a share of the assets and sums of money. For her, it was <span class="font-italic">all-or-nothing</span>, and this is what the Judge understood her case to be as well (see the Judgment at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Judge found substantially for Mr Lyu and allowed eight of his ten claims. Only the two claims relating to the money used to discharge the Bartley mortgage and the Rolex watch were dismissed (see the Judgment at [62]–[67] and [91]–[93] respectively).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In arriving at his decision, the Judge took into account the parties’ oral evidence on the stand, text messages, and various pieces of evidence which shed light on the context of their communications. In general, such evidence led the Judge to the conclusion that Mr Lyu did not intend – by most of his transfers of funds – to benefit Ms Wei gratuitously.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Grounds of the appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Ms Wei appealed the Judge’s decision in respect of all eight claims on which Mr Lyu succeeded. Mr Lyu did not appeal the two claims on which he failed and, so, only eight claims were in issue before us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 For present purposes, Ms Wei’s grounds of her appeal are conveniently grouped around two subsets of those eight claims:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first group comprises Mr Lyu’s claims in respect of: (i) the D’Leedon apartment; (ii) the Car; (iii) the Cairnhill option; and (iv) the Marne Road shop. These claims are grouped together because they raise a common dispositive issue to which we will turn at [24]–[32] below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second group comprises Mr Lyu’s claims in respect of: (i) the first clinic investment; (ii) the US surrogacy; (iii) the second clinic investment; and (iv) the application for Grenadian citizenship. These claims do not have a common dispositive issue, but the issue arising in relation to each are of a similar character. We will explain this similarity at [19]–[23] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Before turning to explain the issues in respect of each group, we pause to highlight that in the Appellant’s Case

</div>
</div> there was some indication that Ms Wei’s appeal in respect of the Cairnhill option would raise issues which would straddle both groups. However, at the hearing before us, her counsel, Mr Mahesh Rai (“Mr Rai”), confirmed that this was not the case and that the Cairnhill option only fell within the first group, or what he described as the “resulting trust assets”. Accordingly, we only considered her appeal in relation to the Cairnhill option insofar as it related to the <span class="font-italic">first group</span> of claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first group of claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In respect of the claims falling within the first group, Ms Wei in this appeal abandoned her assertion that the sums used to acquire these assets were transferred to her as gifts <span class="font-italic">wholly</span> for her benefit (see [6] above). Instead, the ground of her appeal was that the Judge erred in determining that Mr Lyu lacked <span class="font-italic">any and all</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>intention to benefit her, even to a lesser degree (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, less than 100%). As Ms Wei put in her Appellant’s Case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16. The Judge found that a resulting trust arose over 100% of the D’Leedon apartment because Ms Wei had failed to prove Mr Lyu’s intention to gift the property completely to her. However, as argued … below, the contemporaneous evidence adduced before the Court shows that Mr Lyu undoubtedly had the intention for Ms Wei to possess some beneficial interest. Even if the Judge was not convinced that Mr Lyu had intended to gift Ms Wei with 100% of the beneficial interest in the property, a declaration that Ms Wei holds the entire property on resulting trust for Mr Lyu can only be upheld if the Judge was satisfied that there was a <span class="font-underline">complete</span> absence of intention by Mr Lyu to benefit Ms Wei.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17. The Judge adopted an all-or-nothing approach towards declaring the beneficial owner of D’Leedon Property because Ms Wei had regarded Mr Lyu’s financial contributions as a pledge of love towards her. This led to the Judge remarking that “[n]either party has contended that there is any question of shared ownership of the beneficial interest of any particular asset”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18.  However, regardless of Ms Wei’s genuine expectations during the relationship, the question of donative intent must be answered from Mr Lyu’s perspective. From the contemporaneous documents and Mr Lyu’s oral testimony itself, there is sufficient basis for the Court to draw the conclusion that Mr Lyu intended to benefit Ms Wei.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19. To this extent, Ms Wei seeks leave under Order 56A Rule 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) to introduce the new point <span class="font-italic">that Mr </span><span class="font-italic">Lyu had the donative intent to benefit her with at least 50% beneficial interest in the D’Leedon Property</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in underline; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On this footing, Ms Wei claimed that the evidence should be read to disclose a donative intention on Mr Lyu’s part to benefit Ms Wei with at least 50% of the beneficial interest in the D’Leedon apartment. In respect of this, Ms Wei recognised that this was not an issue canvassed at trial given that her case was that the money had been gifted to her<span class="font-italic"> wholly</span>. She thus stated that she was seeking this court’s leave under O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) to raise this as a “new point” on appeal.

</div>
</div> Issue was taken with this, and, in response, Mr Rai made three arguments. First, O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) uses the phrase “intends to apply <span class="font-italic">in the course of the hearing</span>”. Relying on this phrase, Mr Rai submitted that the court’s leave is not sought in the Appellant’s Case itself. Rather, it is sought at the hearing, and the requirement that an intention to seek such leave be stated in the Appellant’s Case served the more limited function of giving the opposing party notice. Mr Rai cited <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 121 (“<span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance</span>”) at [27], where the Court of Appeal permitted the appellant to raise a new point on the basis that “adequate notice” had been given to the respondent. Second, it was clear that Mr Lyu had adequate notice because, in his Respondent’s Case, he did in fact respond to the “new point” in relation to the Car, the Cairnhill option as well as the Marne Road shop. Lastly, in any event, the Appellant’s Skeletal Arguments made clear that O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) leave was being sought for all four assets, not just the D’Leedon apartment.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 At the hearing, we invited Mr Lyu’s counsel, Mr Lok Vi Ming SC (“Mr Lok”), to respond to these points. After an initial exchange, Mr Lok conceded that – although the Appellant’s Case did not specifically seek the court’s leave to do so – Mr Rai could still seek leave at the hearing to raise Ms Wei’s new point in respect of the Car, the Cairnhill option and the Marne Road shop. This was a fair concession from a reasonable construction of O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Order 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and the authorities do not preclude a party from seeking leave to raise a “new point” at the hearing of the appeal even when the “new point” had been omitted (as the case may be) in an appellant’s or respondent’s written case on appeal. The court’s overarching concern is that the other side is not ambushed by a “new point” raised late at the oral hearing. That being said, it should go without saying that allowing an appellant or respondent to seek leave is not the grant of leave itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 We turn to the following sentence in O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>): “[i]f a party intends to apply in the course of the hearing for leave to introduce a new point not taken in the Court below, this <span class="font-italic">should</span> be stated clearly in the Case” [emphasis added]. The question is whether the word “should” ought to be construed as a strict condition-precedent for seeking leave. In our view, the word “should” need not be interpreted as a condition-precedent for leave to be sought. This would be an unnecessary constraint; after all, even if the court permits an appellant or respondent to apply for leave in respect of a “new point” which was not included in their written case, it does not follow that leave will be granted. Indeed, appellants or respondents who omit to state their intention to seek leave under O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) clearly in their written cases do so at their own peril. As <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance</span> shows, the adequacy of notice is a relevant factor which the appellate court will take into account when assessing whether leave ought to be granted. Failing to indicate even one’s basic intention to seek leave under O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) will, in most cases, be fatal to the application for leave. Put differently, if an appellant or respondent fails to state his intention to apply for leave in his written case, and yet comes before an appellate court to seek such leave, he should be prepared to provide a very good explanation for his omission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In this case, Mr Rai confirmed at the hearing that Ms Wei was seeking leave to raise her “new point” (see [12]–[13] above) not just in respect of the D’Leedon apartment, but also the Car, the Cairnhill option and Marne Road shop. Therefore, the crucial issue which was before us in respect of the appeal concerning the first group of claims was whether Ms Wei should be granted leave to raise her “new point”.

At the hearing, we sought Mr Rai’s confirmation that this was an accurate understanding of the case on appeal, and he confirmed that it was. Accordingly, it was agreed that if Ms Wei’s application for leave was denied, her entire appeal against the Judge’s decision on the first group of claims would fall away. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 For completeness, and before we move on to set out the grounds of Ms Wei’s appeal in respect of the second group of claims, we turn to comment on two matters. First, in this case, Mr Lyu had ample notice of Ms Wei’s intention to raise her “new point” in relation to all four assets. As stated, the Respondent’s Case responded to Ms Wei’s new point.

</div> Secondly, we propose to explain the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Bintai</span><span class="font-italic"> Kindenko Pte Ltd v Samsung C&amp;T Corp and another</span> [2019] 2 SLR 295 (“<span class="font-italic">Bintai</span>”). There, it was remarked that, because of the appellant’s failure to seek the court’s leave to raise the new point in issue, its arguments on the point “could be dismissed on [that] basis alone” (at [66]). Before his concession (see [15] above), Mr Lok initially relied on this decision to resist Ms Wei’s attempt to raise her “new point” in relation to the Car, the Cairnhill option and the Marne Road shop, beyond the D’Leedon apartment. However, the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Bintai</span> simply did not seek the court’s leave, whether in writing or at the hearing (at [65]). As can be seen from the paragraphs above, this is distinct from the present case. We therefore make clear that there is a difference between omitting to indicate one’s intention to seek leave under O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and failing entirely to seek the court’s leave to raise a new point whether in writing or orally. As stated at [16] above, the former counts against the application for leave (which may still be made); but the latter, as the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Bintai</span>, may result in the dismissal of the new point without anything further.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second group of claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 This brings us to the second group of claims. In respect of these, Ms Wei challenges the legal bases by which the Judge arrived at his conclusions. More specifically, that he erred in determining that there was sufficient evidence to meet the relevant legal thresholds for establishing the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trusts (see the Judgment at [28]) or loan agreement he found to have existed (see the Judgment at [33]). For good order, <span class="font-italic">Barclays Bank Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Quistclose Investments Ltd </span>[1970] AC 567 (“<span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span>”), the namesake decision which established this as a type of trust, should be cited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In respect of the claims concerning the first clinic investment and the US surrogacy, the Judge had determined that either a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust existed or a restitutionary claim for unjust enrichment was established (see the Judgment at [75] and [76]). In the appeal, Ms Wei’s first contention was that there was not enough evidence to show that Mr Lyu intended for the funds he transferred to be applied <span class="font-italic">exclusively</span> to those purposes. On this basis, she submitted that a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust could not have arisen because, as the Judge himself recognised (see the Judgment at [27]), such exclusivity of purpose is a crucial requirement for this type of trust to arise.

</div> There was, however, a difference between this and the claims relating to the first clinic investment and the US surrogacy. As stated, in respect of the first clinic investment and the US surrogacy claims, the Judge expressly formulated his decision either on the basis of a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust or unjust enrichment. The legal basis of the Judge’s decision in respect of the second clinic investment, by contrast, was less clear. All the Judge said in this connection was that the transfer made to Ms Wei was “not a gift” but “for the purpose” of the second clinic investment. Thus, “when the purpose of the transfer failed, Ms Wei had to return [the money] to him” (see the Judgment at [89]). This could be understood as being premised on a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>trust, but the precise legal basis into which this translates is not wholly clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Last was the claim concerning the application for Grenadian citizenship. The Judge resolved this claim on the basis that Mr Lyu and Ms Wei had entered into a loan agreement. On appeal, Ms Wei contended that there was not enough evidence to demonstrate that Mr Lyu intended to create a creditor-debtor relationship which carried with it the “expectation that the amount transferred would be repayable on demand”. For these propositions as to the specific intention required to create a contract of loan, she referred to the decisions of <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng Tiah v Jiang Angelina</span> [2020] SGHC 65 (“<span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng Tiah</span>”) at [60] and <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 32 at [54].

Mr Rai confirmed that Ms Wei’s case at trial was not that she was entitled to a share of the money transferred by Mr Lyu, but rather, that she was entitled to it wholly and without conditions. Our own review of the Defence also satisfied us that Ms Wei’s position on appeal was not that which she had pleaded.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Two factors have led us to the conclusion that this new, so-called “point” should not be considered on appeal. First, the assertion that Mr Lyu’s transfers of funds were <span class="font-italic">wholly</span> gifts, and that the assets purchased in her name were also <span class="font-italic">wholly</span> gifts, was fundamentally at odds with the assertion that the transfers were for <span class="font-italic">their </span>joint benefit, of which Ms Wei is entitled to share in a part. Ms Wei’s case on appeal asserted quite a particular state of mind and it is one which the parties and the Judge should have had the opportunity to explore fully <span class="font-italic">at trial</span>. Whilst Mr Rai stated that Ms Wei did not need to adduce further evidence, and that she was content to rely on the record of appeal before the court, Mr Lyu certainly did not take the same position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 We preferred Mr Lyu’s position that rightly called for evidence to have been adduced and tested. Even if Ms Wei was content to rely on the record of appeal, we did not consider this to be appropriate. The evidence which she presented to the Judge needed to be tested in cross-examination with reference to the specific case she sought to advance on appeal. Conversely, as Mr Lok argued, it was also important for Mr Lyu to have had an opportunity to explain the messages exchanged between himself and Ms Wei, again, specifically in the context of her claim that such messages evinced an intention to share the sums transferred and assets acquired in a proportion which saw Ms Wei receiving at least 50%. We accepted Mr Lok’s submission. As the Judge very aptly put, the parties’ messages were “written in the language of love: larded with vows, suffused with sacrifice and stirred from time to time by anger or resentment. Such language is not always easy to render into the dry language of property law” (the Judgment at [2]). Our considered view was that it would have been prejudicial to Mr Lyu for us to have applied our lens to these exchanges without the parties’ explanations provided in the context that was different from their respective pleaded cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, and demonstrative of the first factor above, Ms Wei did not explain how she derived the 50% figure she asserted (see [12]–[13] above). We were not concerned with a division of matrimonial assets, and it was not for parties to simply suggest a figure which they considered would represent a just and equitable division of assets, nor was it the court’s function to make this assessment. Ms Wei needed to <span class="font-italic">prove</span> that Mr Lyu specifically intended for her to receive the benefit of at least 50% of the monies he had transferred. Given her case at trial (see [6] above), this was simply not an issue which would have crossed the minds of the parties and the Judge. There was therefore inadequate evidence that could shed light on the specific proportion of the share Mr Lyu allegedly intended Ms Wei to have, and the case which Ms Wei raised on appeal before us could not be determined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 These two factors were, in our judgment, sufficient to dismiss Ms Wei’s appeal in respect of the first group of claims. However, we should also highlight the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">JWR Pte Ltd v Edmond Pereira Law Corp and another</span> [2020] 2 SLR 744. There, the appellant<span class="font-italic"> </span>attempted to advance a new case on appeal (see [25]), and the apex court regarded such conduct as an abuse of the appeal process. The court noted that the appellant was not seeking to challenge the trial judge’s decision, with which it was dissatisfied; instead, by its new case, it was effectively seeking to conduct a second trial. To this, the court said (at [32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… We have reminded counsel in various appeals that they should not be coming before the Court of Appeal as if it were a second trial court and we hope we do not need to sound the same admonition against such abuse of the appeal process for future appeals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 At the hearing, we brought Mr Rai’s attention to this decision and invited submissions on where Ms Wei’s O 56A r 9(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) fell between the line of raising a new “point” and advancing an entirely new “case”. His submissions were directed at, but were not in our view, even remotely able to overcome the points we have made at [26]–[28] above. As stated, her application was, quite plainly, an attempt to advance a wholly new case, not merely a new point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In suitable cases, new points <span class="font-italic">may</span> be allowed on appeal. That being said, the appellant courts are guarded against parties who seek to raise such points inappropriately. The reason why leave is required in respect of a new point which a lower court did not have the opportunity to consider was put in a most careful and measured way by the learned Lord Chancellor, Lord Birkenhead in <span class="font-italic">North Staffordshire Railway Company v Edge</span> [1920] AC 254 at 263–264:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]here are very few cases of which it can be confidently stated that a failure to raise a relevant contention at the appropriate stage will not prejudice the other litigant. … I do not think it necessary to point out that this suggestion may possibly in another case require qualification or consideration, … [b]ut I desire to draw attention to a consideration which in my view is both more general and more important. The appellate system in this country is conducted in relation to certain well-known principles and by familiar methods. The issues of fact and law are orally presented by counsel. In the course of the argument it is the invariable practice of appellate tribunals to require that the judgments of the judges in the Courts below shall be read. <span class="font-italic">The efficiency and the authority of a Court of Appeal, and especially of a final Court of Appeal, are increased and strengthened by the opinions of learned judges who have considered these matters below</span>. To acquiesce in such an attempt as the appellants have made in this case is in effect to undertake decisions which may be of the highest importance without having received any assistance at all from the Judges in the Courts below. <span class="font-italic">I have carefully examined the cases upon the subject which have been decided in this House, and my examination of them has led me more and more to the conclusion </span><span class="font-italic">that such attempts must be vigilantly examined and seldom indulged</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the same vein, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Panwah</span><span class="font-italic"> Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 571 at [15] – to which Mr Lok referred us – cited the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">The Owners of the Ship “Tasmania” and the Owners of the Freight v Smith and others, The Owners of the Ship “City of Corinth” (The “Tasmania”)</span> (1890) 15 App Cas 223 with approval. There, the learned Lord Herschell said (at 225):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">My Lords, I think that a point such as this, not taken at the trial, and presented for the first time in the Court of Appeal, ought to be most jealously scrutinised. The conduct of a cause at the trial is governed by, and the questions asked of the witnesses are directed to, the points then suggested. And it is obvious that no care is exercised in the elucidation of facts not material to them.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It appears to me that under these circumstances a Court of Appeal ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a ground there put forward for the first time, if it be satisfied beyond doubt, first, that it has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as completely as would have been the case if the controversy had arisen at the trial; and next, that no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned if an opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the witness box.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Given the cautious approach the appellate courts take even towards the introduction of new <span class="font-italic">points</span>, there is no room for entirely new <span class="font-italic">cases</span> to be raised on appeal. Given that the latter was what Ms Wei sought to advance before us in respect of the first group of claims, we firmly dismissed her appeal in this regard, which we emphasise was an abuse of the appeal process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second group of claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We turn next to our decision in respect of the second group of claims. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The first clinic investment and the US surrogacy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As regards the claims relating to the first clinic investment and the US surrogacy, we deal first with Ms Wei’s submission that the Judge erred in determining that a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust arose. As stated at [20] above, her essential complaint was that the Judge took too loose an understanding of the requirement of “exclusivity” of purpose. Given this, the first question we needed to answer was what precisely such “exclusivity” entailed, and how it needed to be proven. Ms Wei referred us to two cases in this connection.

As Lord Millett observed ([<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Yardley</span> [2002] 2 AC 164] at [73]–[74]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73 A <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust does not necessarily arise merely because money is paid for a particular purpose. A lender will often inquire into the purpose for which a loan is sought in order to decide whether he would be justified in making it. He may be said to lend the money for the purpose in question, but this is not enough to create a trust; once lent the money is at the free disposal of the borrower. Similarly payments in advance for goods or services are paid for a particular purpose, but such payments do not ordinarily create a trust.

</div>
</div> The approach which Mr Rai took at the oral hearing before us mirrored Ms Wei’s written case. He placed emphasis on the broad threshold requirements; namely, that Mr Lyu needed to establish that the transfers he made to Ms Wei were for a <span class="font-italic">specified</span>, <span class="font-italic">exclusive</span> purpose, and, on the flip side, that the money transferred was <span class="font-italic">not at </span><span class="font-italic">her free disposal</span>. Mr Lok’s approach was similar to that taken by Mr Rai. When we questioned him on this issue at the hearing, he accepted that Mr Lyu bore the burden of proving the specific and exclusive purpose or purposes for which the transfers to Ms Wei were made. However, he did not elaborate on what was necessary to demonstrate “specificity”, “exclusivity” and the absence of a right of “free disposal”, for a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust to arise. Instead, like Mr Rai, his submissions focused on the characterisation of the objective evidence on record.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Although this general statement of the law was not inaccurate, it was somewhat superficial and that, we thought, was slightly unfortunate. We fully appreciated that the underlying dispute was to be resolved on the available evidence in this case. However, even so, it would still have behoved counsel for both parties to have referred us to more precise authorities demonstrating the degree of evidential rigour to which prior courts have subjected plaintiffs seeking to assert a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust. Though the notions of “specific purpose”, “exclusivity” and the absence of a right of “free disposal” are clear indications of a trust, they can accommodate considerable ambiguity in respect of the <span class="font-italic">amount</span> and <span class="font-italic">quality</span> of evidence which courts ought to require of plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For example, in <span class="font-italic">Eleftheriou</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Costi and another </span>[2013] EWHC 2168 (Ch), Mr Simon Barker QC (sitting as a judge of the High Court) considered it a “fatal blow” that the transferors failed to stipulate that the transferee keep the money he received in a separate bank account (at [71]). Conversely, in <span class="font-italic">Re English &amp; American Insurance Co Ltd </span>[1994] 1 BCLC 649, Harman J was persuaded that a trust arose over certain funds held by an insolvent insurance company, crucially, because the agreement governing the company’s receipt of those funds provided not only that they be applied exclusively to the purposes set out in the agreement, but <span class="font-italic">also</span> that they be segregated. In a more general vein, Watkins LJ in <span class="font-italic">R v Clowes and another (No 2)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1994] 2 All ER 316 (“<span class="font-italic">Clowes</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2)</span>”) quoted a passage from the decision of Channell J in <span class="font-italic">Henry v Hammond</span> [1913] 2 KB 515 at 521:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is clear that if the terms upon which the person receives the money are that he is bound to keep it separate, either in a bank or elsewhere, and to hand that money so kept as a separate fund to the person entitled to it, then he is a trustee of that money and must hand it over to the person who is his cestui que trust. If on the other hand he is not bound to keep the money separate, but is entitled to mix it with his own money and deal with it as he pleases, and when called upon to hand over an equivalent sum of money, then, in my opinion, he is not a trustee of the money, but merely a debtor. All the authorities seem to me to be consistent with that statement of the law. I agree with the observation of Bramwell L.J. in <span class="font-italic">New Zealand and </span><span class="font-italic">Australian Land Co. v. Watson</span> [(1881) 7 QBD 374] when he said that he would be very sorry to see the intricacies and doctrines connected with trusts introduced into commercial transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Affirming this, Watkins LJ suggested that the following approach be adopted – in cases like these – to determine whether a trust might have arisen over funds which are transferred in connection with some specified purpose or use (<span class="font-italic">Clowes</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2) </span>at 325):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Those propositions of Channell J have stood the test of time. … As to segregation of funds, the effect of the authorities seems to be that a requirement to keep moneys separate is normally an indicator that they are impressed with a trust, and that the absence of such a requirement, if there are no other indicators of a trust, <span class="font-italic">normally</span> negatives it. The fact that a transaction contemplates the mingling of funds is, therefore, not necessarily fatal to a trust.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee and Steven Elliott gen eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell</span>”) also appear to give particular credence to the quality of the inference drawn (as to the transferor’s intention to preclude the transferee’s free disposal) where the transfer is made upon the condition that the money be segregated (see para 25-034):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A’s intention needs to be communicated to B so that it is clear to B that the monies must be returned if A’s purpose cannot be fulfilled. It is not fatal to finding the required intention that A contemplates that the money may eventually be mingled with B’s general funds. <span class="font-italic">But a requirement that the money </span><span class="font-italic">is to be kept unmixed in a special account strengthens the inference that B does not have it at his free disposal, and that he is not a simple contract debtor</span>. Unless A’s intention to restrict B’s free disposal of the money is demonstrated, then the money ordinarily belongs beneficially to B. This is consistent with the true default position that the transfer of the legal title ordinarily carries with it the beneficial interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added; footnotes omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 We note from Watkins LJ’s speech as well as <span class="font-italic">Snell</span> that there is, at least strictly speaking, no need for segregation to infer the necessary intention for a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust to arise. However, the frequency with which it appears in the reasoning of judges – indeed, segregation was part of the factual matrix of <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> itself – seems to suggest not only that it carries a particular weight, but also, that there exists a relatively high evidential burden to prove that segregation was at least contemplated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 That said, it does not seem to us that the courts have uniformly applied the same, generally rigorous expectations of proof. The most useful example is the leading decision of <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Yardley</span> [2002] 2 AC 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span>”). There, a solicitor, Leach, was engaged to act for Yardley in connection with the purchase of land. To complete the purchase, Yardley needed to borrow £1m. Twinsectra was willing to lend this sum subject to the provision of certain undertakings. Twinsectra did not deal with Yardley but instead, another firm of solicitors, Sims &amp; Roper of Dorset (“Sims”), whom Yardley separately instructed because Leach was unwilling to provide the undertakings required by Twinsectra. Sims provided Twinsectra with the undertakings it sought and, in turn, they received £1m. The terms of the undertaking Sims provided were:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. The loan moneys will be retained by [Sims] until such time as they are applied in the acquisition of property on behalf of [Mr Yardley]. 2. The loan moneys will be utilised solely for the acquisition of property on behalf of [Mr Yardley] and for no other purpose. 3. [Sims] will repay to [Twinsectra] the said sum of £1m together with interest calculated at the rate of £657.53 per day … such repayment to be made [within four calendar months after receipt of the loan moneys by [Sims]].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In breach of these undertakings, Sims paid the money to Leach upon receiving Yardley’s assurance that the money would be applied to purchase the relevant property. Leach also did not take steps to ensure that the money was used solely to complete the purchase; instead, he released the funds to Yardley on his instructions. In consequence, Yardley applied around £360,000 of the borrowed funds to purposes other than the purchase of the property. Twinsectra’s essential claim was that Sims held the £1m on trust, and had breached that trust when it paid it out to Leach contrary to the terms of its undertaking. Leach, in connection, was said to have dishonestly assisted Sims’ breach of that trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the High Court, Carnwath J (as he then was) rejected the contention that Sims held the money on trust for Twinsectra for want of certainty of intention and object. In his view, the “vague terms” of the undertaking did not disclose an intention to create a trust, and it also did not specify the particular property to which the £1m could have been validly applied (<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at [14] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Hoffmann). The Court of Appeal reversed this decision and also found that Leach had acted dishonestly. Leach was the only appellant to the House of Lords, and he contended that the Court of Appeal had erred in finding him liable for dishonest assistance. The Lords overturned the Court of Appeal on the issue of dishonest assistance, but more pertinent for present purposes, Lord Millett did not agree with Carnwath J that the terms of the undertaking were vague. On the contrary, he said at [75]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the present case paragraphs 1 and 2 of the undertaking are <span class="font-italic">crystal clear</span>. Mr Sims undertook that the money would be used solely for the acquisition of property and for no other purpose; and was to be retained by his firm until so applied. It would not be held by Mr Sims simply to Mr Yardley’s order; and it would not be at Mr Yardley's free disposition. Any payment by Mr Sims of the money, whether to Mr Yardley or anyone else, otherwise than for the acquisition of property would constitute a breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Then, in rounding off on this issue, his Lordship said at [99]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There is clearly <span class="font-italic">a wide range of situations</span> in which the parties enter into a commercial arrangement <span class="font-italic">which permits one party to have a limited use of the other</span><span class="font-italic">’s money for a stated purpose, is not free to apply it for any other purpose</span>, and must return it if for any reason the purpose cannot be carried out. The arrangement between the purchaser’s solicitor and the purchaser’s mortgagee is an example of just such an arrangement. All such arrangements should if possible be susceptible to the same analysis.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 A question to which <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> gives rise, however, is whether – in this “wide range” of circumstances by which parties may restrict the purposes for which transferred monies may be used – there needs to be an <span class="font-italic">express</span> declaration or agreement that the money is only to be used for an exclusive purpose (or purposes). In <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span>, it was undertaken that “[t]he loan moneys [would] be utilised solely for the acquisition of property” (see [44] above). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Re EVTR, Gilbert and another v Barber</span> [1987] BCLC 646 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">EVTR</span>”), a case cited by Lord Millett in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at [89], money was advanced to solicitors with written authority to release the money “for the sole purpose of buying new equipment” (see 650a–b).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Again, it appears, the authorities do not all point one way. In <span class="font-italic">Templeton Insurance Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Penningtons Solicitors LLP and others</span> [2006] EWHC 685 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Templeton</span>”), the defendant solicitors also provided an undertaking on behalf of their client to secure a loan of £500,000. A term of this undertaking provided that, “[i]f completion of the purchase [was] delayed for more than 14 days the said sum [would] be placed in a designated client deposit account to earn interest for you until completion” (at [3]). Lewison J (as he then was) considered it “plain” from this undertaking – particularly, the words “for you” – that a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust arose (at [7]). The undertaking there was certainly not as forthright as those in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> or <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">EVTR</span>, and thus, it appears that the evidential threshold which Lewison J had in mind was not particularly high. No expression of specific intention was required, and the learned judge was content to infer the requisite intention from the broader formulation of the solicitors’ undertaking. Evans-Lombe J seemed to take a similar view in <span class="font-italic">Cooper v PRG Powerhouse Ltd and others</span> [2008] 2 All ER (Comm) 964 (“<span class="font-italic">Cooper</span>”). There, he suggested (at [15]) that it was sufficient to show “that the arrangement pursuant to which the payment was made defined the purpose for which it was made in such a <span class="font-italic">way that it was understood by the recipient that it was not at his free disposal</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Underhill and Hayton: Law of Trusts and Trustees</span> (Charles Mitchell, Paul Matthews, Jonathan Harris &amp; Sinéad Agnew eds) (LexisNexis, 20th Ed, 2022) – drawing cases like <span class="font-italic">Templeton </span>and <span class="font-italic">Cooper</span> together, amongst others – suggest generally that (at para 27.6):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To bring a case within the scope of the … <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> principle it seems the parties need not have expressly agreed that the money should be applied for a ‘sole purpose’ or ‘exclusive purpose’, provided that this is the substance of their arrangement, and that it was understood by the borrower that the money was not at his free disposal. Nor does it matter if the relevant purpose is couched in broad terms … or described more precisely, provided that it is expressed sufficiently clearly for a court to be able to say of any application of the money that it does or does not fall within the terms of the power given to the borrower. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[footnotes omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The long and short of the foregoing discussion is this. By requiring less or more evidence of a lower or higher quality, the court may circumscribe or expand the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust doctrine. The place at which one lands in this regard depends on the position from which one begins. Cases in which <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trusts have typically been asserted are those involving loans for a particular purpose, with the dispute arising because the borrower does not apply the funds to that specific purpose <span class="font-italic">and</span> later becoming insolvent. One may view cases like these with a certain scepticism and be concerned that what the party asserting the <span class="font-italic">Quist</span><span class="font-italic">close</span> is trying to do, is circumvent ordinary priority in insolvency. If so, one is more likely to apply a rigorous evidential lens, but, even then, as the foregoing discussion shows, not all courts have chosen to begin their analysis from this position <span class="font-italic">even</span> in commercial cases involving insolvency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 This brings us back to the present case. If the extent of evidential rigour to which even commercial cases have been subjected has not been uniformly high, there must necessarily be less room for such rigour in cases like the present involving <span class="font-italic">voluntary</span> transfers of money between individuals in a private non-commercial setting. The law has traditionally taken a sceptical view of such transfers; for example, by shifting the evidential burden of proof, as in the operation of the presumed resulting trust. Alternatively, it may – as was appropriate in this case – require less by way of rigorous proof that money transferred was not intended to be a gift, but rather, to be used exclusively for specified purposes such that the recipient did not have free disposal of the money transferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Seen through this lens, we were satisfied that the evidence presented by Mr Lyu made out a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust in respect of the money he transferred to be used in connection with the first clinic investment and the US surrogacy. We were persuaded by the fact that Ms Wei was the one who asked Mr Lyu to transfer her some money to be spent on three items: (a) the first clinic investment; (b) the US surrogacy; and (c) the Cairnhill option. Initially, Mr Lyu expressed concerns over the amount of money he was spending on their relationship in general. In response, Ms Wei persuaded him that she was being as effective as possible in her usage of the funds, stating that the cost of the US surrogacy alone was initially S$1.4 million, but that she had managed to allocate this sum towards all three items. Her salient messages read:

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Appellant’s Case (18 Apr 2022) at para 69.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This, Mr Rai submitted, suggested that Mr Lyu did not intend the money to be applied <span class="font-italic">exclusively </span>for the three items; after all, if he had such an intention, one would expect him to express at least some objection. To be clear, Mr Rai was not suggesting that Mr Lyu’s subsequent passivity should be construed as a waiver of the trust, or an estoppel by conduct. His submission was that Mr Lyu’s subsequent conduct ought to inform our inference of his intention at the point of the transfer. We did not accept this. In our view, the exchanges between Mr Lyu and Ms Wei <span class="font-italic">before</span> the transfer supported the stronger inference as to Mr Lyu’s intention than his subsequent lack of objection to Ms Wei using the money transferred for other purposes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Although we dismissed Ms Wei’s contention that the Judge erred in determining that a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust arose in respect of the money transferred for the first clinic investment and the US surrogacy, and this was sufficient to affirm the Judge’s decision on these claims, for completeness, we should address the alternative basis for the Judge’s decision. As stated at [20] above, the Judge offered two legal bases for his decision: a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust or a claim for unjust enrichment. In respect of the latter, Ms Wei contended that the Judge failed to consider her defence that her position had changed. Indeed, at [32] of the Judgment, the Judge noted that she raised this, but only briefly stated that “it would not be inequitable” for Ms Wei to repay the sums of money to Mr Lyu for the first clinic and the US surrogacy ([75] and [76] of the Judgment). However, there was no discussion of the defence in the Judgment. That being said, Ms Wei did not go further in this appeal than the bare assertion that she had raised the defence. She only made mention of the Judge’s failure to consider the defence in one line of her Skeletal Arguments, and the submission did not feature in her Appellant’s Case.

</div>
</div> There was therefore little we could make of this point and, accordingly, it was not a reason to disturb the Judge’s alternative basis for his decision in respect of these two claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The second clinic investment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Next is the appeal regarding the second clinic investment. We noted at [21] above that the precise legal basis of the Judge’s decision was not clear. Accordingly, we referred to the pleadings. It is most convenient to set out the relevant paragraphs of Mr Lyu’s Statement of Claim and Reply concerning the second clinic investment, as well as Ms Wei’s Defence, in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Statement of Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15. With respect to the monies of RMB 500,000 (approx. SGD 100,000) to be applied towards the purchase of a clinic in Singapore sometime in May 2018, the planned purchase had never materialised. Of the RMB 500,000 intended to have been applied towards the first tranche of the payment of SGD 100,000, the Plaintiff has secured the benefit of SGD 60,000 and the remainder SGD 40,000 was borrowed by the Defendant who promised to repay the same. The sum of SGD 40,000 is due and payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Defence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10(j). Wei eventually found the investment at the dental clinic to be unsuitable, as Lyu did not succeed in obtaining an employment pass despite two attempts. As such, she did not proceed with the purchase. Lyu was kept informed of Wei’s decision, and did not request for any part of the monetary gifts back.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reply</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11(h). Paragraph 10(j) of the Defence is not admitted. The Plaintiff avers that he had requested for the return of the monies and the Defendant had returned the sum of S$60,000.00 to the Plaintiff's possession when he requested for the same and the remainder S$40,000.00 was borrowed by the Defendant who promised to repay the same.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It can be seen from the quoted pleadings that in Mr Lyu’s Statement of Claim, he averred that the money transferred was “to be applied towards the purchase of a clinic in Singapore”, but that this planned purchase “never materialised”. This <span class="font-italic">seem</span><span class="font-italic">ed</span> to suggest that he was asserting the existence of a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust, and indeed, the sole ground on which Ms Wei challenged the Judge’s decision in respect of this claim was that he erred in determining that a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust had been supportable by the facts before him. However, we did not agree that this is what Mr Lyu was asserting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It can be seen that later in this same paragraph of his Statement of Claim, the focus of Mr Lyu shifted. He stated with relative clarity that Ms Wei returned S$60,000 of the S$100,000 initially transferred but asked to borrow the remaining S$40,000, to which Mr Lyu agreed on account of the fact that she “promised to repay the same”. In his Reply, the word “borrowed” was used again. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 On balance, we considered that the more accurate reading of Mr Lyu’s pleadings was that he had been asserting the existence of a loan agreement. The initial hints of a potential <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust had to be read with the rest of his pleadings about a borrowing. A loan being the legal basis of his claim, the onus lay on him to prove that there existed such an agreement for a loan. It was not correct for the Judge to determine that the transfer was “not a gift” and, thereafter, to order the repayment of S$40,000 on the basis that the “purpose of the transfer failed” (see the Judgment at [89]). As the judge in <span class="font-italic">Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd (in receivership) v </span><span class="font-italic">Intraco Ltd and others</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 382 stated, citing the decisions of <span class="font-italic">Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Southport Corporation</span> [1956] AC 218, <span class="font-italic">Panding</span><span class="font-italic"> v London Brick Co Ltd </span>[1971] 10 KIR 207 and <span class="font-italic">Lloyde</span><span class="font-italic"> v West Midlands Gas Board </span>[1971] 1 WLR 749, “[a] court may not make a finding or give a decision based on facts not pleaded and a finding or decision so made will be set aside” (at [24(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The unfortunate effect of Mr Lyu’s convoluted pleaded case is that the Judge made no finding as to the existence of a loan agreement in connection with the second clinic investment. Given our reading of the pleadings, such a finding was needed for Mr Lyu’s claim to succeed and, in its absence, the claim had no basis to succeed. We accordingly set aside the Judge’s decision in respect of the second clinic investment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The application for Grenadian citizenship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Finally, we turn to the application for Grenadian citizenship. We did not accept Ms Wei’s contention that there was insufficient evidential basis for the Judge to have concluded that there existed a loan agreement. We carefully considered [79] to [83] of the Judgment and we took the view that the Judge was accepting Mr Lyu’s evidence over Ms Wei’s. Mr Lyu’s evidence, as set out in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief – and which he maintained at trial – was that Ms Wei requested a loan of US$400,000 from him for the purpose of applying for Grenadian citizenship for herself and her four children. He was very specific that the money was transferred <span class="font-italic">as a loan</span>. Accepting this account of the facts – and indeed, nothing raised by Ms Wei reasonably suggested to us that her account should objectively have been preferred over Mr Lyu’s – there was a clear and adequate evidential basis for the Judge’s finding that the transfer of funds used by Ms Wei and her children to obtain Grenadian citizenship was made pursuant to a loan agreement. On this basis, we dismissed Ms Wei’s appeal in respect of this claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In summary, we dismissed Ms Wei’s appeal: (a) for the first group of claims; and (b) for the second group of claims except for one. For the reasons at [59]–[63] above, we considered it appropriate to set aside the Judge’s decision in respect of the second clinic investment and, accordingly, to reduce the Judge’s order that Ms Wei repay Mr Lyu the sum of S$354,684.22 by S$40,000. We directed that the remaining orders made by the Judge, as set out in the Judgment at [94], were to stand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the round, we observe that there was nothing raised by Ms Wei which seriously warranted appellate intervention. Half the case she raised on appeal was a departure from that which was advanced at trial, and the other half pressed points without suggesting that real errors were made by the Judge. In the premises, there was no reason for us to find that the Judge had erred in his findings save for the one claim mentioned above. We awarded Mr Lyu S$45,000 (all-in) in costs and directed that the usual consequential orders would apply.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Belinda Ang Saw Ean<br/>Judge of the Appellate Division</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Woo Bih Li<br/>Judge of the Appellate Division</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mahesh Rai s/o Vedprakash Rai and Samuel Soo Kuok Heng (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lok Vi Ming SC and Qabir Singh Sandhu (LVM Law Chambers LLC) (instructed), Chong Xin Yi and Tan Lena (Gloria James Civetta &amp; Co) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
