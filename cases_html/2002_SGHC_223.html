<font face="Univers (W1),Arial" xmlns="">

        I have before me an originating motion filed by

Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil Engineering Contractor Pte Ltd (‘the

contractors’) for an order that Mr John Chung be removed as Arbitrator in an

arbitration between the contractors and Scotts Development (Saraca) Pte Ltd (‘the

developers’). The application is made pursuant to s 17(1) of the Arbitration Act (Cap

10) (‘the Act’) on the ground that the Arbitrator has misconducted himself

and/or the arbitration proceedings. It is opposed by the developers but the arbitrator

himself has taken no part in the proceedings.</font>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The works and the claims</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        In September 1995, the developers engaged the

contractors to construct a housing project at Saraca Road/Begonia Road, Singapore

(‘the works’). The contract price was $17,861,724.20 as adjusted in accordance

with the contract; the contract period was 50 weeks; the original completion date was 18

October 1996 and liquidated damages were payable at $8,000 per day of delay.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        The works were not completed on time. As such,

on 21 October 1996, the architect issued a Delay Certificate (the ‘Original Delay

Certificate’) in accordance with clause 23 of the contract. This started the clock

running for the payment of liquidated damages from 18 October 1996 up to the completion of

the works. Thereafter, on three separate occasions, the architect granted extensions of

time, totalling 130 days in all, successively extending the completion date.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        Three Termination of Delay Certificates were

issued by the architect to effect the grants of extension of time and three Further Delay

Certificates were also issued as the works remained incomplete by the respective extended

contract completion dates. By his successive grants of extensions of time, the architect

reduced the contractors’ liability for liquidated damages by some $1,040,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        In the course of the works, the architect also

issued various certificates for payment in favour of the contractors. The developers paid

all of these certified sums save for a sum of $1,729,561.80 which they withheld on account

of the liquidated damages that had accrued pursuant to the Delay Certificates.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        On the face of the architect’s

certificates as they currently stand, the developers owe the contractors $1,729,561.80 as

payment for works done and the contractors in turn owe the developers $4,511,456.68 for

liquidated damages up to 4 November 1998.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Recovery proceedings –

initial steps</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        The contractors disputed the developers’

deduction of $1,729,561.80 and sought to recover that amount. In February 1999, they

commenced High Court Suit No. 284 of 1999. In this action, they sought a declaration that

the Original Delay Certificate, the first two Termination of Delay Certificates and the

first two Further Delay Certificates were invalid and that the deduction of liquidated

damages by the developers based on those delay certificates was also invalid. They claimed

the deducted sum of $1,729,561.80. The contractors applied for summary judgment on their

claim and the developers applied for the proceedings to be stayed pending arbitration. The

developers also resisted the summary judgment application on the basis that all

certificates issued were valid and the sum of $1,729,561.80 had been properly deducted.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        The Assistant Registrar granted an order in

terms of the contractors’ summary judgment application. The developers appealed

successfully and the Judge set aside the judgment and stayed further proceedings in the

action pending arbitration.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        On 5 April 2000, the contractors gave notice of

arbitration. In May 2000, Mr John Chung (whom the contractors had nominated) was appointed

as arbitrator. In the arbitration proceedings, the contractors are claiming, amongst other

things, additional time to complete the works, damages for loss and expense arising from

delays in the works (for which the contractors are alleging the developers and/or their

agents were responsible) and outstanding payments for the works. The amounts claimed

include the amount of $1,729,561.80 certified due by the architect but withheld on the

basis of the Delay Certificates issued.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Initial proceedings in the

arbitration</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        On 21 July 2000, the arbitrator gave directions

for the filing of pleadings by the parties. At that time, the contractors were represented

by Messrs Rajah &amp; Tann whilst the developers were represented by Messrs Wong Tan &amp;

Molly Lim. The contractors duly filed their points of claim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        Some time thereafter, the developers changed

lawyers and appointed Messrs Wong Partnership as their new solicitors. On 11 April 2001,

the developers’ points of defence and counterclaim were filed on their behalf by

their new solicitors. On reading the points of defence and counterclaim, the contractors

took the view that the developers had changed their position on the validity of the

Termination of Delay Certificates and the Further Delay Certificates and were thus no

longer entitled to set off their liquidated damages claim against the entire sum claimed

by the applicants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        On 29 June 2001, the contractors made an

application to the arbitrator requesting that certain issues be tried as preliminary

issues. Eight issues were put forward for consideration to be tried as preliminary issues

and they covered a variety of matters. The developers objected to having the preliminary

issues tried.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        A hearing took place on 13 August 2001 for the

arbitrator to determine whether he should hear the preliminary issues. The developers

objected to various matters being tried as preliminary issues on the basis that the same

were not fit for summary determination. They contended that the issues relied on a host of

disputed or assumed facts and if the actual facts found were different, the preliminary

determination would be rendered nugatory.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        On 24 August 2001, the arbitrator informed

parties that he had decided, after due consideration, not to hear the preliminary issues

as he was not convinced that to do so would result in a substantial saving of time and

costs.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Application for interim award</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        The contractors were not happy with this

decision because it meant that it would be some time before the arbitration proper would

be held. In the meantime, they would continue to be held out of receipt of $1,729,561.80

on the basis of Further Delay Certificates which certificates they believed the

contractors had now admitted to be invalid. The contractors found this situation to be

unacceptable.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        On 17 October 2001, therefore, the contractors

applied for an interim award in the sum of $1,729,561.80. According to the contractors,

the application was made pursuant to the terms of the contract that provide that payment

certificates should be given full effect by way of summary judgment or interim award

(namely clauses 31(11) and 37(3)(h) of the SIA Conditions) and on the basis that the

developers’ change of position in relation to the validity of the Termination and

Further Delay Certificates reopened the whole issue of whether the developers had a valid

right of set off to justify non-payment of the Certificates of Payment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        In correspondence, the employers raised

preliminary objections to the application for interim award by arguing that the principle

of <i>res judicata</i> applied in that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1)    the

    application for interim award was precluded from being heard by virtue of the application

    for summary judgment for similar relief having been heard in the High Court suit and a

    stay of proceedings having been ordered;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2)    the

    contractors were effectively asking the arbitration to consider issues which the

    arbitrator had, by his decision in respect of the application for a hearing of preliminary

    issues, already decided not to hear.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">They also made certain arguments

relating to the substance of the contractors’ application.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        Following further correspondence between the

solicitors for the respective parties and the arbitrator to clarify the purpose of the

proposed hearing, the arbitrator agreed to hear the employers’ preliminary objections

before deciding whether to hear the contractors’ application. In his letter of 9

November 2001, the arbitrator stated: ‘I will hear the [employers’] objections

to the [contractors’] application first before deciding whether to hear the

[contractors’] application, which I will fix on another day’. </font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Hearing on 4 January 2002</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        The hearing referred to in the letter of 9

November 2001 eventually took place on 4 January 2002. It was attended by the parties and

their respective solicitors and lasted about 3 hours. The employers’ counsel, Mr

Wong Meng Meng, SC, submitted first, followed by the contractors’ counsel, Mr

Sundaresh Menon. Mr Wong then replied. Mr Menon then sought to, and did, make further

submissions. The arbitrator afforded Mr Menon this opportunity despite objections by Mr

Wong.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        Mr Wong made oral submissions. He also put in

an eight page written submission. The first four paragraphs of this document read:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘<u>I. INTRODUCTION</u></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1. The Claimants [ie the

    contractors] have applied for an interim award for the principal sum of $1,729,561.80,

    being the liquidated damages deducted by the Respondents [ie the employers].</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2. The Respondents’

    preliminary objections are that the application is barred by res judicata/issue estoppel

    and it amounts to a collateral attack on the earlier decision of the Arbitrator on 24

    August 2001 when you disallowed the Claimants’ application for preliminary issues to

    be decided.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3. Alternatively, the Respondents

    say that the issues in the present application are not appropriate for summary disposal.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4. Even if the Claimants surmount

    the res judicata/issue estoppel/ collateral attack hurdle, the Respondents say the

    application should be dismissed on the merits. This will, of course, be dealt with in a

    separate hearing if the Arbitrator decides to hear the Claimants’ application, and

    the Respondents reserve the right to file further affidavits dealing with the substantive

    matters raised in the Claimants’ application and affidavit.’</font><u></u></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        According to Ms Elly Tham, one of the

solicitors for the developers, Mr Wong’s oral submissions focussed more on the point

that the issues were not suitable for summary determination while a large part of Mr

Menon’s oral submissions dealt with the issue of <i>res judicata</i>. Mr Menon also

put in written submissions and in this document counsel dealt with the two issues raised

by the employers’ solicitors in their correspondence. The written submissions also

stated that for the purpose of the hearing the contractors would address only those issues

and would not address the merits of their intended application.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        According to Ms Tham, having said that, Mr

Menon did submit on the point of suitability of the matters for summary disposal and did

so by citing two relevant cases which had been referred to by Mr Wong. He submitted that

the issues of waiver and validity of Delay Certificates could and should be the object of

summary proceedings. Mr Menon also submitted that whether these two cases were

straightforward as contended by Mr Wong should be dealt with when the interim award

application proper came to be heard.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        The hearing took place on a Friday. On Monday,

7 January, counsel for the contractors sent the arbitrator a letter. The purpose of this

letter was to set out what were described as ‘some of the key points made by Mr Menon

in his closing oral remarks’ so that the same would be on record. In this letter, the

arbitrator was reminded that the hearing had been solely on the developers’

objections to the contractors’ application being heard. It also stated that all

submissions put forward on the suitability or otherwise of the case for summary disposal

‘necessarily entail an incursion <i>(sic)</i> into the merits – something we

have not been able to address you on as yet’.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The arbitrator’s decision

and its consequences</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        On 8 January 2002, the arbitrator notified the

parties that he did not consider it appropriate to hear the application for an interim

award. His letter stated:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘Having considered the

    matter, I am of the view that it would not be appropriate at this juncture to hear the

    application for an Interim Award. The Claimants’ application is premised on the

    Respondents’ position, as set out in the Points of Defence and Counterclaim, that the

    architect should not have issued the Termination of Delay Certificates and the Further

    Delay Certificates. To succeed in their application for an Interim Award for the release

    of monies alleged to have been wrongfully deducted by the Claimants pursuant to the Delay

    Certificates dated 21 October 1996, the Claimants would have to challenge the validity of

    the said Delay Certificates. The validity of the Delay Certificate, together with the

    Claimants’ entitlement to any extensions of time are the main issues in the

    arbitration. To determine the validity of the Delay Certificate, I would have to hear the

    evidence of all the facts and circumstances leading to its issue. As such, the ruling I

    would have to make must necessarily be final and not interim in nature. An Interim Award

    on the validity of the Delay Certificate must in fact be the Final Award. The validity of

    the Delay Certificate should therefore be determined at the full arbitration

    hearing.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        The contractors were, as they expressed it,

astonished by the arbitrator’s decision not to hear their application and especially

the reasoning underlying that decision. Their lawyers were not, however, so shocked as to

be rendered incapable of speech and they immediately proceeded to write a lengthy letter

to the arbitrator to persuade him to change his mind. They gave him the reasons why they

thought that he had seriously erred in his decision and invited him to reconsider his

ruling. The employers’ solicitors then wrote to the arbitrator and supported his

decision. The contractors’ solicitors responded by a letter which in their view

refuted all the allegations made by the employers’ solicitors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        On 14 January, the arbitrator advised parties

that he had reconsidered the matter and decided that his ruling of 8 January would stand.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        The contractors and their solicitors took the

view that there had been a breach of natural justice in that the arbitrator had decided on

the merits of the application for an interim award when the hearing of 4 January had been

for the purpose only of considering the preliminary objections to the application. At that

stage, however, the contractors did not take out an application to remove the arbitrator.

Instead, their solicitors wrote to the arbitrator on 16 January asking for a scheduled

hearing for the giving of directions to be postponed while they considered how to proceed.

They also asked for a copy of the arbitrator’s notes of the 4<sup>th</sup> January

hearing and that he clarify whether there were any particular reasons underlying his

decision not to reverse his earlier ruling.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.

        Over the next few days, more letters were sent

by both parties to the arbitrator. On 21 January, the arbitrator informed the

contractors’ solicitors that his notes were for his own reference and he had no

intention of disclosing them. He did not clarify his reasons for not reversing his

decision. On 24 January, the contractors informed the arbitrator, through their

solicitors, that they viewed his decision of 8 January 2002 and subsequent events as a

serious breach of natural justice and had lost all confidence in his ability to conduct

the proceeding in a ‘transparent, fair and balanced manner’. They requested that

he discharge himself as arbitrator. On 25 January, the arbitrator responded by advising

both parties to continue with the reference.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.

        The contractors then sought an opinion from a

Queen’s Counsel on the conduct of the arbitrator. The opinion they received on 6

February stated that the arbitrator’s conduct had constituted misconduct. The

contractors sent this opinion to the arbitrator and asked him again to discharge himself.

The arbitrator replied that he intended to continue with the reference. This was not the

end of the matter and both parties continued to bombard the arbitrator with letters.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.

        On 25 February, the contractors informed the

arbitrator that they intended to make an application to court to remove him under s17 of

the Act. They asked the arbitrator whether he wished to be joined as a defendant or to

otherwise participate in the proceedings. The arbitrator declined this invitation on the

same day.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The law</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.

        There is no dispute on the law applicable to

this application. It is founded on s 17 of the Act which states:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is no statutory definition

of what constitutes ‘misconduct’ but this term has been discussed in many cases

and academic texts and there is a clear understanding of what it means in relation to the

behaviour of an arbitrator in respect of himself or the proceedings. It should be noted at

once that to find misconduct on the part of the arbitrator does not of itself impute any

slur on his character. Misconduct can be found in respect of the technical handling of the

arbitration and need not be a matter of bias or prejudice or other disreputable action on

the part of the arbitrator.</font></p>

        <i>Halsbury’s Laws of England</i> (4<sup>th</sup>

Ed Reissue) vol 2 in paragraph 694 states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<i><p align="justify"></p></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘Misconduct has been

    described as "such a mishandling of arbitration as its likely to amount to some

    substantial miscarriage of justice". Most cases depend as much upon the terms of

    reference and on the surrounding circumstances as upon the conduct of the arbitrator and

    it is therefore difficult to provide an exhaustive definition of the term.</font>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Where an arbitrator fails to

    comply with the terms, express or implied, of the arbitration agreement, that will amount

    to misconduct … in particular, it would be misconduct to act in a way which is, or

    appears to be, unfair. Misconduct committed in good faith is sometimes referred to as

    "technical misconduct", though all allegations of misconduct assert a breach of

    duty. It is not misconduct to make an erroneous finding of law or fact.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Further down in the same

paragraph <i>Halsbury’s </i>gives some instances where misconduct has been found to

occur. These include, where, by his award the arbitrator purports to decide matters which

have not in fact been included in the agreement of reference and where he has acted

unfairly and in breach of the rules of natural justice. <i>Halsbury’s Laws of

Singapore,</i> vol 2 at paragraph 20.127 comments that the term ‘misconduct’ has

been given a wide meaning and any mishandling of the arbitration, which may lead to some

substantial miscarriage of justice may be misconduct. No actual bias or partiality need be

shown as long as the court is satisfied from the conduct of the arbitrator, either by his

words, his action or inaction or his handling of the proceedings, that he displayed a real

likelihood that he might not be able to act judicially.</font></p>

        The leading authority on this issue is the case

of <i>Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd v C Miskin &amp; Son Ltd</i> 15 BLR 82. Dealing

with the facts of the case, Lord Denning MR stated (at p 95):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘I would not suggest –

    no one has suggested – that the arbitrator misconducted "himself". But what

    is said is that he misconducted the "proceedings". It is as plain as it can be

    that he misconducted the proceedings. He decided a case against the party without having

    heard the submissions in the case. He made a formal award against Modern Engineering

    without having heard counsel on their behalf. That is clearly a breach of natural

    justice.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">His Lordship then went on at p 96

to deal with the proper test which is to be applied in cases like this. He said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘This does seem to me a most

    serious matter. The judge put this test to himself in his judgment: Are the circumstances

    such as to demonstrate that the arbitrator is not a fit and proper person to continue to

    conduct the arbitration proceedings? I do not think that was the right test. I would ask

    whether his conduct was such as to destroy the confidence of the parties, or either of

    them, in his ability to come to a fair and just conclusion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The question is whether the way

    he conducted himself in the case was such that the parties can no longer have confidence

    in him. It seems to me that if this arbitrator is allowed to continue with this

    arbitration one at least of the parties will have no confidence in him. He would feel that

    the issue has been prejudged against him. It is most undesirable that either party should

    go away from a judge or an arbitrator saying, "I have not had a fair

    hearing".’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.

        Later authorities accepted the test in <i>Modern

Engineering</i> and construed it as being an objective one. In <i>The Elissar</i> [1984] 2 LLR 84 the appropriate test was said to be: Do there exist grounds from which a reasonable

person would think that there was a real likelihood that the arbitrator could not, or

would not, fairly determine the relevant issue on the basis of the evidence and arguments

to be adduced before him (per Ackner LJ at p 89).</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The allegations of misconduct</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.

        In their written submissions, the contractors

made four allegations of misconduct on the part of the arbitrator. When oral argument took

place, however, their counsel agreed that the real issue was whether they could

substantiate the first allegation of misconduct. I will, therefore, deal only with that

allegation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.

        The allegation of misconduct which I have to

decide is whether there was a breach of natural justice. This allegation comes in two

parts. It is alleged that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) the arbitrator had

    effectively ruled against the contractors on the merits of their application for an

    interim award without affording the contractors an opportunity to be heard on the merits

    and without the assistance of submissions and of any evidence by way of affidavits or

    otherwise; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) the arbitrator had prejudged

    the matter by ruling that the matter was not fit for summary disposal when the only matter

    to be determined was whether to hear the contractors’ application in the first place.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37.

        In deciding this issue, I must start on the

basis that the arbitrator knew that the sole purpose of the hearing of 4 January 2002 was

to consider whether the developers’ preliminary objections to the contractors’

application for an interim award were well founded. The correspondence between the

arbitrator and the respective parties specified that this was the purpose of the hearing

and that the merits of the contractors’ application would not be considered on 4

January.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.

        The contractors submitted that contrary to his

declared intention to hear the employers’ objections before deciding whether to hear

the contractors’ application, which he would fix on another day, the arbitrator on 8

January 2002 decided not to hear the contractors’ application on grounds that went to

the merits of the application rather than on the basis of the preliminary objections

raised by the employers. They submitted that the arbitrator did this by ruling on the

following premises:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) that in order to succeed in

    the intended application, the contractors would have to challenge the validity of the

    Delay Certificate dated 21 October 1996;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) that the validity of that

    Delay Certificate was one of the main issues in the arbitration;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) that to determine the

    validity of that Delay Certificate, he would have to hear evidence of all the facts and

    circumstances leading to its issue;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(4) that as such, the ruling he

    would have to make would necessarily be final and not interim in nature; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(5) that an interim award on the

    validity of that Delay Certificate must in fact be the final award.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In effect, they submitted, the

arbitrator made a ruling on the merits of the interim award application by prejudging the

issues and not affording the contractors the right to be heard on any of the premises set

out above. None of these issues, they said, were ever put by the arbitrator to the parties

at the 4<sup> </sup>January hearing and were only made apparent when the arbitrator

delivered his decision four days later.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.

        The employers strongly contested that

assertion. Mr Wong submitted that that the proper issue was canvassed before the

arbitrator. He agreed that in his firm’s correspondence only two issues had been

stated as the basis of the developers’ preliminary objections ie <i>res judicata/</i>issue

estoppel and collateral attack. When it came to the hearing, however, his written

submissions had detailed three issues. The third of these issues, the one that had not

been contained in his letters, was whether the matter was an appropriate one for summary

disposal and it was on this issue that the arbitrator decided the application. Mr Wong

then went through the submissions he had made before the arbitrator and pointed out

several paragraphs where arguments had been made about it being not appropriate to decide

the issues in a summary way and where it had been made clear to the arbitrator that there

were disputes of fact which could not be decided in summary proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40.

        Mr Wong agreed that the contractors had not had

an opportunity to be heard on the full merits of the application. He asserted, however,

that the arbitrator had not come to a decision on the full merits of the application. His

decision had been on whether this was a suitable case for an interim application and, on

that issue, the contractors had been heard. Mr Menon had submitted on whether it was

appropriate at the hearing for the interim award to go into the issue of the validity or

otherwise of the Original Delay Certificate. Mr Menon had put in his submissions on

suitability in that he had cited and dealt with the cases of <i>Tropicon Contractors Pte

Ltd v Lojan Properties Pte Ltd</i> [1989] SLR 610 and <i>Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v

Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6243&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 2 SLR 233</a> which were cases which had not been referred

to at all in Mr Wong’s written submissions. Mr Menon’s submission did not in any

way deal with the validity of the Original Delay Certificate and why, on the facts, the

contractors considered that certificate to be invalid. That was an argument left for the

hearing on the merits.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41.

        Mr Wong also stated that when he had completed

his submissions before the arbitrator, Mr Menon had gone ahead with his reply as contained

in the written submissions given to the arbitrator. Mr Menon had not stated that the

arguments raised by the developers were a surprise and that he needed to stand the matter

down in order to deal with them. Instead, it was submitted, Mr Menon had dealt with Mr

Wong’s arguments in substance in his oral reply.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42.

        Having examined the written submissions which

Mr Menon placed before the arbitrator and his letter of 7 January detailing his oral

response to the arguments of Mr Wong, it is apparent that at the start of the hearing, the

focus of the contractors was the preliminary objections raised by the employers. They did

not go to the hearing of 4 January with the intention of dealing with the merits of their

application and their submissions were tailored to dealing with the assertions of <i>res

judicata </i>and collateral attack. The written submissions contain no reference to the

merits of the application nor to the suitability of dealing in a summary application with

the issues that it would be necessary to deal with in a hearing on merits. As for Mr

Menon’s oral reply to the suitability arguments introduced for the first time at the

hearing by the employers, both the affidavit of Ms Elly Tham and the letter of 7 January

show that, insofar as Mr Menon raised the <i>Tropicon </i>and <i>Lian Soon </i>cases in

his reply to Mr Wong’s submissions, they were brought forward for the purpose of

showing that the arbitrator had a duty to scrutinise any attempt to deny payment due to

the contractors under a valid payment certificate. These cases were not raised in the

course of any detailed argument on the merits. Ms Tham agreed in her affidavit that the

purpose of citing the two cases was to show that the arbitrator had a duty to hear the

contractors’ application for an interim award. It is clear that the aim of the

contractors throughout was to overcome the hurdle of the preliminary objections so that

the merits of their application could be heard on another day.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43.

        One of the points that Mr Wong put before me

quite strongly, as can be seen from the foregoing paragraphs, is that Mr Menon did not

object to the objection raised at the preliminary objections hearing that the matter was

not one that was suitable for summary disposal. It appears from the evidence before me,

however, that Mr Menon did raise such objections. In an affidavit filed in support of the

contractors’ application by one Mr Tan Hwa Peng, it was stated that during the

hearing, in relation to the new submission that the matter was not suitable for summary

disposal, Mr Menon responded by reminding the arbitrator that the purpose of the hearing

was not to consider the merits of the application but whether the application ought to be

heard in the first place. This point was repeated in the 7<sup>th</sup> January letter

sent to the arbitrator before he delivered his decision.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44.

        It is plain from the arbitrator’s letter

of 8 January 2002 that his decision not to hear the application for an interim award was

based on his determination that such an application would involve ascertaining the

validity of the Original Delay Certificate and that to do this he would have to hear

evidence of all the facts and circumstances leading to its issue and would then make a

final rather than an interim award. He was greatly concerned with the issue of the

validity of that certificate and, without any submissions having been made to him on the

point, concluded that a decision on that point would determine the whole arbitration. The

arbitrator’s decision not to hear the interim application thus did not relate in any

way to the preliminary objections canvassed by the employers through their

solicitors’ letters in October 2001. The arbitrator had himself decided before 4

January 2002 that all he was going to rule on was whether on these arguments, the interim

application ought to be heard in the first place. As a result, the contractors prepared

submissions relating to these issues only. Naturally therefore, at the hearing, although

the employers’ arguments went beyond the agreed bases for the hearing, the

contractors expressly refrained from addressing their argument on the suitability of the

application for summary disposal as to do so would entail going into the merits. (By way

of an aside, I note that the contractors repeatedly referred to not wanting to do anything

that would constitute ‘an incursion into the merits’ and do wonder what sort of

violent attack they were restraining themselves from launching.) Notwithstanding the

contractors’ clearly stated position, the arbitrator, without indicating in any way

that he required full arguments on the merits or that he was contemplating deciding the

preliminary objection hearing on the basis of the issue of suitability, proceeded to make

a decision on the said basis. In my opinion, in so doing, the arbitrator misconducted the

arbitration in that he came to a decision on a point without giving the contractors the

opportunity of putting forward submissions and evidence on that point.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45.

        I agree with the submission made that the

arbitrator acted inappropriately by:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) going beyond his agreed

    reference for the hearing on 4 January even though the boundaries of that reference had

    been stipulated by him; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) by failing to clearly

    indicate during the course of the hearing and after listening to the new submission by the

    employers (and one that lay outside the original boundaries prescribed) that he was

    considering making a decision on the basis of that submission and consequently, by failing

    to call on the contractors to put forward their answers to that submission for his

    consideration; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) by failing to afford the

    parties an opportunity to address him on the facts of the case so that he could consider

    them in determining whether the issues could be dealt with summarily.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the circumstances, I rule that

there was a breach of natural justice in this case in the terms submitted by the

contractors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46.

        The next question is whether the arbitrator

should be removed. As the cases make clear, the court is reluctant to remove an arbitrator

because of the expense and delay that will be an inevitable consequence of such a removal.

Thus, this action will not be taken unless it is determined that the conduct of the

arbitrator was such as to make a reasonable person think that there was a real likelihood

that the arbitrator could not or would not fairly determine the relevant issues in the

arbitration. In this case, the contractors say that their confidence in the arbitrator has

been destroyed not only because he decided a reference on points that were not before him

but also because when they asked the arbitrator to reconsider his decision bearing in mind

all the circumstances of the hearing, he had refused to do so.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47.

        Having considered the circumstances of the

case, I have, reluctantly, concluded that the arbitrator must be removed as it appears

that there is a real likelihood of him not being able to fairly determine the issues in

the arbitration. The basic duty of an arbitrator, or any adjudicator for that matter, is

to listen to both sides of the argument and give each side an opportunity to submit on all

relevant points. In this case, the arbitrator cut short the process by telescoping the two

separate parts of the interim application hearing into one and by determining the outcome

of the first part of the application on the basis of issues that actually fell within the

second part of the application without hearing full arguments on those issues from both

sides. His breach of the basic duty cannot but give reason for doubting whether there can

be a fair adjudication of the issues in this arbitration which remain outstanding.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Conclusion</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48.

        There will be an order in terms of the motion.

The contactors’ costs shall be paid by the employers, as taxed or agreed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49.

        There is one more thing that I must say. I

found the conduct of the contractors and their solicitors in the aftermath of the

arbitrator’s decision of January 8 to be deeply disturbing. Whilst I can appreciate

that they were upset to be shut out of having their application for an interim award heard

on grounds they had not been given an opportunity to deal with, that did not justify their

subsequent actions. One letter to the arbitrator asking him to reconsider was the polite

and prudent course to take. Once he indicated that he was not inclined to do so that

should have been the end of the correspondence with him. Instead several more letters were

written and attached to one of them was the Queen’s Counsel’s opinion concluding

that the arbitrator had misconducted himself. In this letter the solicitors for the

contractors invited the arbitrator, for the second time, to discharge himself from his

position. In my view, the correct course for the contractors to have adopted once the

arbitrator had made his position clear, if they no longer wished him to conduct the

arbitration, was to take out this application forthwith. They should not have harangued

him or sought to influence his decision by blandishing counsel’s opinion in his face.

Their conduct leaves a strong impression of bullying and the arbitrator’s dignified

and restrained response in the face of such tactics can only be commended.</font></p>
