I address this below as a preliminary issue (at [36]–[50]). In essence, what has become of this issue is that the plaintiff has decided not to pursue breaches of ORC 1463 as part of the present proceedings (without forbearing to bring future proceedings pertaining to the same).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Given the circumstances, I do not intend to comment further on the wording of ORC 1463, save to note that the reference in ORC 1463 to “Company Petition in the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) in Mumbai, India, which was served on the Plaintiff on 3 March 2021” refers to the same petition as “Company Petition No. 92 of 2021” in Order 1(a) of ORC 6040. The latter simply reflects the petition number that was later assigned to those proceedings: see OS 242 Judgment at [13].

The defendant’s petition was subsequently assigned the case number Company Petition No 92 of 2021 (“the NCLT Petition”) (see OS 242 Judgment at [13]–[14]). The respondents to this petition are the same persons named in Order 1(b) of ORC 6040: the plaintiff, Ms Shobitha Annie Mani (“Ms Mani”), Mr Navin Mittal, Mr Anand Mittal and People Interactive (India) Pte Ltd (“People Interactive”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The genesis of the NCLT proceedings has been set out more fully in the OS 242 Judgment at [9]–[13]. In essence, the dispute principally relates to two matters: the management of People Interactive (where the plaintiff and defendant are shareholders), and the rights and obligations of shareholders under a Shareholders’ Agreement (or “SHA”). The defendant seeks the following reliefs in the NCLT proceedings:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) an injunction to restrain the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s directors, employees, servants, agents and or any person claiming through or under them, from in any manner, disrupting the management and operation of People Interactive and/or conducting the affairs of People Interactive in a manner prejudicial or oppressive to any member of People Interactive or People Interactive; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) a declaration that the defendant’s continuation as an executive director of People Interactive, pursuant to the resolution passed by the board of directors of People Interactive at the meeting held on 28 November 2019 is valid and that all actions taken by the defendant as an executive director of People Interactive shall not be invalid; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) an injunction to restrain the plaintiff, People Interactive and certain others, their directors, employees, servants, agents and/or any person claiming through or under them, from in any manner, whether directly or indirectly hindering and/or prohibiting the defendant from performing his functions as an executive director of People Interactive;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) an order to direct the plaintiff, People Interactive and certain others to initiate a process for identifying and appointing a suitable, independent, non-partisan and impartial candidate in the capacity as managing director of People Interactive in a time-bound manner; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) certain other declarations and interim reliefs.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In the OS 242 Judgment, I held (at [66]–[68]) that all disputes between the parties brought before the NCLT fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement contained in the SHA. I further found that the circumstances militated in favour of granting a permanent ASI, and granted the ASI accordingly (at [69]–[93]). Relevantly, Order 1(a) of ORC 6040 is worded to restrain the defendant from pursuing, continuing and/or proceeding with the action commenced by him by way of the NCLT Petition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At the time I heard parties in relation to the ASI application, the NCLT Petition had not been withdrawn. Instead, the defendant has repeatedly sought adjournments of the hearing of the NCLT Petition. Even after ORC 6040 was granted on 26 October 2021, the defendant sought at least two further adjournments, on 11 November 2021 and 19 January 2022.

In what was acknowledged by Vinodh Coomaraswamy J to be “very unusual circumstances” (at [65]), the court in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate </span>decided to proceed to hear and determine seven charges against each of the two respondents, although not all were contained in the statement of committal in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Given that the plaintiff’s ultimate position was not to seek an amendment to include ORC 1463 in these proceedings, strictly speaking, I did not have to decide on the applicability or effect of <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span>. However, assuming this were necessary, I would have formed the view that the present case is distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The court in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span> had expressly based its decision on three distinctive features of the case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court considered that none of the charges would have taken either respondent by surprise. These charges had been referenced or addressed in four ways: (i) the charges were advanced in the plaintiff’s written submissions; (ii) the court put the respondents on notice that all charges were being pursued; (iii) the respondents then addressed the court on all charges; and (iv) the respondents agreed that the court may consider all charges against them (at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court did not consider itself lacking in any factual material relevant to either respondent’s defence. The respondents had been cross-examined on their affidavits, with the plaintiff’s case on all charges put to them. Any prejudice was limited to a missed opportunity to adduce one item of evidence – this being evidence which would have been relevant only to mitigation and irrelevant to the issue of liability anyway (at [60]–[62]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the court observed that even if the charges were dismissed on a purely procedural basis, the plaintiff could have immediately applied afresh for leave to commence committal proceedings, while relying on new statements of committal. It would have been contrary to the respondents’ interests and the interests of justice to compel the plaintiff to pursue this course given that the existing proceedings were already protracted (at [63]–[64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Returning to the present case, it is plain that neither the first nor second reasons in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span> applies to the present facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In relation to the first reason (at [45(a)]), the court in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span> identified <span class="font-italic">four</span> cumulative procedural features for finding that there was no surprise: the inclusion of the charges in the plaintiff’s written submissions, the notice from the court, the response from the respondents, and the agreement of the respondents. In the present case, there was no reference in the written submissions, no notice from the court, and no agreement between the parties, to say the least. As to the defendant’s response at the oral hearing, Mr Nandakumar’s response was focused on the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">inability</span> to respond meaningfully and adduce evidence that would address the alleged breaches of ORC 1463. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The second reason (at [45(b)]) also does not apply. As Mr Nandakumar submitted, had it been alleged that the seeking of adjournments before the Bombay High Court amounted to breaches of ORC 1463, the defendant would have prepared and given evidence of what had transpired in each of the eight or so hearings in Bombay between March to November 2021, to demonstrate that the plaintiff had effectively waived any breaches.

This is for good sense: the third reason would readily apply in many committal applications. Applicants would almost always be able to file fresh committal proceedings. Applicants would almost always expend some amount of time and cost in pursuing their (abortive) committal applications. Accepting such a readily available reason risks making recourse to O 52 r 5(3) too easy and frequent, and would unduly undermine the central role played by the Statement of Committal, as articulated in <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span>”) at [61]–[62] (see below at [129]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Therefore, had it been necessary for me to reach a view on <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span> and O 52 r 5(3), I would have found that <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span> supplies insufficient reason for me to grant the plaintiff leave under O 52 r 5(3) in the present case, which stands on a different factual footing.

The second stage involves the actual application for an order of committal against the respondent.

At least on its face, it requires the defendant <span class="font-italic">not</span> <span class="font-italic">to do</span> something (here, to proceed, pursue or continue with the NCLT proceedings) as opposed to requiring him to positively <span class="font-italic">do</span> something (such as withdrawing a petition or filing a notice of discontinuance).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 This distinction between prohibitory and mandatory ASIs also appears to find support in some cases where the courts have expressly included mandatory language in addition to prohibitory language.

As observed in Thomas Raphael QC, <span class="font-italic">The Anti-suit Injunction</span> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">The Anti-suit Injunction</span>”) at paras 3.38–3.39:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The standard form of anti-suit injunction[s] is prohibitory, restraining the injunction defendant from taking any further steps to pursue the foreign proceedings. However, this may not be enough to ensure that the injunction is practically effective. The foreign action may have a life of its own. Consequently, in appropriate cases the court will also grant a mandatory anti-suit injunction requiring the injunction defendant to obtain the equivalent of a stay of the foreign proceedings or even to discontinue them. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">A mandatory anti-suit injunction can be seen as a more invasive form of relief, and there are a number of cases suggesting that a stronger case, and particular reasons, is required to justify it. …</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The cases referenced by <span class="font-italic">The Anti-suit Injunction</span> include <span class="font-italic">Ecom Agroindustrial Corp Ltd v Mosharaf Composite Textile Mill Ltd</span> [2013] EWHC 1276 (Comm), where it was observed at [37] that “a court should be more cautious before ordering a mandatory injunction”; and <span class="font-italic">Evergreen Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Fast Shipping &amp; Transportation Co Ltd</span> [2014] EWHC 4893 (QB), where the court noted at [19] that “it is only right to grant mandatory relief exceptionally and if the court is satisfied that a prohibitory injunction would not be an adequate remedy”. These observations notwithstanding, however, I note that a mandatory injunction was readily granted in both cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 On the other hand, there appears to be a growing view that, in appropriate circumstances, drawing technical distinctions between prohibitory and mandatory language <span class="font-italic">in ASIs</span> might amount to needless formalism. As <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Anti-suit Injunction</span> explains at para 3.39 (after making the observations described at [66] above), mandatory language might simply “be no more than the spelling out of the inevitable consequence of a prohibitory injunction”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There are signs, however, that the courts are moving to a more sophisticated view. It can be artificial to treat the dividing line between mandatory and prohibitory relief in any rigid fashion. <span class="font-italic">A so-called mandatory injunction requiring discontinuance may in truth be no more than the spelling out of the inevitable consequence of a prohibitory injunction preventing continuance of the foreign action</span>. Further, stopping the foreign action may be a cleaner and clearer result than prohibiting it from being pursued and may require less policing. So, it may be that the mere fact that an injunction could be regarded as mandatory should not automatically trigger any different and more demanding regime: the focus should be on whether, in truth, the mandatory relief is more invasive in a way that should demand higher scrutiny. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 A similar view was expressed in <span class="font-italic">Mobile Telecommunications</span>. In relation to the mandatory ASI granted (see [65] above), the court stated (at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I say that <span class="font-italic">that specific provision, mandatory in form, in truth does no more than express in words what ordinarily is required and, indeed, is expected and assumed to occur when final injunctive relief is granted preventing a defendant from prosecuting, pursuing or otherwise further continuing proceedings </span>that have been brought in breach of contract or otherwise vexatiously or oppressively, and is plainly appropriate in circumstances where that relief has now been granted on a final basis and on the evidence of the events of the last few weeks it is apparent that it is necessary for the defendant to take an active step in order to prevent the Saudi proceedings from going any further. So in my judgment, it is entirely correct to express that in terms in a specific mandatory form of order in the injunction to be granted today. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my view, these comments provide a compelling answer to the suggestion above at [63]–[66] that courts only intend for an ASI to have mandatory consequences when these are expressly stated. Rather, such language is often included prophylactically for good measure – as a way of making explicit or reinforcing what is “expected and assumed to occur” in the “standard form” prohibitory ASI; in other words, a “belt and braces” approach. The fact that mandatory language is sometimes used should not be interpreted to mean that purely prohibitory directions – which after all form the majority of ASIs granted – can never achieve mandatory effects, or that mandatory language should be used to “read down” the import of prohibitory language. Such an extreme interpretation rests on an unstated and unsubstantiated assumption – that some form of clinical, bright line separation necessarily exists between mandatory and prohibitory directions in an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The artificiality of such a clinical separation becomes apparent once one considers how ASIs operate in reality. A party directed to not continue an action would, in the ordinary course of things, feel compelled to file a notice of discontinuance or take some equivalent step to terminate it. This is because the initiative does not lie with the party to decide whether or when to continue an action (save perhaps where the action has been stayed). Control over the action’s progress lies with the <span class="font-italic">court</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(wherever situated), which may fix matters for hearing and in this sense <span class="font-italic">force</span> the party to take a decision on how it intends to proceed. Each time this occurs, the party is placed at risk of breaching the ASI for as long as those proceedings remain alive; the safer and often more obvious option would simply be to bring the foreign proceedings to an end once and for all. In practice, therefore, a prohibition on continuing proceedings, and a decision to discontinue proceedings, are almost always two sides of the same coin. It is with this practical context in mind that ASIs are drafted and granted. It bears reiterating that the majority of ASIs contain purely prohibitory language. It seems most unlikely that the courts ordering these ASIs intend only a partial restraint on foreign proceedings, or that they would be content with litigants merely keeping foreign proceedings in abeyance, while leaving open the option of continuing with those proceedings whenever they choose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the final analysis, when interpreting ASIs, one must not lose sight of their essential nature and purpose or be blinkered by form over substance. A court granting an ASI is, in effect, directing a party not to frustrate litigation or arbitration proceedings by pursuing parallel proceedings abroad, whether such proceedings are brought in breach of the parties’ agreement on dispute resolution or otherwise in a manner that the court considers to be unconscionable. Whether an injunctee’s conduct complies with an ASI therefore must be assessed having due regard to this purpose. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Aurol Anthony Sabastian v Sembcorp Marine Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 246 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp (CA)</span>”) at [99]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In proceedings for criminal contempt, the court will not adopt a myopic and blinkered view of the scope of an order. It is ultimately the <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> for which the order was granted that will be the lodestar in guiding the court’s determination as to the true <span class="font-italic">effect</span> of the order. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal interpreted an interim sealing order which prevented the <span class="font-italic">inspection</span> of sealed documents by a non-party as also proscribing the <span class="font-italic">disclosure</span> of said documents by a party. As the court reasoned at [101]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This is the same distinction we have already alluded to at [29] above. <span class="font-italic">While in a narrow sense</span>, the effect of granting the interim sealing order was that it prevented an individual from inspecting the sealed documents, <span class="font-italic">it was evident that the AR had intended that the public should not have access to the confidential information contained in the sealed documents through any other means</span>. To find otherwise would mean that a party to the proceedings who might routinely have obtained copies of the sealed materials as well as a non-party who somehow obtained possession of them could, with impunity, have disclosed the confidential information to the public in spite of the interim sealing order. <span class="font-italic">This would not only denude the </span><span class="font-italic">interim sealing order of all meaning and effect, but would also allow one, in the words of Lindley LJ, to ‘set the court’s process at naught’.</span> By any measure, it would be perverse if such conduct were not also caught within the ambit of the offence of criminal contempt provided each element had been satisfactorily proved. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 To be sure, these observations were made by the Court of Appeal with a different question in mind, namely<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether a<span class="font-italic"> third party</span> to the order of court was in contempt for interfering with the administration of justice. In answering this question, it is well-accepted that the relevant test examines whether the third party deliberately frustrated the order’s <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp (CA) </span>at [72]). Be that as it may, as a matter of principle, it seems inconceivable that an order’s purpose would only be relevant to third parties but not a <span class="font-italic">named</span> party. In my judgment, the principles articulated in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp (CA)</span> are no less relevant to direct injunctees. It is notable that the analysis in [99] and [101] of the case is not worded as being confined to third-party situations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 These principles had also been articulated by Quentin Loh J (as he then was) sitting in the High Court on the same matter, in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v Aurol Anthony Sabastian </span>[2013] 1 SLR 245 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp (HC)</span>”) at [40]–[41]. A number of observations made by the learned judge are worth repeating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 A court therefore has to look at the purpose of the order, to determine whether the contemnor had the requisite intention to interfere with the administration of justice and therefore whether he intended, by his act, to frustrate or thwart the purpose of the order: <span class="font-italic">A-G v Times Newspapers</span> at 223, and then to determine whether the contemnor’s act carried a real risk that the administration of justice would be interfered with. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court also has to consider whether the act or acts in question had the effect of destroying or nullifying either the purpose of trial, pursuant to which the order of court was made, or the order itself</span>:<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">A-</span><span class="font-italic">G v Times Newspapers</span> at 206H–207F. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It is clear that the purpose of the court which granted the order, and not only the purpose of the parties applying for the order, is what is relevant</span>: <span class="font-italic">A-G v Punch</span> at [39]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">… Fundamental to the concept of contempt in this context is the intentional impedance or prejudice of the purpose of the court.</span> The underlying purpose of the Attorney General, as the plaintiff in the proceedings against Mr Whayler, in seeking the order against Mr Shayler is nothing to the point. Lord Oliver of Aylmerton adverted to this distinction in <span class="font-italic">Attorney General v Times Newspapers</span> [1992] 1 AC 191, 223:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">“Purpose”, in this context, refers, o[f] course, not to the litigant’s purpose in obtaining the order or in fighting the action but to the purpose which, in seeking to administer justice between the parties in the particular litigation of which it has become seised, the court was intending to fulfil.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41 The court is not strictly confined to the express terms of the order when determining the purpose of the court in granting the order in criminal contempt proceedings. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The court is also entitled to consider the circumstances surrounding the grant of the order and its purpose</span>: see <span class="font-italic">A-G v Times Newspapers</span> at 224D–224E; <span class="font-italic">Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2005) at paras 11-43 and 12-51. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Even if I am wrong that these observations (at [67]–[74] above) are of general applicability, I nevertheless find that they make eminent sense and would certainly apply on the present facts at the very least. The defendant’s failure to discontinue the NCLT proceedings can only amount to continuing and/or proceeding with them. The adjournments here are not <span class="font-italic">sine die</span>; nor are the NCLT proceedings held in abeyance specifically until CA 64 is decided. Instead, the adjournments have been administrative and were necessitated only by the paucity of time in that the NCLT has been unable to hear the matter. It is undisputed that the matter continues to be listed in the NCLT’s hearing list. When the case finally comes up for hearing before the NCLT, the expectation is that it can and will be heard. Indeed, the only plausible explanation for the defendant’s conduct is that he <span class="font-italic">wants</span> the matter to be heard, and is keeping the proceedings alive for this very reason.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In my judgment, the defendant’s conduct in no way accords with the letter and spirit of ORC 6040 and the stated purpose for which it was granted in the OS 242 Judgment. When ORC 6040 was granted, the NCLT proceedings were already afoot. I found that this was contrary to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate in Singapore. Order 1(a) was thus granted with <span class="font-italic">specific</span> reference to the NCLT proceedings, and expressed in wide terms – “pursuing, continuing and/or proceeding with” – which phrase covers every conceivable manner of enabling the NCLT proceedings to remain afoot. In the circumstances, the defendant cannot possibly justify how his conduct was consistent with the nature and purpose of Order 1(a) of ORC 6040.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The defendant’s concerns with prejudice do not justify breaching Order 1(a)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 On the second sub-issue of prejudice, I agree with Mr Thio that the potential prejudice from withdrawing proceedings is no justification for contempt of court. An injunctee who does not wish to comply with an order or who believes an order is wrong cannot simply ignore his duty to comply – his or her recourse is in having the order discharged, set aside or stayed (<span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 60 at [28]–[29]; <span class="font-italic">Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 518 (“<span class="font-italic">Pertamina</span>”) at [81]–[82]). The defendant’s proper recourse was to seek a stay pending his appeal in CA 64, or as Mr Thio submitted, to seek a carve-out from the ASI to enable him to seek adjournments of the NCLT proceedings. Neither course was pursued by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The defendant has also failed to particularise the prejudice he expects to suffer. As the plaintiff submitted at the oral hearing, while there may be cost considerations to withdrawing the NCLT proceedings and starting again, such prejudice is not irreparable as the possibility of instituting fresh NCLT proceedings is not (on the available evidence) foreclosed.

Order 1(b) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is ordered that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.  An injunction is granted restraining the defendant, whether by himself, his agents or otherwise, from:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  commencing or procuring the commencement of <span class="font-italic">any legal proceedings in respect of any dispute, controversy, claim or disagreement of any kind in connection with or relating to the management of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">People Interactive</span><span class="font-italic">”</span><span class="font-italic">), or in connection with or relating to any of the matters set out in the Shareholders' Agreement</span> dated 10 February 2006, as amended from time to time (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">SHA</span>”) in any other dispute resolution forum other than an arbitration tribunal constituted in accordance with the rules laid down by the International Chamber of Commerce (“<span class="font-weight-bold">ICC</span>”) and seated in Singapore, against the plaintiff, and/or Shobitha Annie Mani and/or Navin Mittal and/or Anand Mittal and/or People Interactive and/or any person in relation to any dispute relating to the management of People Interactive, or arising from, connected with or relating to any of the matters set out in the SHA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Parties’ submissions clashed over two sub-issues:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether any of the defendant’s steps in the proceedings before the Bombay High Court amounted to “commencing … any legal proceedings”; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) if so, whether the proceedings commenced were “in respect of any dispute, controversy, claim or disagreement of any kind in connection with or relating to the management of People Interactive … or in connection with or relating to any of the matters set out in the [SHA]”.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 It is plain that if both questions are answered in the affirmative, the remainder of the requirements under Order 1(b) would also be satisfied. Proceedings in the Bombay High Court are proceedings “in any other dispute resolution forum other than an arbitral tribunal” of the relevant description.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the defendant commenced proceedings subsequent to the grant of the permanent ASI on 26 October 2021</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 There are two key dates on which steps were taken by the defendant in the Bombay High Court proceedings:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 18 March 2021 – Suit 95 and IA 1010 (application for interim reliefs) were filed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 15 November 2021 – IA 2827 (application to amend Suit 95 and for the EGM Injunction) was filed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Suit 95 and IA 1010 (filed on 18 March 2021)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As noted at [7], the plaintiff has chosen to rest its application for committal solely on breaches of the permanent ASI granted in ORC 6040, and is not pursuing breaches of the interim ASI granted in ORC 1463 in these proceedings. ORC 6040 was made on 26 October 2021 and served on the defendant on 1 November 2021. The plaintiff does not argue that ORC 6040 has retrospective effect, whether by relating back to the date of ORC 1463 or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Consequently, the defendant says that Suit 95 and IA 1010, which were filed (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, commenced) <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to 26 October 2021, cannot seriously be regarded as having been commenced in breach of Order 1(b) of ORC 6040.

</div> The defendant was, Mr Thio contended, effectively sliding into a linguistic gap in the Order to launch a collateral attack.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In my view, there is some rhetorical force to Mr Thio’s argument. At the same time, however, it is not without difficulty:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Textually, Order 1(b) only refers to the commencement of proceedings. It does not use words such as “pursuing”, “continuing” or “proceeding with”, even though these same words were used in Order 1(a).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The statement that “one cannot be permitted to continue something that one could not start” has as a logical predicate that Suit 95 could not be lawfully started. There is therefore some circularity to this logic (at least in so far as ORC 1463 is not in the picture) – the plaintiff must still show why Suit 95 could not be started.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Procedurally, by the time OS 242 was heard on 29 April 2021, Suit 95 had already been commenced. Therefore, the plaintiff had the opportunity to apply to amend the OS to seek broader language for Order 1(b), rather than keeping to the original wording in terms of “commencement”. While it is perhaps arguable whether the plaintiff ought to have done so, the fact that it did not remains a relevant consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Nevertheless, in the final analysis and notwithstanding these difficulties, I find that I need not reach a conclusion on this issue. This is in light of my next finding: that the commencement of<span class="font-italic"> IA 2827</span> fell within the temporal scope of ORC 6040.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) IA 2827 (filed on 15 November 2021)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 IA 2827 does not raise the same temporal issues, because it was filed after ORC 6040 was made.

</div> On the other hand, the defendant has not submitted <span class="font-italic">why</span> Indian law ought to apply to this question. To my mind, it is material that ORC 6040 is an order of this court as the court in the arbitral seat. The ASI in the OS 242 Judgment was granted on the basis of the court’s conclusion that Singapore law as the <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span> governs the issue of arbitrability at the pre-award stage. These committal proceedings fundamentally engage the interpretation and application of ORC 6040 in the context of <span class="font-italic">enforcing</span> the defendant’s compliance with that very ASI. The <span class="font-italic">grant</span> of an ASI like ORC 6040 is itself governed by the law of the granting court, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore law (<span class="font-italic">The Anti-suit Injunction </span>at paras 4.08–4.10). To my mind, Singapore law should also logically extend to matters such as the precise content and wording of the ASI for purposes of its enforcement in this court. Thus, even if any choice of law issue is involved, the relevant choice in this case would, in my view, be Singapore law as the <span class="font-italic">lex arbitri</span> and not Indian law as (for example) the law governing the SHA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In any event, even if Indian law were to apply to this question, the defendant’s expert evidence does not address the actual issue at hand. With respect, the defendant’s expert report only concludes that the commencement of IA 2827 would not amount to the commencement of “further or fresh” proceedings.

</div> This appears to address the <span class="font-italic">substantive conditions</span> under which interim relief may be granted; it says nothing about whether IA 2827 would <span class="font-italic">procedurally </span>stand apart as a separate proceeding capable of being commenced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 This impression is reinforced once one carefully studies the paragraph in <span class="font-italic">State of Orissa </span>that the excerpt is taken from and examines the issue the court was confronted with (at 34–35):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On behalf of the appellant it was urged that the Court had no jurisdiction to pass such orders under Article 226 [of the Constitution of India] under the circumstances of the case. This is not a case where the Court before finally disposing of a petition under Article 226 gave directions in the nature of interim relief for the purpose of maintaining the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The question which we have to determine is whether directions in the nature of interim relief only could be granted under </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Article 226, when the Court expressly stated that it refrained from determining the rights of the parties on which a writ of mandamus or directions of a like nature could be issued</span>. In our opinion, Article 226 cannot be used for the purpose of giving interim relief as the only and final relief on the application as the High Court has purported to do. The directions have been given here only to circumvent the provisions of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code, and in our opinion that is not within the scope of Article 226. An interim relief can be granted only in aid of and as ancillary to the main relief which may be available to the party on final determination of his rights in a suit or proceeding. If the Court was of the opinion that there was no other convenient or adequate remedy open to the petitioners, it might have proceeded to investigate the case on its merits and come to a decision as to whether the petitioners succeeded in establishing that there was an infringement of any of their legal rights which entitled them to a writ of mandamus or any other directions of a like nature; and pending such determination it might have made a suitable interim order for maintaining the <span class="font-italic">status quo ante</span>. But when the Court declined to decide on the rights of the parties and expressly held that they should be investigated more properly in a civil suit, it could not, for the purpose of facilitating the institution of such suit, issue directions in the nature of temporary injunctions, under Article 226 of the Constitution. In our opinion, the language of Article 226 does not permit such an action. On that short ground the judgment of the Orissa High Court under appeal cannot be upheld. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is evident that the court in <span class="font-italic">State of Orissa</span> was not at all concerned with the question of when “proceedings” (much less “any legal proceedings”) may be said to be “commenced”. As such, the case does not provide a clear basis for the defendant’s expert’s opinion that the commencement of IA 2827 would not amount to the commencement of “further or fresh” proceedings. Even if one accepts the case of <span class="font-italic">State of Orissa </span>to be of some relevance, the defendant’s expert report remains silent on the <span class="font-italic">analytical process</span> by which one goes from the case to the eventual opinion expressed. For these reasons, I find the defendant’s expert opinion to be of little assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I return to examine IA 2827 through the lens of Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I first note that there is no overriding statutory definition that binds or informs what “commenc[ing] … any legal proceeding” means in Singapore. This may be contrasted with Malaysia’s Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (M’sia), for instance, where s 3 of the same defines “proceeding” to mean “any proceeding whatsoever of a civil or criminal nature and includes an application at any stage of a proceeding”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The only Singapore authority cited by the parties is the case of <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Tee Kok Boon</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 412 (“<span class="font-italic">Tee</span>”).

There is no fixed and unalterable meaning to be attached to the phrase “institute proceedings”. The often-quoted comment of Martin, J.A., in <span class="font-italic">Eddy v. Stewart</span> [1932] 3 W.W.R. 71 at p. 74, about the variable meaning of the word “proceeding”, <span class="font-italic">applies with equal force to the words “institute proceedings</span>”. He said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The word “proceeding,” in its derivative sense, means, according to <span class="font-italic">Murray’s English Dictionary</span>, vol. 7, at p. 1407, “<span class="font-italic">the action of going onward; advance, onward movement or course</span>.” In its legal sense, it includes the form in which actions are brought and defended; the manner of intervening in suits and of conducting them; <span class="font-italic">it is sometimes used as equivalent to and interchangeable with the word “action,” and it is also applied to any step in an action.</span> From the authorities it is clear that the word may be differently construed in different Acts: <span class="font-italic">Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary</span>, vol. 3, pp. 1561 <span class="font-italic">et seq</span>.; <span class="font-italic">Ratteau v.

The statute is intended to cover a variety of proceedings and until very recently there was no suggestion that it did not. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These were observations made by Blair JA in the Ontario Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Foy v Foy (No 2) </span>(1979) 26 OR (2d) 220 (“<span class="font-italic">Foy</span>”), a case concerning the interpretation of the phrase “instituted vexatious legal proceedings” in s 1(1) of the Vexatious Proceedings Act, RSO 1970, c 481 (Can) (“VPA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 <span class="font-italic">Tee </span>itself concerned the interpretation of an order of court sought pursuant to s 74(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCJA 1999”). Section 74(1) of the SCJA 1999 empowered the court to order, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that “no legal proceedings shall without the leave of the High Court be instituted by [a person] in any court” where that person “has habitually and persistently and without any reasonable ground instituted vexatious legal proceedings”. One of the interpretive questions the court was faced with was whether s 74(1) applied to interlocutory proceedings. Adopting a purposive interpretation, namely that s 74(1) was meant to prevent abuses of the court’s process through vexatious litigation, the court held that it did (at [99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 While the court in <span class="font-italic">Tee</span> did not directly attribute its decision to Blair JA’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Foy</span>, this does not prevent me from placing reliance on those observations. In these proceedings, I am not concerned with the interpretation of s 74(1) of the SCJA 1999 <span class="font-italic">per se</span>; I am instead concerned with the broader question of whether a litigant should be allowed to commence proceedings when these may be vexatious. In <span class="font-italic">Foy</span> and <span class="font-italic">Tee</span>, this took the form of a statutory restraint on a vexatious litigant; in the present proceedings, this concerns the defendant’s pursuit of foreign proceedings in defiance of an ASI and the underlying arbitration agreement – a breach which I found to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> vexatious and oppressive at [88] of the OS 242 Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I find Blair JA’s comments to persuasive. They are, in my judgment, relevant and may also be applied to the interpretation of ORC 6040. Blair JA made two main points:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, as a linguistic matter, the word “proceeding” is wide enough to encompass “any step taken in an action”. As the learned Justice explained, a proceeding can be “undertaken” not only by way of a writ or appeal, but also through the “making of an application” or “bringing of a motion” (and in Blair JA’s view, this was precisely how s 1(1) of the VPA ought to be interpreted).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, what “institut[ing] proceedings” means is in the final analysis a contextual inquiry. There is “no fixed and unalterable meaning” attached to this phrase. Likewise, what “proceeding” means “must be gathered from the context”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 On the facts, the context of ORC 6040 is clear (see [71] and [76] above) – the defendant has been restrained from taking steps inconsistent with the arbitration agreement. Moreover, read as a whole, the ASI was not confined to fresh actions that had yet to be commenced. The co-existence of Order 1(a) alongside Order 1(b) makes this clear: their <span class="font-italic">collective width</span> demonstrates the intent that all manner of proceedings were not to be advanced by the defendant. There is nothing in the language or context of ORC 6040 that detracts from this. Neither is there anything intrinsic to the word “proceedings” that confines this to originating actions as opposed to interlocutory steps within an action (as Blair JA noted, at [99] and [102] above). The breadth of the specific phrase used in ORC 6040 – “<span class="font-italic">any</span> legal proceeding” – only serves to fortify my conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I acknowledge that there <span class="font-italic">may</span> exist a penumbra of procedural steps, particularly those of a purely administrative or logistical nature, which <span class="font-italic">may</span> fall outside the ambit of “any legal proceeding” under ORC 6040. However, I am satisfied that IA 2827 is not one such case. In the papers filed in IA 2827, the defendant himself emphasised that it was “critical that the proposed amendments be carried out for [the Bombay High Court] to have the benefit of all the facts and issues in the matter before deciding on the reliefs sought in [Suit 95]”,

For instance:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732, the Court of Appeal observed at [50] that “the phrase ‘arising out of or in connection with’ that appears in the subject clause <span class="font-italic">has a wide ambit that extends to all manner of issues that have a relationship with the SPA</span>. <span class="font-italic">A generous interpretation should be given to such a phrase</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>...” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Sabah Shipyard (Pakistan) Ltd v Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 184, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) endorsed at [12] the view that “words of broad import such as ‘in connection with this contract’ are to be given their natural meaning in the context in which they are found, and are not to be cut down by reference to earlier decisions giving a narrower meaning to the same or similar expressions in other contexts”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Gulf Hibiscus Ltd v Rex International Holding Ltd and another</span> [2017] SGHC 210 at [74], Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) described the phrase “arising under, out of or relating [to]” an agreement as being “a very wide one”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 These views are consonant with Gary Born’s survey of global arbitral practice. Born observes that “[c]ourts in almost all jurisdictions have concluded that the phrase ‘relating to’ extends an arbitration clause to a broad range of disputes” and that “[t]here are virtually no contrary authorities and the term ‘relating’ should ordinarily be interpreted very expansively, as encompassing any matter, dispute, or claim having any material connection to the parties’ contract or their actions under that contract” (see ‘Chapter 9: Interpretation of International Arbitration Agreements’ in Gary B Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Kluwer, 3rd Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>”) at pp 1455–1457). Similar observations are made for the phrase “in connection with” (<span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> at pp 1457–1459).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In my judgment, these observations apply equally to an ASI granted to give effect to an arbitration agreement – as in the present case. In such circumstances, in granting an ASI, the court is simply “enforcing [the] contractual promise” made between parties: <span class="font-italic">John Reginald Stott Kirkham and </span><span class="font-italic">others v Trane US Inc and others</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 at [29]. Unless an ASI applicant seeks and obtains an ASI of a different scope, rational commercial parties are likely to expect consistency between the scope of their arbitration agreements and of the ASIs obtained to enforce those arbitration agreements. In this case, this ought, at the minimum, to mean that the meaning of the phrase “related to” in the parties’ arbitration agreement would carry over into ORC 6040.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The management of People Interactive and/or matters set out in the SHA</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Turning to the facts, it is, in my view, difficult to see how the reliefs sought in IA 2827 could be anything but connected with or related to the management of People Interactive and matters set out in the SHA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In respect of the amendments, the defendant’s own submission in IA 2827 was that these were sought to enable “the reliefs sought in [Suit 95 to] be suitably modified”.

</div> In my judgment, both points are legally irrelevant.

None of these considerations attenuates the defendant’s obligation defined in ORC 6040.

</div> Additionally, the Statement’s four corners “function as the boundaries” of the plaintiff’s case (<span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong </span>at [61]). The defendant is also right in asserting that the plaintiff cannot simply refer to its verifying affidavit (or a subsequent affidavit, for that matter) to expand on the Statement’s contents. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong</span>, while a schedule or addendum attached to the Statement may form part of it, references to other documents which do not form part of the notice “such as the affidavit filed in support of the leave application” would not; the affidavit is to verify the truth of the Statement’s contents and not supplement them (at [66]). Defects in the Statement also cannot be cured through counsel’s submissions, whether written or oral, or by apprising the alleged contemnor of the application’s grounds by other means (at [66] and [69]). Permeating all these rules is this principle: the requirement of sufficient particularity is a procedural safeguard that has to be strictly complied with – no matter whether non-compliance causes harm or prejudice to the alleged contemnor (at [69]). These safeguards are necessary and important because of the quasi-criminal nature of a committal application, even in the context of civil litigation (<span class="font-italic">Li Shengwu v Attorney-General </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1081 at [56]–[67]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 That being said, on the facts, I find that the Statement of Committal <span class="font-italic">is</span> sufficiently particularised. In particular, it alludes sufficiently to the plaintiff taking issue with the EGM Injunction sought. Let me explain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The main principle governing the interpretation of a Statement of Committal is that it must be interpreted using the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the alleged contemnor, reading the Statement in a fair and sensible manner: <span class="font-italic">Mok Kah Hong </span>at [62].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In this case, the defendant has taken the position that the Statement of Committal is completely silent on the EGM Injunction when it is not. The Statement of Committal <span class="font-italic">does </span>allege that “[t]he [d]efendant’s act of amending Suit 95 and Application No 1010, <span class="font-italic">and continued seeking of reliefs from the Bombay High Court</span>, is thus a clear contempt of Court” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div>
</div> This sentence refers to both the making of an amendment <span class="font-italic">and the continued seeking of reliefs</span>. In reading the Statement, the defendant must have appreciated that “the continued seeking of reliefs” refers to something <span class="font-italic">other than</span> the making of amendments. Having been the very party that put forward IA 2827, he cannot credibly suggest that he was ignorant of what these reliefs were. A reasonable person situated in his position certainly cannot do so. After all, this is not a case where a dozen different reliefs were sought, for example, such that a generic reference to the continued seeking of reliefs might be ambiguous on its face and leave the defendant in doubt as to the plaintiff’s precise case. All that was in play was the filing of Suit 95, the filing of IA 1010, and the filing of IA 2827 (in which only two primary reliefs were sought – the amendments and the EGM Injunction). The <span class="font-italic">continued</span> seeking of <span class="font-italic">reliefs</span> can thus only be reasonably understood as referring to the EGM Injunction. It is also incontrovertible that the phrase “continued seeking of reliefs” is linguistically wide enough to include the EGM Injunction, and there was no suggestion to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I therefore find that the alleged omission of the EGM Injunction from the Statement of Committal is not a procedural defect, because this was not omitted by the plaintiff to begin with. Even if it was omitted, this would not defeat the plaintiff’s committal application. As I have found above (chiefly at [105] and [113]), the seeking of <span class="font-italic">amendments</span> in IA 2827 itself amounts to the commencement of proceedings connected with or related to the management of People Interactive and matters set out in the SHA. Thus, this act in and of itself would have provided sufficient basis for a finding of contempt of court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other issues relating to the Bombay High Court proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In my analysis above, I have addressed the two main sub-issues (described at [81]) arising from the Bombay High Court proceedings and the defendant’s breach of Order 1(b) of ORC 6040, as well as the alleged procedural defect in the Statement of Committal.

The defendant has not shown how the plaintiff’s subjective <span class="font-italic">interpretation</span> of the scope of ORC 6040, and its views on whether the Indian proceedings fall within or without it, fit within these principles. ORC 6040 cannot be modified or re-interpreted by implied mutual consent in this way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The defendant offers a further reason for why the plaintiff’s conduct can only be understood as expressing “acceptance” that Suit 95 and IA 2827 were not proceedings covered under ORC 6040: were it otherwise, the plaintiff would be liable for aiding or abetting the alleged contempt through its failure to object.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 This argument is fallacious. It proceeds from the erroneous assumption that the plaintiff cannot by any imagination be found liable for aiding or abetting, and so the court is constrained to accept the only remaining conclusion – that the plaintiff did not object to those proceedings because the defendant was not acting in breach of ORC 6040. The flaw is that the assumption need not be true. In theory, provided the conditions for aiding or abetting are met, the plaintiff too can be held liable for the same. Hence, the very premise of the defendant’s argument is problematic.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 More charitably, the defendant’s argument could be understood to be that it is <span class="font-italic">implausible</span> that the plaintiff would have even <span class="font-italic">countenanced</span> aiding or abetting contempt – so the logical conclusion must be that it was not doing so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Again, there is a logical gap in this argument. It assumes that the plaintiff’s silence runs a real risk of amounting to aiding or abetting, such that the plaintiff would have taken deliberate steps to avoid this. But, realistically examined, there was no such risk. The touchstone for establishing third party liability for contempt is that there must be some <span class="font-italic">intention</span> to interfere with the course of justice, whether this is achieved by actively assisting the primary contemnor, or through some other form of interference (<span class="font-italic">Pertamina </span>at [49]–[50], [63]–[65]). From the record, there is no evidence pointing to such intention; the plaintiff’s inaction could equally have resulted from a calculated risk or mere inadvertence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 There is also some force in the plaintiff’s explanation for why it could not be said to have abetted the contempt of the defendant. Its explanation was that it had no choice but to “raise the necessary objections and preserve its rights in the Bombay High Court Proceedings and in the NCLT” because it had been placed in this unenviable position by the <span class="font-italic">defendant's</span> own impermissible acts.

ORC 6040 is not directly concerned with what the plaintiff does (it does not require the plaintiff to positively oppose breaches) or what the Bombay High Court does (ORC 6040 is certainly not expressed as a prohibition directed at the Bombay High Court). The ASI is directed at the defendant. The moment the defendant filed IA 2827, his breach was committed and consummated, and no further steps (whether from the plaintiff or the Bombay High Court) were necessary. There is no legal requirement for the plaintiff to first “call out” the defendant for his wrongdoing before the Indian courts before it is permitted to raise the defendant’s breach before the Singapore courts and seek a committal order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether it is material that the Bombay High Court granted the EGM Injunction under IA 1010 and not IA 2827</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The defendant places some emphasis on how the Bombay High Court worded its 10 January 2022 Order granting the EGM Injunction:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.

This is evident from the earlier part of the paragraph 4 which records that the Interim Application taken out by the Plaintiff is required to be heard and particularly considering that the Interim Application seeks to restrain Defendant No.2 from acting upon and enforcing the anti-suit injunction order which is now anti-suit permanent injunction by the judgment dated 26.10.2021.

</div> This forms part of the defendant’s broader point that the plaintiff is attempting to use contempt proceedings in Singapore to bar the defendant from seeking reliefs from the Indian courts, which is oppressive and operates to deprive him of access to justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 At the outset, I would state that it is not for this court to comment on the appropriateness of a foreign court granting or not granting an AEI. Equally, however, whether an AEI is granted or not is, in my judgment, not relevant to the <span class="font-italic">committal</span> proceedings before me. I say this for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the defendant might consider that he has a good reason for applying for an AEI from the Indian courts. However, a contemnor’s motives and reasons for disobedience of an order of this court are only relevant (if at all) to mitigation, and not liability for the contempt complained of. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Indian courts may find that there is good reason to grant an AEI, and indeed may choose to do so. That may negate the ASI’s effect within India, but it does nothing to ORC 6040 in Singapore or indeed anywhere else in the world. This is because ORC 6040 continues to act on the defendant <span class="font-italic">in personam</span>.

He explained that, after reading the defendant’s written submissions (and the lack of proper justification for the defendant’s actions that they exposed), he considered a fine to be insufficient, particularly since no effort had been taken by the defendant to purge his contempt. He contended that ordering a term of imprisonment would better signal the court’s disapprobation of the defendant’s conduct.

Further, if a fine were imposed, this ought to be on the lower end of the scale. The NCLT proceedings had been adjourned repeatedly since 2021, with no allegation made contemporaneously that these adjournments amounted to contempt. Filing IA 2827 was a one-off breach, unopposed by the plaintiff, and done with a view to updating the Bombay High Court of relevant developments. Any breach was technical and of no consequence.

</div> However, this is but a bare assertion, and more importantly, does not even suggest that he had received advice on <span class="font-italic">Singapore law</span> concerning whether ORC 6040 might be breached. Legal advice aside, it is telling from the tenor of the defendant’s case that he has primarily relied on technical and collateral defences to try and bring himself <span class="font-italic">just outside</span> of ORC 6040’s ambit (for instance, by trying to separate IA 2827 from Suit 95 to show that it was not “related to” or “connected with” the management of People Interactive or matters set out in the SHA).

It is hard to ignore the impression that the defendant intends to do all he can to proceed with the Indian proceedings, in a deliberate and cynical breach of ORC 6040.

</div> As the court in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp (HC) </span>stated, the relevant inquiry is what the purpose of ORC 6040 is, and how the breach impacted this purpose. Planning can also add to the egregiousness of the contemnor’s conduct. On the facts, the defendant continues to seek an AEI that would, if granted, nullify the permanent ASI’s effect on him, at least in India. He continues to seek a declaration that the NCLT has exclusive jurisdiction, to the exclusion of the arbitral tribunal. He continues to seek reliefs (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the EGM Injunction) that the ASI effectively reserves for the tribunal’s (or seat court’s) determination. It is clear that the defendant’s acts, singly or cumulatively, are all orchestrated to undermine and/or ignore the effect and import of ORC 6040. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Fifth, on remorse, while I agree that no remorse has been displayed by the defendant (in the form of purging the contempt), I <span class="font-weight-bold">disagree</span> that the lack of remorse should be an <span class="font-italic">aggravating</span> factor (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [68(g)]).

</div> The law recognises the presence of remorse to be mitigating. As was held in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>, the absence of remorse is not necessarily aggravating, but it may be so where it points towards a contumacious breach with no intention of remedy. The plaintiff says that this is a contumacious breach with no intention of remedy because the defendant had filed an affidavit in the Bombay High Court proceedings, stating that the Singapore committal proceedings amount to an interference with justice in the Bombay High Court proceedings. In my view, the mere filing of an affidavit is equivocal. It only signals the defendant’s disagreement with the committal proceedings being taken out, which is not too different from the defendant choosing to defend the committal proceedings in Singapore. At best, it confirms that the defendant has not chosen to voluntarily purge his contempt even after the committal proceedings had begun. This just means that he is unremorseful – which, without more, is neutral. In my view, this remains qualitatively different from saying that the defendant has evinced that he is opposed to ever complying with ORC 6040 (for example, even following an unfavourable outcome in CA 64). As such, on the available evidence and submissions, this is not a case where the absence of remorse ought to be regarded as aggravating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In the totality of the circumstances, I find that a fine of $70,000 would be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Purging contempt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 To recapitulate (see [161] above), the plaintiff submits that the defendant should be given two weeks to purge his contempt, failing which he ought to be imprisoned for a month.

At a fundamental level, I have reservations as to whether s 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA empowers me to grant a partial suspension in this manner. I also have reservations about whether this was what the court in <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala </span>(2018) contemplated at [68] – as opposed to a single sentencing outcome that is either fully imposed or not. In any event, the plaintiff has not explained why a global sentence of a $100,000 fine <span class="font-italic">and</span> one month’s imprisonment (should the defendant fail to purge his contempt) would be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with the case law. The plaintiff has only addressed the merits of a $100,000 fine and the merits of a one-month imprisonment term individually. Even on the plaintiff’s own case authorities, the courts have rarely imposed <span class="font-italic">both</span> a fine and imprisonment; indeed, the courts have often placed great emphasis on determining whether a fine <span class="font-italic">or</span> imprisonment would be more appropriate in each case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 On the other hand, if the plaintiff’s submission is in fact the latter (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to impose an imprisonment term in place of a fine), it is again unclear if this is an outcome that s 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AJPA permits and that <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala</span> (2018) envisages. It is also not immediately obvious why a one-month imprisonment term would be, in the circumstances, regarded as an escalated form of punishment that would more strongly deter and punish the defendant than a $100,000 fine, such that the defendant would be induced into purging his contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186  These difficulties are compounded by the plaintiff’s shift in position at the oral hearing, where its primary position became that a custodial sentence ought to be imposed (see [162] above). There is no clarity on what this means for its original submission that one month’s imprisonment should be imposed in default of the defendant purging its contempt – for instance, whether this requires an upward revision of the one-month term, or whether it is to remain unchanged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Notwithstanding these difficulties, I am of the view that the defendant ought to be given a final chance to purge his contempt. As to what this means, I agree with the plaintiff that to purge his contempt, the defendant will have to discontinue the NCLT proceedings, discontinue Suit 95 and all interim applications therein, and further, discharge the EGM Injunction or not oppose it being discharged.

Given my observations at [129] above on the requirements that apply to a Statement of Committal, it follows that the plaintiff cannot pursue an ever-expanding case. To this extent, the plaintiff’s arguments that “[i]t is only where lengthy particulars are needed that the same may be included in a schedule or addendum” and that “there is no procedural rule that the Statement of Committal must particularise the specific portions of the supporting affidavit relied on” consequently fall away.

This is not the first time that the defendant’s pursuit of foreign proceedings has given rise to issues before this court (see the OS 242 Judgment). In clear and continuing defiance, the defendant has ignored the existence and import of ORC 6040. The Indian proceedings remain substantially afoot – indeed, steps have been taken by the defendant to bolster those proceedings and in turn undermine both the ASI and the arbitration agreement in the SHA. The defendant has neither provided a good justification for this, nor has he offered to even begin to purge his contempt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 In the circumstances, I allow prayer 1 of the plaintiff’s application in SUM 1119 in the terms set out below.

Purging the contempt entails: (a) discontinuing the NCLT proceedings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the NCLT Petition); (b) discontinuing Suit 95 and all interim applications therein (including IA 1010 and IA 2827); and (c) either procuring the discharge or setting aside of the EGM Injunction or not opposing any steps taken by the plaintiff (or any other party in the Bombay High Court proceedings) to have it discharged or set aside. For avoidance of doubt, the defendant is expected to take all steps necessary to regularise his position and bring himself in compliance with the ASI granted in ORC 6040. Finally, for the reasons above and in light of the orders made in SUM 1119, I dismiss SUM 2090 entirely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 I shall hear the parties separately on costs. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S Mohan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi SC, Tan May Lian Felicia, Uma Jitendra Sharma and Juliana Lake (Lu Zhixuan) (TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nandakumar Ponniya Servai, Ashish Chugh, Pradeep Nair, Yiu Kai Tai and Yap Yong Li (Wong &amp; Leow LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-center font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
