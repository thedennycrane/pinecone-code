        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties are Belgian nationals who married on
                    25 February 1992. The plaintiff (wife), a housewife, is aged 48 years
                    old and the defendant (husband), a business management consultant, is
                    55 years old. The plaintiff said that she worked briefly as an interior
                    designer from 2006 to 2010 but the defendant disputes this claim. It was not
                    material to my decision. They have a daughter, aged 19 years, who is
                    studying at the LaSalle School of Art; and a son, aged 17 years, studying
                    in the United World College of South East Asia. The family has been living in
                    Singapore since June 2000. They reside at a rented property at No 27 Tudor
                    Close, Tudor Ten Singapore 297954. The plaintiff filed for divorce on
                    25 June 2009 and an interim judgment was granted on 11 June 2010. The
                    parties appeared before me on 24 August 2011 for orders regarding the
                    ancillary matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The division of matrimonial property concerned
                    inter alia three assets. The first is the sale proceeds from an investment of
                    US$300,000.00 made jointly by the parties in May 2007, deposited into one HSBC
                    USD Multi Currency Savings Account (“the New Asia Fund”). The
                    second is a property in Bali, Indonesia, bought for approximately US$300,000.00
                    in 2002 (“the Bali Property”). The third is the monies in two
                    Fintro bank accounts owned by the defendant, which were the proceeds of sale
                    from the parties’ former matrimonial home together with two adjoining
                    garages, in Belgium (“the Belgian Property”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant prefers all matrimonial assets,
                    save for the New Asia Fund, to be placed in a single pool and divided based on
                    the parties’ respective contributions. He proposes that since he made all
                    the financial contributions to the acquisition and maintenance of these assets,
                    a division of 90% to him, with 10% given to the plaintiff in recognition of her
                    non financial contribution, would be fair. He proposes that for the New Asia
                    Fund, as the plaintiff had made financial contributions, she should be awarded
                    17%. The plaintiff claims that she is entitled to 50% of the Fintro accounts as
                    well as 85% of the New Asia Fund. The Bali Property should also be transferred
                    to her as she paid for most of it and did most of the work relating to its
                    construction and management. The extent of financial and non-financial
                    contributions is disputed by both parties. For instance, in relation to the Bali
                    Property, while the plaintiff claimed that she made the bulk of the payments and
                    played a major role in the construction and the management of the property, the
                    defendant says the reverse is true. He claims that he negotiated all the
                    construction contracts and maintained the property. In this regard, the
                    following observation by the High Court in <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen
                        Kai Buan</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 659 at [43] ("<em>Yow Mee
                        Lan</em>") must be borne in mind:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...[M]arriage is not a business where, generally, parties receive an
                        economic reward commensurate with their economic input. It is a union in
                        which the husband and wife work together for their common good and the good
                        of their children. Each of them uses (or should use) his or her abilities
                        and efforts for the welfare of the family and contributes whatever he or she
                        is able to. The parties often have unequal abilities whether as parents or
                        income earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and talents
                        should not result in unequal rewards where the contributions are made
                        consistently and over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The court’s power to order division of
                    matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) must be exercised, as
                    everyone knows, to obtain a “just and equitable” result. How that
                    is to be achieved is the difficult part. In <em>Yeo Chong Lin v
                        Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 at
                    [78], the Court of Appeal recognised that the court was not expected to make an
                    exact calculation of each spouse's contributions, whether financial or
                    non-financial. Since bright lines are rarely clear in such matters, a broad
                    brush approach is often the most appropriate in deciding what constitutes a just
                    and equitable division. In this case, all the indications point to an equal
                    contribution towards the matrimonial assets. I am thus inclined to order an
                    equal division of the matrimonial assets. The parties were married for
                    18 years and were cohabiting about two or three years before marriage. The
                    plaintiff, together with the children, accompanied the defendant when he moved
                    from Belgium to Singapore for work in 2000. I am satisfied that most of the
                    investments made by the couple were in fact joint decisions, with input by both
                    parties, both financially and non-financially. These included the investment in
                    the Bali Property and the New Asia Fund. While the monies in the Fintro bank
                    accounts represent the proceeds of sale of the Belgian property which was
                    purchased by the defendant before marriage, the property was the matrimonial
                    home while the parties were in Belgium. The plaintiff had also helped to
                    maintain, upkeep and improve the property. In addition to the plaintiff’s
                    role as a housewife and caregiver to their two children, she was also a
                    shareholder and director of Bromo Consulting Pte Ltd (“Bromo”),
                    the company used by the defendant to run his business management and consultancy
                    services. Although he claims that her role in the company was merely
                    administrative, it nevertheless indicates the fact that both parties were
                    involved in almost all of their economic endeavours throughout their marriage.
                    In the light of both the financial and non-financial contributions by the
                    plaintiff, she is entitled to a 50% of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Although not directly addressed in the
                    parties’ main submissions, there is an issue of whether the various
                    inter-spousal gifts made by the parties to each other falls within or outside
                    the pool of matrimonial assets. As indicated by the parties’ Ancillary
                    Matters Fact and Position Sheets, the plaintiff argues that such gifts are not
                    matrimonial assets, while the defendant is of the contrary view. In the case of
                        <em>Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee</em> [2011]
                    2 SLR 814 (“<em>Wan Lai
                    Cheng</em>”), the court found that inter-spousal gifts are not
                    matrimonial assets liable to division under s 112 of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”).
                    Section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this section, “matrimonial asset” means —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">any asset

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or
                                one or more of their children while the parties are residing
                                together for shelter or transportation or for household, education,
                                recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(ii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">which has been substantially improved during
                                the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage;
                                and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">any other asset of any nature acquired during the
                            marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage,</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has
                        been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has
                        not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by
                        both parties to the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The reasons given in <em>Wan Lai Cheng</em>
                    seemed to be based on a technical reading of the provision. Firstly, on a plain
                    reading of the provision, there is no distinction made between inter-spousal
                    gifts and third-party gifts. Both types of gifts should therefore fall within
                    the exclusionary phrase and not be considered matrimonial assets. The other
                    reason was that when amendments to the Women’s Charter were under
                    consideration in 1996, both Professor Leong Wai Kum and The Law Reform Committee
                    of the Singapore Academy of Law had proposed to the Select Committee that a
                    distinction be made between the two types of gift. Both Professor Leong and the
                    Law Reform Committee had put forward draft definitions of “matrimonial
                    assets” which specifically included inter-spousal gifts. Nevertheless,
                    these proposed definitions were not adopted and s 112(10) in its current
                    form was enacted. Accordingly, the court in <em>Wan Lai
                        Cheng</em> was of the view that the new definition in s 112(10)
                    had changed an earlier Court of Appeal ruling that inter-spousal gifts are
                    matrimonial assets. I had expressed my views on this question in <em>Tan Cheng Guan v Tan Hwee Lee</em> [2011] SGHC 216
                        (“<em>Tan Cheng Guan</em>”) and will now
                    only add the following points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Prior to the amendments to the Women’s
                    Charter in 1996, the Court of Appeal had in the case of <em>Yeo
                        Gim Tong Michael v Tianzon Lolita</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 633
                        (“<em>Tianzon</em>”) held that gifts
                    acquired by one spouse and given to the other fell to be included within
                    s 112 [previously s 106] of the Women’s Charter, no matter what the
                    intention of the spouses regarding the gift at the time it was made. The
                    rationale was explained by LP Thean JA at [12] of the judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...In considering the issue of a gift in the division of matrimonial
                        assets under s 106, the starting point is whether the subject matter of the
                        gift is property originally acquired during the marriage through the sole
                        effort of the donor or the joint efforts of the donor and his or her spouse,
                        the recipient. If the property was so acquired during the marriage, it falls
                        within sub-s (1) or (3) (as the case may be) of s 106, and depending on the
                        circumstances would be taken into account in the division of matrimonial
                        assets, notwithstanding that it was a gift from one spouse to the other. The
                        spouse who made the gift would have no doubt expended moneys in acquiring
                        it. The fact that the gift was contemporaneously or immediately thereafter
                        or later transferred to the other spouse does not affect the original
                        acquisition of that gift. Such a gift was nonetheless acquired by the donor
                        and not the recipient, and if it was acquired during the marriage it would
                        fall within the class of assets covered by s 106. However, where the subject
                        matter of the gift is itself a gift from a third party, for instance from a
                        parent of the donor, then the gift is not property acquired by the donor by
                        any effort on his part and it follows that that property would not fall
                        within s 106...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I am of the view that the distinction drawn by the Court of Appeal
                    between third party gifts and inter-spousal gifts is a principle that remains
                    applicable even after the enactment of s 112(10) in 1996. As pointed out by
                    Debbie Ong and Valerie Thean in (2000) 1 SAL Ann Rev 180 at 193, such a
                    distinction would be sensible because, where inter-spousal gifts are concerned,
                    the husband would have to expend efforts or liquidate other assets to acquire
                    the gift for his recipient wife. The gift, having been acquired through the
                    personal efforts of one or both of the spouses during the subsistence of their
                    marriage, is properly a matrimonial asset. Transfers between the parties
                        <em>inter se</em> over the course of their marriage do
                    not alienate the gift from the pool of matrimonial assets. This view can be
                    supported by a construction of s 112(10)(b) of the Women’s Charter,
                    which is the applicable sub-provision here. While the use of the word
                    ‘gift’ in the exclusionary phrase does not distinguish between
                    third-party and inter-spousal gifts, it not only excludes ‘gifts’,
                    but also ‘inheritances’. The exemption goes on to provide that if
                    such ‘gifts’ and ‘inheritances’ had been substantially
                    improved by the effort of either the other party or by both spouses, they would
                    nevertheless be considered matrimonial assets. The crucial point is therefore
                    whether the asset was acquired or substantially improved, through the sole or
                    joint efforts of the parties during the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This also seems to be the conclusion reached in
                        <em>Yow Mee Lan</em>, although the court did not
                    specifically discuss the gift exclusion in s 112(10) of the Women’s
                    Charter. In <em>Yow Mee Lan</em>, the court at [63] and
                    [64] noted that the court’s power to divide gifts between spouses has been
                    established beyond a doubt in <em>Tianzon</em> and that if
                    the gift was derived from the efforts of the husband, there was no doubt that it
                    was properly a matrimonial asset. In doing so, the court distinguished the case
                    of <em>Lee Leh Hua v Yip Kok Leong</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 554 as an exceptional case, where the equities of the
                    situation were clearly against a retraction by the husband of his gift (see
                        <em>Yow Mee Lan</em> at [68]). As a matter of
                    conceptual clarity, inter-spousal gifts can clearly be distinguished from
                    third-party gifts and inheritances and ought not to fall within the scope of the
                    exclusionary phrase. While my views differ from the position adopted in
                        <em>Wan Lai Cheng</em>, it ought to be pointed out that
                    there ultimately will be little difference in the end result for most cases. In
                        <em>Wan Lai Cheng</em>, although the court found that
                    inter-spousal gifts were not matrimonial assets under s 112(10) of the
                    Women’s Charter, it relied on s 112(2)(h) read with s 114(1)(a),
                    which ultimately allowed the court to take the gifts into consideration in
                    determining each party’s share of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In relation to the Bali Property, despite the
                    defendant having no professional valuation, he valued it at S$880,000.00. In
                    contrast, the plaintiff had commissioned a professional valuation for it and it
                    was valued at S$1,249,277.87. I would accept the valuation done by the plaintiff
                    as the value of the property. In light of the foregoing, the pool of matrimonial
                    assets available for division would therefore comprise as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The total value of the matrimonial assets is
                    approximately S$2,201,529.07, to be split equally between the parties. In
                    accordance with my decision in <em>Tan Cheng Guan</em> at
                        [3], the inter-spousal gifts are to
                    remain with the respective parties; however, the gifts are to form part of the
                    50% share awarded to each party. Additionally, I note that both parties have
                    made allegations of a lack of full and frank disclosure on the part of the
                    opposing party. However, I find that these allegations are not made out on the
                    evidence before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the issue of maintenance, I am satisfied
                    that the maintenance ordered by the District Judge below should be allowed to
                    stand, with liberty to apply. While the plaintiff had asked for additional
                    maintenance for her medical condition, I am of the view that since the defendant
                    is already taking care of most of the household and children’s expenses,
                    it would be reasonable for the plaintiff to contribute to her own medical
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As the parties have agreed for both to have
                    joint custody of the children, with care and control given to the plaintiff with
                    reasonable access to the defendant, I order accordingly. I will hear parties on
                    costs on a later date.</p>
