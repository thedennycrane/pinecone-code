<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These are related appeals by the appellants
                    against the decision of the District Judge (“the trial judge”)
                    convicting them on various charges of theft. The trial judge’s grounds of
                    decision are reported in <em>Public Prosecutor v Geyabalan s/o K
                        Ramiah and Another</em> [2014] SGDC 41 (“the
                    GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Geyabalan s/o K Ramiah
                    (“Geyabalan”) and Nagas s/o Arumugam (“Nagas”)
                    (collectively, “the Appellants”) were alleged to have stolen gold
                    jewellery from passengers’ bags while on duty as baggage handlers at
                    Changi Airport. They were charged with various counts of theft and disposing
                    stolen property, and claimed trial to their respective charges. At the end of
                    their joint trial, they were each found guilty of four charges of theft and
                    acquitted of the rest of the charges against them. Geyabalan was sentenced to a
                    total of six months’ imprisonment. Nagas was sentenced to a total of eight
                    months’ imprisonment. Geyabalan now appeals against his conviction whereas
                    Nagas appeals against both his conviction and sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellants were previously employed as
                    baggage handlers in the Budget Terminal at Changi Airport. The Appellants
                    belonged to the same team of baggage handlers, comprising the Appellants, one
                    Selvakumar s/o Kanniappan (“Selvakumar”), one Ashley Francis
                    (“Francis”), and one Neo Thiam Chye. Nagas was the team leader or
                    “skipper”. Their job was to load passengers’ baggage into
                    the cargo holds of planes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On various dates in 2010 and 2011, there were
                    complaints made by numerous passengers who had travelled on Tiger Airways
                    flights from Singapore to India that the jewellery in their check-in luggage had
                    gone missing. On 14 September 2011, the police seized a number of jewellery
                    from “Soon Hong” pawnshop located at Block 118 Rivervale Drive,
                    #01-14 (“the Pawnshop”), which had been pawned under Nagas’
                    name. Some of these jewellery were subsequently identified as belonging to the
                    passengers who had travelled on Tiger Airways flights and who had reported
                    missing jewellery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellants were charged with various counts
                    of theft and disposing stolen property. Geyabalan claimed trial to eight charges
                    of theft under s 379 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008
                    Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”). Nagas claimed trial to six charges of
                    theft under s 379 read with s 34 of the Penal Code and three charges
                    of voluntarily assisting in the disposal of stolen property under s 414(1)
                    of the Penal Code. For ease of reference, Annex A below sets out a table with
                    the details of the proceeded charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The evidence in the proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Prosecution called a total of 18 witnesses.
                    Ten of these witnesses were passengers who had travelled on Tiger Airways
                    flights from Singapore to India and whose jewellery in their check-in luggage
                    had gone missing (collectively, “the Complainants”). Other
                    witnesses included a representative of the Pawnshop, the ramp service manager
                    who supervised the baggage handlers at the Budget Terminal, and various police
                    officers who had been involved in the seizure of the jewellery from the Pawnshop
                    and the investigation of the case. The key Prosecution witness was Selvakumar
                    (“PW9”) who testified as to the Appellants’ involvement in
                    the alleged thefts. PW9 had earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of theft and
                    another charge of criminal misappropriation, with six other charges taken into
                    consideration, and was sentenced to a total of two months and three weeks’
                    imprisonment. Francis had also earlier pleaded guilty to one charge of theft,
                    with two similar charges taken into consideration, and was sentenced to nine
                    weeks’ imprisonment. However, Francis did not give evidence at the
                    Appellants’ trial because he had been deported back to Malaysia after
                    serving his sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Prosecution presented four main strands of
                    evidence. First, there was PW9’s testimony that he had acted together with
                    the Appellants and Francis in committing thefts of jewellery from
                    passengers’ baggage while they were on duty as baggage handlers at the
                    Budget Terminal. PW9 testified that each theft was committed pursuant to a prior
                    agreement between all of them and was a joint effort which involved at least
                    three or four team members. According to PW9, Nagas was the mastermind who
                    coordinated the thefts from the ground while he, Geyabalan, and Francis removed
                    the jewellery from the baggage. The three of them would then pass the stolen
                    items to Nagas, who would arrange for the jewellery to be brought out of the
                    airport, pawn off the jewellery, and pay part of the proceeds to the other two
                    or three accomplices. PW9 also said that he had personally witnessed Francis and
                    Geyabalan taking items from passengers’ baggage. However, PW9 could not
                    recall or identify on which dates and which flights the alleged thefts took
                    place, and what jewellery was stolen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Second, the Complainants gave evidence that the
                    jewellery in their check-in luggage for Tiger Airways flights from Singapore to
                    India had been stolen . They described how they were able to identify some of
                    their missing jewellery among the items that were seized from the Pawnshop and
                    how they had acquired those pieces of jewellery. Some of the Complainants
                    produced receipts proving the purchase of the jewellery which they had lost
                    and/or photographs showing themselves or their family members wearing the said
                    jewellery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Third, records from the Pawnshop and the
                    testimony of the representative from the Pawnshop showed that the jewellery
                    seized from the Pawnshop were indeed pawned by Nagas. According to the
                    Prosecution, the proximity in time between the alleged thefts, the dates on
                    which the items were pawned, and the items which were pawned together on each
                    occasion, further corroborated the Appellants’ guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Fourth, the Prosecution adduced the attendance
                    records kept by the Appellants’ employer which showed that the Appellants
                    were on duty and assigned to the corresponding flights which involved jewellery
                    from passengers’ check-in luggage being stolen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Both Appellants denied the charges against
                    them and testified that they had not committed any theft of jewellery from
                    passengers’ baggage. They said that PW9 had falsely implicated them.
                    However, they could not point to any motive for doing so. In Nagas’ case,
                    he further denied the allegations that the pawned jewellery were stolen. Nagas
                    testified that all the jewellery pawned by him at the Pawnshop belonged to him
                    and his wife, which they kept as a “reserve” and would pawn
                    whenever they needed cash. Further, Nagas said that he was absent from work on
                    two dates (<em>viz</em>, 14 and 16 April 2010) on
                    which thefts were alleged to have taken place as he was on medical leave; it was
                    therefore not possible for him to have committed theft on those two
                    dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Defence also called a third witness, Staff
                    Sergeant Sujantha (“Sujantha”), to give evidence. Sujantha’s
                    evidence primarily related to a statement she recorded from PW9 on
                    14 September 2011 at the Airport Police Division (“D5”). In
                    the statement, PW9 expressly stated that Nagas was not involved in the thefts.
                    PW9 recanted from this position in his later statements to the police as well as
                    on the witness stand. PW9 said that he had lied in his earlier statement D5
                    because he feared that Nagas would do something to his family, and also because
                    Sujantha had taken the statement in a threatening manner. Against this,
                    Sujantha’s evidence was that she had never threatened PW9 in any way
                    during the recording of the statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 7 November 2013, the trial judge
                    convicted the Appellants on four charges of theft each and granted an acquittal
                    for the rest of the charges. Geyabalan was convicted on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and
                    6th charges, and given a discharge amounting to an acquittal for the 4th, 5th,
                    7th, and 8th charges. Nagas was convicted on the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th
                    charges, and given a discharge amounting to an acquittal for the 2nd, 3rd, 8th,
                    13th, and 14th charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     For the charges on which the Appellants were
                    convicted, the trial judge was satisfied that the direct and circumstantial
                    evidence adduced by the Prosecution was sufficient to establish the
                    Appellants’ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. First, the trial judge was
                    satisfied that the evidence of the Complainants were reliable as they were able
                    to identify the jewellery recovered from the Pawnshop as belonging to them. A
                    proper procedure was also undertaken for the purpose of identifying the
                    jewellery. Second, the trial judge found that PW9 was a “credible and
                    reliable” witness and accepted his evidence that he, Francis, and the
                    Appellants would usually commit the thefts together. Third, the trial judge
                    considered documentary evidence such as the pawn tickets and the records of the
                    Pawnshop which showed that Nagas had pawned the items identified by the
                    Complainants as being those that were stolen from them. He also considered cthe
                    attendance records of the baggage handlers and the clock-in cards of the
                    Appellants which proved that the Appellants were present for work on some of the
                    dates when the thefts were alleged to have taken place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As for the charges on which the Appellants
                    were acquitted, these charges related to dates on which the attendance records
                    showed that either Nagas or PW9 was not present at work. The Appellants were
                    therefore acquitted of these charges since there was doubt as to whether the
                    alleged thefts on those dates had taken place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 21 January 2014, the trial judge
                    sentenced Geyabalan to three months’ imprisonment on each of the four
                    theft charges with two of the sentences to run consecutively, resulting in a
                    total sentence of six months’ imprisonment. Nagas was sentenced to four
                    months’ imprisonment on each of the four theft charges with two of the
                    sentences to run consecutively, resulting in a total sentence of eight
                    months’ imprisonment. The trial judge accepted the Prosecution’s
                    submission that the sentencing principle of general deterrence applied in this
                    case since the offences had caused distress and inconvenience to the victims,
                    and since such offences would damage Singapore’s reputation as an
                    international aviation hub. The trial judge also considered the following
                    aggravating factors: (1) there was premeditation as the Appellants would discuss
                    and plan with PW9 and Francis before embarking on their crime; (2) the offences
                    took place over a substantial period of time (between 2010 and 2011); (3) the
                    Appellants had breached the trust placed in them as baggage handlers; and (4)
                    the value of the items was substantial and some of the items had sentimental
                    value. Finally, the trial judge took into account the sentences which had been
                    imposed on the Appellants’ accomplices, PW9 and Francis, the fact that the
                    Appellants had claimed trial, as well as the Appellants’ respective roles
                    in the offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Before me, both of the Appellants raised
                    several grounds of appeal against their respective convictions. Geyabalan argued
                    that the Prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt for the
                    charges on which he was convicted since there is no evidence to show that he had
                    removed the jewellery from the baggage on the dates specified in the charges or
                    that he was linked to the pawning of the jewellery. He also submitted that PW9
                    is not a reliable witness and that the trial judge had erred by giving excessive
                    weight to PW9’s evidence. Moreover, the trial judge had erred in not
                    giving due consideration to the possibility that the thefts could have been
                    committed by persons other than the Appellants, such as the additional workers
                    who were often deployed to assist them in their baggage-handling
                duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Nagas similarly argued that the trial judge
                    had erred in relying on PW9’s evidence. PW9’s evidence contains
                    material discrepancies such as the discrepancy between his statement D5, which
                    does not mention Nagas’ involvement, and his later statements, which
                    implicate Nagas. He also argued that the trial judge had erred in relying on the
                    evidence of the Complainants to convict him as the trial judge did not consider
                    the possibility that the items identified by the Complainants could simply be
                    similar to those owned by Nagas. Further, Nagas submitted that the trial judge
                    had erred in rejecting the Appellants’ evidence and other circumstantial
                    evidence in favour of the Appellants, such as Nagas’ conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em> the pawning of the jewellery, which is
                    consistent with his plea of innocence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In contrast, the Prosecution’s position
                    is that the trial judge was justified in relying on the evidence of the
                    Complainants and PW9, who is a credible and consistent witness. The Prosecution
                    argued that the direct evidence of the Complainants and PW9, taken together with
                    the circumstantial evidence of the records from the Pawnshop and the attendance
                    records, form an interlocking chain of evidence that point inexorably to the
                    Appellants’ involvement in the thefts. Although PW9 was unable to recall
                    the precise dates on which each piece of jewellery was stolen, it is the
                    evidence in totality, rather than PW9’s evidence in isolation, which
                    establishes the Appellants’ guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Nagas also appeals against his sentence of
                    eight months’ imprisonment, which he argued is manifestly
                    excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The key question that arises for determination
                    in the present appeals is whether the Prosecution has proven its case beyond a
                    reasonable doubt. In answering this question, it is imperative to examine the
                    two main planks of the Prosecution’s case, the evidence of the
                    Complainants and PW9, which are now in contention. It is not disputed by either
                    of the Appellants that the jewellery seized from the Pawnshop were indeed pawned
                    by Nagas, or that the Appellants were both on duty and assigned to the
                    particular flights on the dates the alleged thefts took place. This, however, is
                    merely neutral evidence and is necessary but insufficient to establish the
                    Appellants’ guilt. In order for the Appellants’ respective
                    convictions to be upheld, the Prosecution needs to establish the following
                    beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that PW9’s evidence implicating the
                    Appellants in the thefts is credible and compelling enough to sustain the
                    Appellants’ conviction; and (2) that the jewellery pawned by Nagas are
                    stolen property belonging to the Complainants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I will therefore consider the evidence of PW9
                    and the Complainants in turn, before dealing with the Appellants’
                    respective convictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Evidence of PW9</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Observations on accomplice evidence, motive, and witness
                credibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     PW9 gave direct evidence that he, Francis, and
                    the Appellants were jointly involved in the thefts of jewellery from
                    passengers’ baggage. As PW9 was allegedly an accomplice of the Appellants,
                    the trial judge considered the law as to the treatment of evidence of
                    accomplices as encapsulated in Illustration (<em>b</em>) to
                    s 116 and s 135 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). Those provisions
                    affirm the principle that the court may convict an accused based on the
                    uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, but should still treat such evidence
                    with caution as the accomplice may, and not must, be presumed to be unworthy of
                    credit: <em>Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1998] 2 SLR(R) 211 at [29]; <em>Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 342 at [15]. The trial judge was of
                    the opinion that PW9 was a credible witness notwithstanding the fact that he was
                    an accomplice of the Appellants since he had already been convicted and
                    sentenced for his involvement in the theft offences. There was also no evidence
                    of any spite on the part of PW9 towards the Appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     This calls to mind the issue of which party
                    bears the burden of proving a motive (or lack thereof) on the part of a witness
                    to falsely implicate an accused person. In an oft-cited passage from the High
                    Court case of <em>Khoo Kwoon Hain v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591, Yong Pung How CJ stated (at [71]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The burden of proving a lack of motive to falsely implicate the
                        appellant is on the Prosecution. Even though the Prosecution was making a
                        negative assertion, the burden of proof is still on it. It is not for the
                        defendant to prove that the complainant had some reason to falsely accuse
                        him. This is a fact that would be wholly within the complainant’s
                        knowledge and nobody else’s. The Defence therefore cannot be expected
                        to prove this. It would be a circular argument to believe the complainant
                        when she said that she had no reason to falsely accuse the appellant, and
                        then say from that that the complainant is believed because she had no
                        reason to falsely accuse the appellant. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     While the passage above appears to imply that
                    the burden of proof falls in the first instance on the Prosecution to show a
                    lack of motive on the part of the witness to falsely implicate the accused
                    person, it has been clarified in subsequent cases that this is not exactly the
                    position to be adopted. In <em>Goh Han Heng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 374 at [33], Yong CJ clarified
                    that the above passage simply meant that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]here the accused can show that the complainant has a motive to
                        false implicate him, then the burden must fall on the Prosecution to
                        disprove that motive. This does not mean that the accused merely needs to
                        allege that the complainant has a motive to falsely implicate him. Instead,
                        the accused must adduce sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise
                        reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. Only then would the burden
                        of proof shift to the Prosecution to prove that there was no such motive.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Therefore, as the law stands, the Defence
                    first has to adduce sufficient evidence of a motive on the part of the witness
                    to frame the accused person before the burden shifts to the Prosecution to
                    disprove that motive: see <em>Gan Too Cheh v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 220 at [23] and <em>XP
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 (“<em>XP v PP</em>”) at [21]. However, if a trial judge
                    wishes to make a finding that a complainant or prosecution witness had no reason
                    to falsely implicate the accused person, the trial judge must base such a
                    finding on credible evidence. It is not sufficient for the trial judge to rely
                    only on the fact that the accused person cannot venture any reasons why the
                    complainant or witness would lie in court to falsely implicate him: <em>Loo See Mei v Public Prosecutor</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 27 at
                    [39].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the present case, neither of the Appellants
                    could point to any particular reason why PW9 would want to falsely implicate
                    them in the thefts. Nevertheless, the trial judge considered the undisputed fact
                    that PW9 had already been convicted and had served his sentence in relation to
                    the thefts. Implicit in the trial judge’s decision was the conclusion that
                    there was no motive for PW9 to falsely implicate the Appellants. In the light of
                    the principles elucidated above, I am of the view that the trial judge was
                    entitled to arrive at such a finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, that PW9 did not have a motive to
                    falsely implicate the Appellants does not necessarily mean that he did not in
                    fact do so, or that his evidence should be deemed credible or cogent. It cannot
                    mean that his evidence should be accepted wholesale. In other words, motive and
                    conduct ought not to be conflated. This point was succinctly made by
                    V K Rajah JA in <em>XP v PP</em> in the
                    context of allegations of collusion among complainants as follows (at
                    [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>[W]hat really matters in the final analysis is whether it
                            can be established that the witness did or did not in fact falsely
                            implicate the accused. Motive and conduct remain legally distinct
                            concepts and ought not to be conflated.</em> The Prosecution can
                        successfully rebut allegations of collusion without having to prove beyond a
                        reasonable doubt that the witnesses in question had no motive or reason to
                        make a false complaint, if, for example, there were independent eyewitnesses
                        or other real evidence independently establishing the truth of the
                        complaint. If the witness could not possibly have made a false complaint,
                        then his motive is irrelevant. Conversely, a finding that the witnesses in
                        question had no motive to make a false complaint would often (and not
                        invariably) lead to the conclusion that they did not in fact do so, but this
                        in itself is not the determinative inquiry in considering the possibility of
                        collusion. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The ultimate inquiry therefore relates to
                    PW9’s credibility as a witness. It is well-established that an appellate
                    court should exercise restraint in reviewing a trial judge’s assessment of
                    a witness’ credibility since the trial judge has had the benefit of
                    observing the witness in court. However, a favourable perception of his
                    demeanour alone does not invariably immunise the trial judge’s decision
                    from appellate scrutiny. A witness may be observed to have testified in a frank
                    and forthright manner but if he cannot recall or satisfactorily explain material
                    facts and assertions, his credible demeanour cannot overcome such deficiencies:
                        <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (“<em>Jagatheesan</em>”) at [41]; <em>XP v
                        PP</em> at [71]. Moreover, where the internal consistency of the
                    content of the witness’ evidence or the external consistency between the
                    content of the witness’ evidence and the extrinsic evidence is concerned,
                    an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial court to assess the
                    reliability and veracity of the witness’ evidence: see <em>Jagatheesan</em> at [40], citing <em>Public Prosecutor
                        v Choo Thiam Hock</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 702 at [11].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In this case, the trial judge found PW9 to be
                    honest and forthright in giving his evidence in court and opined that he was a
                    credible and reliable witness. This finding by the trial judge appeared to be
                    premised on a number of matters, including his observation of PW9’s
                    demeanour while PW9 was giving evidence, PW9’s explanation as to why he
                    had not mentioned Nagas’ involvement in the statement D5, the fact that
                    PW9 consistently maintained the involvement of the Appellants, Francis, and
                    himself in the thefts at the airport, and PW9’s detailed description of
                    the team’s <em>modus operandi</em> for carrying out
                    the thefts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In my view, however, there are a number of
                    material deficiencies in PW9’s evidence that were not or were not
                    sufficiently dealt with by the trial judge, and which cast significant doubts on
                    both its veracity and sufficiency in relation to the conviction of the
                    Appellants. I shall elaborate on these deficiencies in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Inability to recall specific details of the offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the first place, PW9’s evidence is
                    woefully lacking in specificity and detail. He conceded time and again that he
                    was unable to tell the court or identify on which dates and which flights the
                    alleged thefts took place and what jewellery were stolen. In fact, PW9 said that
                    he could not remember any dates on which the alleged thefts had been committed
                    even when the investigation officer had asked him during the course of
                    investigations. The only incident which PW9 had any recollection of is the
                    alleged theft of eight gold bangles that took place on 11 January 2011; but
                    even then, he said that he only remembered the act of taking the eight gold
                    bangles and not the time, month, and year when this was committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In his statement D5 recorded on 14 September
                    2011, PW9 stated that he had witnessed Geyabalan and Francis removing money and
                    jewellery from passengers’ luggage on three occasions. However, when he
                    was questioned on this statement by defence counsel, he claimed not to remember
                    the dates, times, or flights of these three occasions, or how much money and
                    jewellery they took. His answers were ambivalent and even appeared to suggest
                    that he did not know whether the statement was true or false since he claimed
                    that he might have made it out of fear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Notwithstanding that PW9 had pleaded guilty to
                    the charges against him, it appears that he was unable to recall any details
                    pertaining to his commission of the offences. He admitted that at the point in
                    time when he pleaded guilty and consented to have the charges against him taken
                    into consideration, he “couldn’t remember any of the details, the
                    facts of the case and the items stolen”. He explained his decision to
                    plead guilty as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">…Counsel asked me, you say there are 8
                            charges, did you commit them? I said I have already admitted, I have
                            already given statement, I have already signed it. And I said, please
                            fight for me---and please fight for me and he was fighting this case for
                            1 year. While in the midst of fighting for my case he told me, you
                            don’t have the money to fight this case, so you admit, he told me.
                            So I admitted.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In relation to the <em>modus
                        operandi</em> of the alleged thefts, PW9’s evidence is that the
                    stolen jewellery could be taken out of the airport because security screening
                    was lax. However, this is inconsistent with the evidence of other witnesses that
                    the baggage handlers would have to go through a thorough body search by a police
                    officer after they completed their duties. PW9 maintained that during the period
                    when he was working as a baggage handler, it was not a practice to have the
                    workers screened or checked. This, however, is contradicted by Mr Roslan Abdul
                    Rahman (“Roslan”), the ramp service manager who was in charge of
                    supervising Nagas’ team of baggage handlers. Roslan testified that the
                    practice from mid-2010 onwards was that an additional police officer would be
                    stationed below the cargo compartment, and there was a requirement that the
                    person who was doing the loading of the baggage had to come down and report to
                    the police officer and go through a thorough body search. This is also the
                    evidence of the Appellants. In my view, PW9’s evidence does not
                    sufficiently address how the team was able to carry out the thefts despite these
                    stringent security screenings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Inconsistent evidence on the number and identity of
                accomplices</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     PW9’s evidence as to the number and
                    identity of accomplices is also inconsistent, particularly in relation to the
                    question of whether all four of them (<em>viz</em>, PW9,
                    Francis, and the Appellants) needed to be there in order for the thefts to be
                    committed. At various points, PW9 seemed to be certain that all four of them
                    needed to be there:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Now Mr. Selvakumar, from what you know, were there
                            any times when items were stolen, when not all 4 of you were around, say
                            maybe one or more was on leave, not at work.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">To do this you need 4 people and we will only do it
                            if we 4 are there.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, PW9 later testified that before
                    Francis joined their team, a Malay driver was involved in carrying out the
                    thefts:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So before Francis joined the---you---you,
                            [Geyabalan] and Nagas has never done it by yourself? Yes or no? Have you
                            done it or you have not done it?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We have, but---we have, but 4 people---4
                            people.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Who are the 4?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">At that time there was a shortage of 1 person. Then
                            sometime there will be a Malay driver. The Malay driver will be pulling
                            the van. Nagas will be the lookout. I and [Geyabalan] will do it
                            upstairs.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     PW9 had not mentioned the involvement of the
                    Malay driver in any of his statements. He said that he had told the police about
                    this Malay driver but later said that he had not told the police about the Malay
                    driver because he was not asked. Confusingly, PW9 also seemed to agree in
                    re-examination that before the Malay driver was involved, thefts were committed
                    only by PW9 and the Appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     PW9’s testimony that a theft could not
                    be done alone and that all four accomplices were needed to do it also does not
                    sit well with the fact that he had earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of
                    dishonest misappropriation of an envelope containing 60,000 Indian rupees for
                    which no other accused persons appeared to be involved. It appears from the
                    charge and the statement of facts that this offence was not committed by anyone
                    else other than PW9. PW9 however maintained under cross-examination that
                    Francis, the Appellants, and himself had done it together.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discrepancies regarding Nagas’ involvement in the
                thefts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     There is also some controversy regarding the
                    statement D5, PW9’s first police statement recorded by Sujantha (see [12]
                    above). In that statement, PW9 had stated unequivocally that Nagas was not
                    involved in the thefts. In PW9’s later statements and on the stand,
                    however, he recanted from this position. He gave various reasons for his alleged
                    initial untruthfulness and why he said that Nagas was not involved. At certain
                    points, PW9 said that he did not mention Nagas out of fear that Nagas would
                    “do something” and because he was concerned with the safety of his
                    wife and children. This explanation was accepted by the trial judge. However,
                    PW9 was not able to give a rational explanation of why he was specifically
                    afraid of Nagas, and conceded that Nagas had never threatened him or any of his
                    family members. At another point, PW9 said that the statement D5 was taken by
                    Sujantha in a “threatening manner” and that she “kept
                    threatening me to take the statements so I didn’t tell her the
                    truth”. Later, however, PW9 claimed that Sujantha had not threatened him.
                    Sujantha also testified that she had not threatened him in any way. To add to
                    the confusion, in the course of his cross-examination, PW9 said that he had not
                    mentioned Nagas’ name because it did not occur to him that he should
                    mention Nagas’ involvement when the statement was recorded. This appears
                    to be in direct contradiction to his earlier evidence that he had suppressed
                    Nagas’ name out of fear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Moreover, PW9’s testimony that Nagas had
                    to be present for the thefts to be committed does not comport with the
                    undisputed fact that Nagas was on medical leave on certain dates when the thefts
                    were alleged to have taken place. When PW9 was asked whether Nagas had been
                    present on 14 and 16 April 2010 and had committed thefts on those dates, PW9
                    said that this “could be [the case]” and reiterated his evidence
                    that they would only commit the thefts if Nagas was there. PW9 had also admitted
                    to having two charges taken into consideration in respect of thefts on those
                    dates. However, the attendance records show that Nagas was absent from work on
                    14 and 16 April 2010 as he was on medical leave. Although Nagas was acquitted of
                    the charges in relation to theft committed on these two dates, the discrepancy
                    in PW9’s evidence in this respect simply reinforces the inference that his
                    evidence in respect of all the alleged thefts is wholly
                unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Evidence of the Complainants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As for the evidence of the Complainants, I am
                    not persuaded that this establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the jewellery
                    pawned by Nagas at the Pawnshop are indeed jewellery which belonged to the
                    Complainants. Reviewing their testimonies as well as the documentary evidence
                    such as the receipts of the Complainants and photographs of their family members
                    wearing the jewellery, I am prepared to accept that the Complainants had indeed
                    owned jewellery which they lost while travelling on their respective flights
                    from Singapore to India. The uncertainty, however, relates to the identification
                    process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It was conceded by most of the Complainants
                    that the jewellery identified by them were not custom-made and did not have any
                    special distinguishing feature. It is therefore difficult to say for certain
                    that the jewellery identified by the Complainants are the <em>exact</em> same jewellery that had been found missing from their
                    check-in luggage. One witness, for example, conceded that the item he had
                    identified was “similar” but not the same as the one he had lost.
                    Another witness who testified that he had lost eight gold bangles from his
                    check-in luggage conceded that the bangles he had identified had the same design
                    as those belonging to him but were not necessarily the same. Another witness,
                    Anita Nirmala Anthony Raj (“PW7”), identified a gold chain with a
                    pendant with an anchor design as belonging to her and stated that the gold chain
                    came with an inscription “MYS”, which stood for “Mayur
                    Jewellers Bangalore”. Upon verification by the investigation officer, the
                    inscription on the gold chain was discovered to be “NVS” instead.
                    Even taking the similarity in initials into account, the fact remains that the
                    inscription is not a custom inscription but is insteada standard mark of the
                    shop that sold the chain. Therefore, I cannot rule out the possibility that the
                    jewellery items seized from the Pawnshop are merely similar to those owned by
                    the Complainants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     This possibility is further reinforced by the
                    undisputed evidence that Nagas had been regularly pawning jewellery items for a
                    number of years before the alleged thefts, and that the jewellery identified by
                    the Complainants is only a fraction of the total number of items that had been
                    pawned by Nagas and seized by the police from the Pawnshop. The evidence of the
                    Pawnshop representative, Mr Tan Chor Hui, is that he had known Nagas for six to
                    seven years and that Nagas had been coming to the pawnshop to pawn items since
                    2004. The investigation officer in charge of the case, Mr Dinesh Vishnu
                    (“Dinesh”), stated that the number of jewellery identified is only
                    “about a quarter” of the total number of gold jewellery that was
                    seized by the police from the Pawnshop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Pertinently, I note that all except two of the
                    Complainants had said that their jewellery had been contained in their
                    hand-carry luggage, which were eventually checked-in because a Tiger Airways
                    staff or airport staff had informed them that there was no more space in the
                    cabin or overhead compartments. Unfortunately, the possibility of the staff
                    members to whom the bags were handed to having stolen the jewellery was not
                    explored by the police. Dinesh, the investigation officer, conceded that he did
                    not check with Tiger Airways which aircraft crew were on duty that day or who
                    the bags had been handed over to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Appellants’ convictions should be upheld </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At the outset, I note that the trial judge did
                    not draw a distinction between Geyabalan and Nagas’ respective charges and
                    appeared to consider the evidence as applying to both of them equally. With
                    respect, this approach is erroneous. The evidence of the Complainants, which
                    form a main plank of the Prosecution’s case, is clearly less relevant to
                    Geyabalan than to Nagas. As Geyabalan pointed out, he was not caught stealing
                    jewellery from passengers’ baggage or found to be in possession of the
                    stolen jewellery. The records from the Pawnshop only confirm that <em>Nagas</em> had pawned the items that were seized and
                    subsequently identified by the Complainants as belonging to them. Neither is
                    there any evidence from Nagas implicating Geyabalan in the alleged thefts or in
                    the pawning of the jewellery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Thus, in so far as Geyabalan is concerned, the
                    only evidence that implicates him in the alleged thefts is the attendance
                    records showing that he was present and on duty on those dates and for those
                    flights which involved jewellery being allegedly stolen from check-in luggage,
                    as well as PW9’s testimony. However, pursuant to the discussion above, I
                    do not find PW9 a credible or reliable witness given the material discrepancies
                    in his evidence, both internal and external. While PW9’s demeanour as
                    assessed by the trial judge may have been that of a credible witness, this does
                    not change the fact that his evidence is inconsistent and lacking in
                    particulars. He was not able to recall details of the offences despite his
                    assertions that he had personally witnessed the other accomplices taking
                    jewellery from passengers’ baggage. He also gave inconsistent evidence on
                    the identity and number of persons involved in the alleged offences. More
                    importantly, his evidence lacks specificity and detail as to the dates and times
                    on which the alleged thefts took place and as to what items were stolen. While
                    this is a case concerning joint criminal liability under s 34 of the Penal
                    Code, it is nevertheless necessary to prove that the offence was actually
                    committed on the dates and times stated in the charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the present case, there is no evidence that
                    Geyabalan or any of the three other accomplices had, on the specific dates
                    stated in the four theft charges, taken the specific items of jewellery from
                    passengers’ baggage in furtherance of a common intention. Moreover, the
                    trial judge apparently did not consider the possibility that the thefts could
                    have been committed by either the airport staff or airline staff who had taken
                    the bags from the passengers to be checked in (see [45] above), or the
                    additional workers which PW9 himself agreed would often be assigned to
                    India-bound flights to help with the loading of the luggage. I therefore find
                    that the conviction of Geyabalan on the basis of PW9’s testimony is unsafe
                    and that the Prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
                    Geyabalan had committed the offences in the four theft charges preferred against
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The above observations in relation to
                    PW9’s testimony apply equally when considering Nagas’ conviction. In
                    the case of Nagas, unlike Geyabalan, the evidence of the Complainants as well as
                    the records from the Pawnshop form additional planks of evidence against him.
                    However, as I have found, the evidence of the Complainants is neither here nor
                    there. In totality, the evidence cannot be said to have established beyond a
                    reasonable doubt that the jewellery lost by the Complainants had been pawned by
                    Nagas or was at any time in his possession. Even taking the evidence of the
                    Complainants together with PW9’s evidence and the documentary evidence,
                    such as the attendance records and the records from the Pawnshop, the evidence
                    does not “inevitably and inexorably" lead the court to the single
                    conclusion of Nagas’ guilt: see <em>Ang Sunny v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [1965-1967] SLR(R) 123 at [14].
                    Nagas’ convictions on the four theft charges should therefore also be
                    overturned. It follows that is unnecessary for me to consider Nagas’
                    appeal against his sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In my view, undue weight was placed by the
                    trial judge on the evidence of PW9 that the Appellants were involved in the
                    alleged thefts, and the evidence of the Complainants that the jewellery they had
                    identified was indeed theirs. These are crucial aspects of the
                    Prosecution’s case. However, the evidence in these respects is unreliable
                    and inadequate to support the trial judge’s findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Moreover, the trial judge did not consider the
                    evidence in respect of each of the Appellants separately, and did not examine
                    the individual particulars of the charges against the Appellants to ensure that
                    they were made out on the available evidence. In doing so, the trial judge had
                    adopted an overly broad-brush approach towards the assessment of the
                    Prosecution’s evidence. In the result, with respect, the findings are
                    against the weight of the evidence and the convictions are unsafe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It bears reiterating that the Prosecution
                    bears the burden of proving its case against the Appellants beyond a reasonable
                    doubt. In my judgment, the Prosecution has not discharged that burden in the
                    present case. For all the reasons above, the Appellants’ appeals against
                    their respective convictions are allowed.</p>
