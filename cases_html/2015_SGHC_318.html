<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In an adjudication determination dated
                    25 June 2015, as amended on 29 June 2015 (“the
                    AD”), the adjudicator determined that the respondent was liable to pay
                    the claimant a sum of $1,540,331.70 pursuant to a payment claim under a
                    construction sub-contract (“the Contract”). On
                    14 July 2015 the applicant obtained leave of court to enforce the AD
                    pursuant to s 27(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of
                    Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). On
                    28 July 2015, the respondent filed this summons no 3658 of 2015
                    (“SUM 3658/2015”) to set aside the AD. On
                    2 October 2015, after hearing counsel for the parties, I dismissed the
                    respondent’s application. I now give the grounds for my
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The respondent’s application was made on
                    the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     The adjudication application was
                        filed prematurely.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     The application was invalid as it did not contain all the information
                        prescribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I shall deal with each ground
                        in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Adjudication application filed prematurely</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Under the first ground the issue turns on
                    whether the expression “calendar day” used in the Contract
                    includes or excludes public holidays. 3 April 2015 was the Good Friday
                    public holiday in Singapore and this fell between the service of the payment
                    claim and provision of the payment response. A determination one way or another
                    would determine the issue in favour of the applicant or the
                respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The following are the relevant facts. The
                    applicant (as claimant) served the payment claim on 1 April 2015, in
                    accordance with the Contract. The respondent provided its payment response on
                    21 April 2015. On 28 April 2015, the applicant filed a
                    notice of intention to apply for adjudication pursuant to s 13(2) of the
                    Act. And on 30 April 2015, the applicant filed the adjudication
                    application pursuant to s 13(1) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The respondent submitted that the adjudication
                    application was filed prematurely on 30 April 2015 because the
                    earliest that it could be filed was the following day, 1 May 2015. The
                    respondent’s argument was as follows. Clause 2.3 of the Contract makes the
                    following provision in relation to the period within which the payment response
                    is to be provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Within 21 calendar days of receipt of the progress claim, the [respondent]
                        will issue to the [applicant], a Payment Response Certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The respondent submitted that the term
                    “calendar days” in this clause excludes public holidays. If that
                    were the case, then the deadline to provide the payment response would be 23
                    April as 3 April was a public holiday. Under s 12(2) of the Act, the
                    applicant is entitled to make an adjudication application after the end of the
                    dispute settlement period (“DSP”). The DSP is defined in
                    s 12(5) as “the period of 7 days after the date on which or the
                    period within which the payment response is required to be provided under
                    section 11(1)”. Following the holding in <em>Tienrui
                        Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd v G &amp; Y Trading and Manufacturing Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2015] 5 SLR 852 (“<em>Tienrui</em>”) that the DSP runs from the date on which the
                    payment response is required to be provided (and not on the date that the
                    payment response is actually provided), this means that the earliest date that
                    the applicant was entitled to make a payment claim is 1 May 2015,
                    after the 7-day period between this date and
                23 April 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The applicant, on the other hand, contended that
                    the expression “calendar days” is not affected by any public
                    holiday that may fall within that period. Accordingly the deadline for the
                    payment response was 22 April 2015 and, after the 7-day DSP, the
                    earliest date on which the applicant was entitled to file an adjudication
                    application was 30 April 2015, which was the actual date that it was
                    filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       “Day” is defined in s 2 of
                    the Act as “any day other than a public holiday within the meaning of the
                    Holidays Act (Cap 126)”. However the Contract used the term
                    “calendar days” and the question is whether this bears the same
                    meaning as the word “day” in the Act. The term “calendar
                    day” is not defined in the Contract; instead it contains the following
                    definition of “day”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless specifically stated otherwise, “day(s)” mean(s)
                        Gregorian calendar day(s) and “month(s)” mean(s) Gregorian
                        calendar month(s).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The respondent also pointed out that
                    Black’s Law Dictionary (6th Ed,1990) defines “calendar days”
                    in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A calendar day contains 24 hours; but “calendar days” may be
                        synonymous with “working days”. <em>Sherwood v
                            American Sugar Refining Co, C.C. A.N.Y., 8 F.2d 586, 588</em>. The
                        time from midnight to midnight. <em>LANNI v Grimes, 173 Misc.
                            614, 18 N.Y.S.2d 322, 327</em>. So many days reckoned according to
                        the course of the calendar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is clear that none of these definitions is
                    of any help in this matter. While the word “day” is defined in the
                    Act, that definition is meant to apply to that word wherever it is found in the
                    Act. There is nothing in the Act compelling the use of that definition in any
                    construction contract although parties are free to adopt such definitions by
                    express provision. In appropriate circumstances, in interpreting a construction
                    (or supply) contract the payment terms of which falls within the purview of the
                    Act, it could be possible to hold that the same interpretation was meant in the
                    contract. But this depends on the circumstances. The respondent submitted that
                    it was appropriate to do it in the present case. If the term concerned was
                    “day”, I would have little hesitation to do so. Unfortunately for
                    the respondent it is not. Instead, the Contract uses “calendar
                    day”. The counter-submission advanced by the applicant was that there
                    must have been a reason for the use of a different term in the Contract. The
                    applicant submitted that the reason was because the Contract intended a
                    different concept for “calendar day” compared to
                    “day”
                    <em>simpliciter</em>, and this was that public holidays
                    would also be counted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     
          <em>Woo Kah Wai and another v
                        Chew Ai Hua Sandra</em> [2014] 4 SLR 166 concerned an option for the
                    purchase of property in which the deadline was expressed to be “3
                    days”. The Court of Appeal considered that this could mean either
                    “three calendar days or three working days”. Implicit in this
                    statement is that the expression “calendar days” included public
                    holidays and weekends as this was used in comparison with “working
                    days”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In my opinion, the applicant’s position
                    is the correct one. The expression “calendar day” contains the
                    notion that it includes every day of the calendar as opposed to, say
                    “working day” or “weekday”. The drafter of the
                    Contract may be presumed to have used this term in order to denote a different
                    way of measuring time from how it is contemplated in the Act which uses the word
                    “day” and contains a definition for it. If he had intended to do
                    it in the same manner then there would not be any need to add an extra word,
                    “calendar”, to qualify “day”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Even if I had any doubt on the intention
                    behind “calendar day” and were to hold that the term is ambiguous,
                    the outcome would be the same. In <em>Tienrui</em>, it was
                    held that in an appropriate case, the court would interpret any provision
                        <em>contra proferentem</em> – see <em>Tienrui</em> at [54]. In the present case the Contract was
                    drafted by the respondent. There is no reason in the circumstances of this case
                    to prefer the respondent’s position to that of the
                applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Adjudication application invalid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Under s 13(3)(<em>c</em>) of the Act, an adjudication application “shall contain

                    Industry Security of Payment Regulations (Cap 30B, Rg 1, 2006 Rev
                    Ed)(“the Regulations”) in which reg 7(2) provides as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The respondent’s complaint pertains to
                        reg 7(2)(<em>d</em>). The respondent submitted
                    that the applicant’s adjudication application (“the AA”) did
                    not contain an extract of <em><u>all</u></em> the terms and
                    conditions of the contract that are relevant to the payment claim dispute. In
                    particular, the respondent asserted that the AA should have included the
                    following documents which were missing from it:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Standard Conditions of Nominated
                        Sub-Contractor 2008 for use in conjunction with the Public Sector Standard

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     According to the respondent the AA was
                    therefore invalid as it was in breach of s 13(3)(<em>c</em>) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The applicant asserted that it had complied
                    with the requirement in reg 7(2)(<em>d</em>) of the
                    Regulations as it had included in the AA the complete contract (which is
                    entitled “Subcontract Agreement”) which, it claimed, had more than
                    met the prescribed requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The respondent had made the same objection to
                    the adjudicator who was not impressed. The adjudicator stated in the AD that
                    “the inquiry must be whether the document is relevant to the approach
                    taken by the Claimant in making the payment claim” and he felt that the
                    documents provided were adequate for this purpose. It should be noted that the
                    respondent did not allege that it had been prejudiced or embarrassed in any way
                    on account of the breach. The only basis for complaint was that
                        s 13(3)(<em>c</em>) was a mandatory requirement
                    and the applicant had failed to comply with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In Chow Kok Fong, <em>Security
                        of Payments and Construction Adjudication</em> (LexisNexis 2nd Ed,
                    2013) the learned author observed at [9.68]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There have been several instances where the validity of an adjudication
                        application has been challenged on the ground that the application fails to
                        include all the relevant terms and conditions of the underlying contract as
                        required by regulation 7(2)(d). Adjudicators have generally considered such
                        an objection to be unduly technical, particularly where it is considered
                        that, notwithstanding the omission of certain terms from the extracts, the
                        respondent has not been prejudiced. It has been suggested that the test is
                        whether, on the extracts of the documents as furnished, the respondent
                        understands the case he has to meet and is afforded a basis to formulate his
                        case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I would endorse the pragmatic approach taken
                    by those adjudicators. Not all provisions are of such fundamental importance
                    that a breach would invalidate the process – see <em>Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v A Pacific Construction &amp;
                        Development Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 2 SLR 776 at [29]-[32]. The present
                    provision is certainly not a requirement of such importance that any breach
                    would render the application invalid. If I were to hold otherwise, the
                    potentially large quantities of documents and other information that the general
                    words in the regulation could encompass would engender endless applications for
                    invalidation and cripple the operation of the Act. It must be borne in mind that
                    this pertains to a claimant’s application. If the respondent is prejudiced
                    because the claimant has failed to provide any document, the respondent may make
                    an application to the adjudicator for that document. This will invariably delay
                    the process, which is to the claimant’s detriment. Any additional costs
                    incurred by the respondent due to delay caused by the claimant can be
                    compensated by way of an appropriate costs order. I see no reason why any
                    claimant would not be diligent in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     There is therefore absolutely no reason for
                    the view that breach of reg 7(2)(d) is fundamental and goes to the validity
                    of the adjudication application. If, on a respondent’s application, the
                    adjudicator considers that that any prescribed document or information is not
                    provided, he may order the claimant to provide it. If he feels that the
                    respondent is entitled to costs or to an adjournment or both, he may make the
                    necessary orders. In this manner the adjudication process can proceed without
                    undue delay from unnecessary challenges on validity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For the reasons given above, I dismissed the
                    respondent’s application to set aside the AD.</p>
