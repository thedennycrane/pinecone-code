Another guiding principle is that one must look to the substance – rather than merely the form – of the proceedings concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In an application for the transfer of an appeal from the Appellate Division of the High Court (“AD”) to the Court of Appeal, the “overarching inquiry” is whether it is more appropriate for the Court of Appeal to hear the appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Noor </span><span class="font-italic">Azlin bte Abdul Rahman and another v Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 2 SLR 440 (“<span class="font-italic">Noor </span><span class="font-italic">Azlin</span>”) at [45]). The present application is one such application. The applicant, who seeks remuneration for work done in relation to legal disputes which his clients were involved in, argues that legal issues raised by his appeal against the judgment of the General Division of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Choo Cheng Tong Wilfred v </span><span class="font-italic">Phua Swee Khiang and another </span>[2021] SGHC 154 would be more appropriately heard by the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In support of his application, the applicant raises numerous arguments pursuant to the matters set out in O 56A r 12(3), read with O 56A r 12(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) and s 29D(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(ii) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). However, at bottom, his case really concerns the <span class="font-italic">interpretation as well as application</span> of certain provisions of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Act”). The fundamental issue he raises relates to what constitutes acting “as an advocate and solicitor” within the meaning of the Act. At trial, the judge, applying the tests in <span class="font-italic">Turner (East Asia) Pte Ltd v Builders Federal (Hong Kong) Ltd and another</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1988] 1 SLR(R) 281 (“<span class="font-italic">Turner</span>”), found that the applicant’s work consisted of acting “as an advocate and solicitor” within the meaning of the Act; therefore, he was barred by the Act from claiming remuneration for any such work done while he was an unauthorised person within the meaning of the Act. The applicant now argues, amongst other ancillary issues relating to the interpretation and application of the Act, that the judge had erred by applying the tests in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>, and that a new understanding of what constitutes acting “as an advocate and solicitor” should be fashioned from developments in <span class="font-italic">other jurisdictions</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 It is important at this juncture to draw a distinction between what the existing law <span class="font-italic">is </span>and what the law <span class="font-italic">ought </span>to be. What the existing law <span class="font-italic">is </span>is well-established: see <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>. The applicant identifies <span class="font-italic">Turner </span>as a decision of some age, but age is a neutral point; indeed, there are many established decisions that are of very considerable vintage and which often constitute the foundation in relation to their respective areas of the law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The applicant sets his sights higher, and pitches his arguments in the realm of what the law <span class="font-italic">ought </span>to be. However, in general, in an area governed principally by legislation, any submission that the law ought to be different must be effected with regard to the proper interpretation of that legislation, bearing in mind the existing case law. As I have just observed, the principles governing the relevant provisions of the Act were established in <span class="font-italic">Turner</span>. The applicant has not pointed to any amendments to the Act since which warrant a further examination of those principles. The applicant’s case is based instead solely on developments in <span class="font-italic">other jurisdictions</span>, in which different legislation prevails. The reform in the law which the applicant is arguing for therefore engages <span class="font-italic">policy </span>issues that are more appropriately within the purview of <span class="font-italic">the Legislature</span>, and not the courts (whether the AD or the Court of Appeal).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 What is left then of the issues raised by the applicant concerns primarily the <span class="font-italic">application and interpretation </span>of <span class="font-italic">well-established </span>law. These are areas for which the <span class="font-italic">AD</span> is <span class="font-italic">quintessentially </span>the appropriate forum, and where <span class="font-italic">it is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> <span class="font-italic">more appropriate for the Court of Appeal to hear the appeal</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Bearing this fundamental point in mind, I turn now to deal with the specific arguments raised by the applicant pursuant to the various grounds set out under O 56A r 12(3) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 First, the applicant suggests that the appellate court’s holdings as to the interpretation and the application of the Act would affect all manner of people with some form of learning of the law (but do not hold practising certificates) who wish to apply their multi-disciplinary skills across a wide range of industries, as well as anyone who would hire such people. He submits that his appeal therefore engages both O 56A rr 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that his appeal relates to a matter of national or public importance and/or raises a point of law of public importance. However, as pointed out by the respondents, this demographic identified by the applicant comprises only a small segment of society. Nor is it apparent that this small segment of society has an outsized role to play, such that a decision delineating the fine edges of what they can and cannot do will have the potential to impact Singapore on a macro-level, as this court put it in <span class="font-italic">Noor </span><span class="font-italic">Azlin</span> at [49]. Further, as already highlighted above, the points of law involved in the applicant’s appeal are more appropriately dealt with by the AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Next, the applicant invokes O 56A r 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the ROC, arguing that his appeal is both factually and legally novel and complex. However, the Appellant’s Case he has filed indicates that the factual scope of his case has been dramatically reduced on appeal. Nor does this matter disclose any particular degree of legal complexity. This appeal therefore does not satisfy the requirement that “both <span class="font-italic">complexity </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">novelty </span>must be present” (see <span class="font-italic">Noor </span><span class="font-italic">Azlin </span>at [67] [emphasis in original]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Third, the applicant argues that there are conflicting judicial decisions, and that O 56A r 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the ROC is therefore satisfied. The conflicting judicial decisions he speaks of are simply <span class="font-italic">Turner</span> on the one hand and certain English authorities on the other. However, the mere fact that the courts in Singapore have taken a different approach on a particular issue as compared to other jurisdictions cannot be taken to satisfy O 56A r 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the ROC. There is probably no legal issue on which every single court in the world agrees. A dedicated enough appellant would most likely be able to find a case differing from Singaporean jurisprudence on virtually any issue. If this were to be taken as sufficient, O 56A r 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the ROC would be deprived of meaning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Finally, the applicant submits that, <span class="font-italic">per </span>O 56A r 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the ROC, the results of his appeal are significant, both generally (in respect of which he repeats his arguments in relation to O 56A rr 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC) and personally. I have already addressed those arguments made in relation to O 56A rr 12(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, and so I turn to the issue of personal significance. This court observed in <span class="font-italic">Noor </span><span class="font-italic">Azlin </span>at [73] that “a high and exceptional degree of personal consequence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, substantial and critical) would have to be demonstrated for the matter to even be considered as potentially coming within the rule”. The only personal consequence cited by the applicant is that the Judge’s finding paves the way for him to be prosecuted under s 33 of the Act. Without more, I do not consider that even a successful prosecution would bring the applicant beyond the threshold outlined in <span class="font-italic">Noor </span><span class="font-italic">Azlin</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In short, the issues raised in the appeal which the applicant has highlighted for this application concern simply the interpretation and application of the Act. There are no other facets of the appeal which surmount this fundamental observation. The appeal is more appropriately heard in the AD, and I dismiss this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Each party is to bear their own costs for this application. This is in accordance with an agreement between the parties, whereby the respondents agreed not to object to the application. The first respondent submits that that agreement was made before the court called for written submissions; having incurred costs in the preparation of his submissions, which would not have been incurred but for this application, he is entitled to those costs. I note, however, that the first respondent had acknowledged (correctly, in my view) that he would be duty-bound to address the court on his position and that that acknowledgment formed part of the above agreement. Significantly, the second respondent acknowledged in its written submissions to the court that, in accordance with the above agreement, each party was to bear their own costs for the present application. The usual consequential orders apply.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Salem bin Mohamed Ibrahim, Charlene Wee Swee Ting and<br/>Hoon Wei Yang Benedict (Salem Ibrahim LLC) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Wai Kit Darren Dominic and Ng Yi Ming Daniel <br/>(Characterist LLC) for the first respondent;<br/>Chow Chao Wu Jansen, Ang Leong Hao and Sasha Gonsalves (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the second respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
