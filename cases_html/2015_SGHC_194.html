<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The wife commenced these proceedings on 27
                    January 2011 seeking divorce on grounds of the husband’s unreasonable
                    behaviour. The husband initially defended the proceedings but withdrew his
                    defence in exchange for the wife’s agreement to remove by amendment
                    certain allegations in her statement of particulars. The wife amended her
                    particulars as agreed and secured an uncontested interim judgment on 25 October
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I now have to determine the ancillary matters.
                    They comprise: (i) division of the parties’ matrimonial assets; (ii)
                    maintenance for the wife and for the triplets; and (iii) custody of and access
                    to the triplets. No issue arises as to care and control of the triplets: it is
                    common ground that their care and control should rest with the
                wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Having considered all of the evidence and
                    submissions, I have decided:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     That a just and equitable division of
                        the matrimonial assets is to award 60% to the wife and 40% to the
                        husband;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
                        the wife should receive no maintenance for herself but shall be given
                        liberty to apply in the future for maintenance if circumstances
                        change;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     That the
                        husband shall pay lump sum maintenance to the wife for the triplets which I
                        have fixed at a little over $325,000, to be paid to the wife out of the
                        husband’s share of matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     That the wife shall have sole custody of the
                        triplets; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_e"></a>(e)     That the husband shall have only supervised access to the triplets, limited
                        to two hours a week.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The husband has appealed against my decision. I
                    now give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The history of the marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The husband and the wife married on 9 April
                    1996. Soon after they married, the husband invited the wife to join his
                    family’s packaging business. She did so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The husband and wife subsequently left the
                    husband’s family’s business and set up their own sole proprietorship
                    known as [P]. They subsequently transferred ownership of [P] to a company known
                    as [Q] Pte Ltd. The husband and the wife each control 50% of the shares in [Q]
                    Pte Ltd, but the husband is the sole director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In addition to carrying on business in
                    its own right, [Q] Pte Ltd was also the holding company for the couple’s
                    other businesses which included a piano shop and a spa.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">April 2009 – the husband discloses his homosexuality to the
                wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Sometime in 2008, the wife noticed that the
                    husband was acting odd and had withdrawn from the family. He would go out alone
                    and return home drunk, late at night. He began sleeping separately from the
                        wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The wife was concerned about the change in the
                    husband’s behaviour. In January 2009, she engaged a private investigator
                    to conduct surveillance on the husband. The investigator’s report revealed
                    that, unknown completely to the wife, the husband was actively and promiscuously
                    pursuing homosexual liaisons. The wife confronted the husband with the evidence.
                    He revealed that he was homosexual and admitted that he was engaging in
                    homosexual liaisons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The wife and the husband agreed to undergo
                    counselling in order to try to save their marriage. In April 2009, at the first
                    counselling session, the husband disclosed to the wife that he was HIV
                        positive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       From the last quarter of 2009, the husband began
                    spending weekends and other stretches of a few days away from his wife and
                    family. He did so without informing the wife where he was or what he was doing
                    during these absences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    The husband’s conduct naturally caused the wife distress.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">January 2010 – the wife moves out of the matrimonial
                home</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In January 2010, the wife concluded that the
                    husband was not serious about trying to salvage their marriage. She moved out of
                    the matrimonial home in Sembawang, taking the triplets with her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">February 2010 – personal protection order </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In February 2010, the wife sought a personal
                    protection order against the husband to restrain the husband from committing
                    family violence on her and on the triplets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The wife’s application was based on three
                    grounds: (i) battery committed by the husband on the wife in March 2004 and
                    in February 2010; (ii) the husband’s use of physical force on one of the
                    triplets in May 2010;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and (iii) the
                    husband’s screaming rages against the other two of the triplets which had
                    put them in serious fear of him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 24 February 2010, the wife secured an
                    expedited order under s 66 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“Women’s Charter”) restraining the husband from committing
                    family violence on her and on the triplets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> The personal protection proceedings then
                    went on to a full hearing which took place in October 2010. Witnesses on both
                    sides were examined and cross-examined. The wife relied on her own evidence. She
                    also relied on the evidence of four of her colleagues. They all gave evidence of
                    the husband’s battery of the wife in February 2010. The battery took place
                    at the parties’ workplace in Serangoon, at a time when she had already
                    left the matrimonial home. On that day, the wife returned to the workplace
                    against the husband’s wishes. The husband attempted to remove her by
                    force, in the presence of several others including the four colleagues who gave
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The husband’s battery of the wife was
                    real in that the husband applied physical force to the wife’s person
                    without her consent. It was not, however, serious in that it did not cause the
                    wife serious physical injuries. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that she was
                    distressed by the battery and deeply humiliated by the circumstances in which it
                    took place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The husband all but admitted his battery. In
                    his written submission to the District Judge – written personally by the
                    husband as he was then, as now, acting in person – the husband explained
                    that he had been provoked.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The husband’s explanation to the
                    District Judge, in words unmediated by a lawyer, is as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the occurrence …happened naturally as a result of the
                        necessity to enforce order in the discharge of office and family duty. As
                        head of the family, submission is expected in those 2 situations when the
                        incidence [<em>sic</em>] [of force used against the
                        wife] occurred. And as head of family business, it is difficult to accept
                        public display of insubordination or challenge of command and control. It
                        would not be practical to always enlist the assistance of police to vacate a
                        family member to settle domestic [and] business affairs which are also
                        domestic in nature for affairs relating [to] husband and wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     To support her case in the personal protection
                    proceedings, the wife relied also on the evidence of the triplets. But to spare
                    them the trauma of cross-examination, she invited the District Judge to speak to
                    the triplets in chambers. At the husband’s insistence, however, the
                    triplets were compelled to give evidence formally and were subjected to the
                    ordeal of cross-examination, albeit by video-link. The husband was, as I have
                    said, acting in person in the personal protection proceedings. His decision
                    therefore deliberately put his young children in a position where they would
                    have to be subjected to cross-examination by their own father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After hearing all the evidence, the District
                    Judge granted the wife a personal protection order against the
                        husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    The District Judge, however, declined to grant the triplets a personal
                    protection order against the husband. He held that such an order was not
                    necessary for their protection within the meaning of s 65 of the
                    Women’s Charter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The factual basis for an
                    order protecting the children, however, was largely undisputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The District Judge also ordered the husband to
                    pay to the wife the costs of the personal protection proceedings fixed at
                        $15,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The husband has yet to
                    pay these costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">March 2010 – the wife sets up her own business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In March 2010, after leaving the matrimonial
                    home, the wife set up her own business known as [R] Pte Ltd. This is a company
                    with a paid up share capital of $100,000 out of which the wife owns 99,000
                    shares of $1 each. [R] Pte Ltd is in the business of packaging
                    activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">June 2010 – the wife applies for custody of the
                triplets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After the wife left the matrimonial home in
                    January 2010 with the triplets, she allowed the husband to continue to have
                    access to the triplets. In June 2010, however, the wife applied under the
                    Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed) for sole custody, care and
                    control of the triplets, with the husband to have only supervised and limited
                    access. She relied on two grounds to support her application. First, she relied
                    on the same history of family violence against herself and the triplets that she
                    had relied on in the personal protection proceedings. Second, she relied on the
                    fact that the husband was in an intimate homosexual relationship with another
                    man and that the two men had slept together on the same bed with the triplets
                    while the triplets were in the husband’s care and control.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Having heard the parties’ submissions,
                    the District Judge ordered that the wife have sole custody, care and control of
                    the triplets with supervised access to the husband and no overnight access. The
                    order fixed the husband’s access for two hours a week: on Saturdays from
                    12.00 noon to 2.00 pm at Woodlands Civic Centre.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The District Judge also ordered the husband to
                    pay to the wife the costs of the custody proceedings fixed at
                        $14,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The husband has yet to
                    pay these costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">2011 – the husband is charged under the Misuse of Drugs
                Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In 2011, the husband was charged with five
                    offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). Two of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In November 2012, the husband was adjudicated
                    a bankrupt on the application of the United Overseas Bank Ltd. The debt arose
                    from the husband’s liability as a guarantor for a loan taken out by one of
                    the couple’s businesses to purchase a car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>

                    below. My conclusion there is that, on the facts of this case, the

                    to divide in a just and equitable manner the couple’s matrimonial assets.
                    I therefore now consider what such a division would entail.</p>

                        this account, the parties are to divide the funds between themselves in the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The court’s duty under s 112 of the
                    Women’s Charter is to divide the parties’ matrimonial assets
                    “in such proportion as the court thinks just and
                    equitable”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Court of Appeal in <em>BCB
                        v BCC</em> [2013] 2 SLR 324 (“<em>BCB</em>”) set out the following principles which I bear in
                    mind:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     It is fundamental to the proper
                        exercise of the power under s 112 of the Women’s Charter that the
                        court use a broad-brush approach (at [7]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     It is wrong in principle to emphasise unduly or
                        to focus inordinately on each spouse’s direct contributions (at [8]).
                        That is only one of the many factors to be considered as part of all the
                        circumstances of the case in exercising the power to arrive at the just and
                        equitable division mandated by s 112(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     The court should not adopt the approach taken
                        under the predecessor of s 112 by treating the spouses’ direct
                        contributions as the starting point for a just and equitable division, and
                        then making adjustments to account for the spouses’ non-financial
                        contributions (at [9]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a>(d)     The modern broad-brush approach ensures that the division
                        arrived at by the court gives effect to the important principle that the
                        court must take fully into account all indirect contributions of every type
                        (at [11]) and made by each spouse (at [12] and [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Court of Appeal has more recently made
                    more explicitly the break with the previous approach to the division of
                    matrimonial assets. In its very recent decision in <em>ANJ v
                        ANK</em> [2015] SGCA 34 (“<em>ANJ</em>”), the Court of Appeal cautioned – once again
                    – against the approach of taking the parties’ direct contributions
                    as the starting point and adding an uplift to account for their respective
                    indirect contributions. Adopting that approach carries the risk both of
                    undervaluing and of overvaluing non-financial contributions: <em>ANJ</em> at [19] and [20]. Both outcomes are contrary to the duty
                    under s 112 of the Women’s Charter to arrive at a just and equitable
                    division of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Court of Appeal suggested instead adopting
                    the following structured four-step approach (at [22] to [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, derive a ratio which
                        represents the relationship between the direct financial contributions of
                        each party towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets.
                        Where all necessary evidence is available, this is an arithmetical exercise.
                        Where all necessary evidence is not available, the court must use a broad
                        brush to make approximations based on the available documentary evidence and
                        on the parties’ own evidence assessed in the light of their
                        veracity.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     Next,
                        derive a second ratio which represents the relationship between the
                        non-financial and indirect financial contributions of each party towards the
                        welfare of the family. This is necessarily a matter of impression and
                        judgment to be approached in broad strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     Then, average the two ratios to derive each
                        party’s overall contribution to the family. This average forms the
                        basis for the division of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finally, make any adjustments which
                        are necessary to arrive at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial
                        assets. The necessary adjustment can be made either by increasing or
                        decreasing the average ratio derived in the third step or by attaching
                        greater weight to one of the component ratios derived in the first step or
                        the second step. The adjustment in this final step is a qualitative
                        adjustment based on the court’s sense of what is fair and just. It is
                        made to recognise that, in certain cases and on certain facts, one type of
                        contribution may carry greater importance than the other. It is also the
                        opportunity to take into account all the circumstances of the case as well
                        as the factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the Women's Charter other than in
                            s 112(2)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>d</em>).</p>

                    decision which was handed down by the Court of Appeal after I had made my
                    decision in this case. I do not, however, see any impediment to my explaining my
                    reasons for my decision by adopting the structured four step approach set out in
                    it. First, that approach approximates the approach which I actually applied in
                    arriving at my decision. Second, although <em>ANJ</em>’s structured four-step approach is new, the policy,
                    principle and precedent underlying it is not new. <em>ANJ</em> is entirely consistent with the case law which precedes it
                    and, in particular, with the principles which I have distilled from <em>BCB</em> and set out above, all of which I applied in
                    arriving at my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Applying the approach set out in <em>BCB</em> and in <em>ANJ</em>, it is my
                    view that it would be just and equitable to divide the matrimonial assets so as
                    to award the wife 60% and to award the husband 40%. I arrive at this decision
                    for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Direct contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Section 112(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter provides that one of the
                    circumstances of the case which a court has a duty to have regard to in arriving
                    at a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets is “the extent of
                    the contributions made by each party in money, property or work toward
                    acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial
                assets”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I start by attributing to each spouse, as that
                    spouse’s direct contributions, the full value of the assets held in that
                    spouse’s name. It therefore remains only for me to assess each
                    spouse’s direct contributions to the jointly-owned matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Having attributed a nil value to the
                    parties’ joint OCBC account (see [28(c)] above), there are only two
                    jointly-owned matrimonial assets which I need to analyse:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     The fund of $298,491.94 held by the
                        law firm of Mallal &amp; Namazie representing the net proceeds of sale of
                        the matrimonial home in Sembawang; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     The property in Serangoon owned jointly by the two
                        spouses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In order to assess each spouse’s direct
                    contributions to the Sembawang property, it is necessary to start the analysis
                    with the couple’s first matrimonial home: an HDB flat in Jalan
                    Bahagia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Jalan Bahagia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The flat in Jalan Bahagia was purchased for
                    $227,000 in 1995<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> and sold for $550,000 in
                    late 1997 or early 1998.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> The husband’s
                    account of the acquisition and sale of Jalan Bahagia is as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... we co-habited at a HDB flat at ... Jalan Bahagia ... which was bought
                        in the joint names of [my] mother and me. Upon our marriage in 1996, the
                        Plaintiff insisted on adding her name to the flat and I removed [my]
                        mother’s name from the flat as I was very much in love with [the
                        plaintiff]. The Plaintiff never contributed towards the purchase or
                        maintenance of the flat. Subsequently, the flat was sold and I purchased
                        [the Serangoon property] in 2003. I paid 20% of the purchase price in cash
                        and took a loan from Hong Leong Finance. The loan has been fully repaid by
                        me since 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The wife’s version is quite different.
                    She says as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    ... I wish to say that upon our marriage, we lived
                            and cohabited first at ... Jalan Bahagia ... Singapore (“the HDB
                            flat”) and thereafter at the matrimonial home [in Sembawang]. The
                            Defendant...volunteered to include me as joint owner of the HDB flat
                            upon our marriage; accordingly contrary to the Defendant’s claim,
                            I did not insist on the inclusion of my name as joint owner of the HDB
                            flat. Copies of the Transfer and the title search on the HDB flat
                            exhibited at pages 40 to 47 of this Affidavit directly contradicts
                                [<em>sic</em>] the Defendant’s claim that
                            the HDB flat was bought in the joint names of his mother and himself.
                            The title search in fact shows that the HDB flat was purchased by the
                            Defendant in his sole name sometime in or about April 1994 with the
                            transfer to his sole name being registered on 21 June 1995. Following
                            our marriage on 9 April 1996, the Defendant voluntarily and of his own
                            free will on 4 June 1997 transferred the HDB flat in his sole name to
                            our joint names as joint tenants, the transfer to me being by way of
                            gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    The aforesaid title search further shows that the
                            HDB flat was sold sometime at the end of 1997 or the beginning of 1998.
                            Further ... the Defendant allude to the fact that the proceed [<em>sic</em>] from the sale of the HDB flat was utilised
                            towards payment of 20% of the purchase price for [the Serangoon
                            property]. This cannot be true bearing in mind that the HDB flat was
                            sold way back at the end of 1997 or the beginning of 1998 whereas [the
                            Serangoon property] was purchased some 5 or 6 years later in 2003
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On every contentious point in these two
                    accounts of the relevant events, the wife’s account is amply supported by
                    contemporaneous and independent documentary evidence while the husband’s
                    account is based solely on his word. Indeed, the husband’s account of
                    these events is so devoid of evidential support and is so diametrically
                    inconsistent with the contemporaneous and independent documentary evidence
                    produced by the wife that I am driven to the conclusion that the husband is
                    either a self-deluded fantasist or an unabashed liar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I therefore have no hesitation in accepting
                    the wife’s account in relation to Jalan Bahagia. The consequences are
                    twofold. First, I find that the husband voluntarily made a gift to the wife of
                    an equal interest in Jalan Bahagia before it was sold. Indeed, his intention to
                    make a gift to her is expressly recorded in the endorsement of the transfer from
                    his sole name to their joint names on the land register.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Second, I find that the wife’s
                    half-interest in Jalan Bahagia translates into a direct contribution by the wife
                    towards the acquisition of the Sembawang property which is equal to the
                    husband’s direct contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sembawang property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Sembawang property was purchased in 1997
                    for $1.68m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> It was
                    purchased with three co-owners holding the property as tenants in common in
                    equal shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The
                    three co-owners were the wife, the husband and the husband’s mother. The
                    property was sold in June 2011 for $2.3m by agreement of the three co-owners in
                    order to facilitate its division as a matrimonial asset, after accounting for
                    the husband’s mother’s interest in it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It is not disputed that the husband’s
                    mother paid $450,000 towards the purchase price of the Sembawang property and
                    the stamp duty payable upon the transfer. The remaining $1.23m of the purchase
                    price was financed by OCBC in three parts:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> (i) a bridging loan of $200,000; (ii) a
                    housing loan of $730,000; and (iii) an overdraft facility of
                $300,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The bridging loan of $200,000 was in due
                    course discharged using the proceeds of sale of Jalan Bahagia. The husband
                    submits that this sum of $200,000 should be attributed entirely to him as he was
                    the sole owner of Jalan Bahagia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> As I have found, that is not the true position:
                    the husband made a gift to the wife of a half-interest in Jalan Bahagia shortly
                    before it was sold. I therefore attribute this $200,000 direct contribution to
                    the acquisition of the Sembawang property equally to the husband and the
                    wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The husband’s and the wife’s
                    remaining direct contributions to the acquisition of the Sembawang property came
                    through monthly deductions from their respective CPF accounts to service the
                    housing loan from OCBC. In all, $300,082.40 was deducted from the
                    husband’s CPF account whereas $307,413.03<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> was deducted from the
                    wife’s CPF account. The cash component of each month’s instalment
                    was paid out of funds provided by the husband’s mother.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> Her evidence is that from 1997 to 2011,
                    she paid $280,413.01 to the husband which he used for this purpose.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     When the Sembawang property was sold in 2011,
                    the net proceeds of sale amounted to $928,008.36.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> The three co-owners agreed that the
                    husband’s mother’s share of the net proceeds of sale should be fixed
                    at $621,703.88<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>
                    and should be released to her. Separately, the husband and the wife agreed that
                    the sum remaining after releasing the agreed share to the husband’s mother
                    should be held by Mallal &amp; Namazie as stakeholders and be divided as a
                    matrimonial asset in these proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The sum released to the husband’s mother
                    as her share of the Sembawang property must be taken to represent the entirety
                    of her interest in that property arising not only from the $450,000 which she
                    paid at the time of acquisition but also from her contribution towards the stamp
                    duty and the sums she furnished to the husband to pay the cash portion of the
                    monthly instalments. The only direct contributions to the acquisition of the
                    Sembawang property which remain to be accounted for out of the sum held by
                    Mallal &amp; Namazie are therefore the direct contributions made by each spouse,
                    all of which came by way of deduction from each spouse’s CPF
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The stakeholding sum held by Mallal &amp;
                    Namazie was further reduced by a deduction of $13,118.91. That sum was a
                    deduction which Mallal &amp; Namazie was compelled to make from the net proceeds
                    of sale and to pay over to the Comptroller of Income Tax pursuant to
                    s 57(5A) of the Income Tax Act<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> in order to discharge the husband’s
                    unpaid liability for income tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The result is that the entirety of the
                    spouses’ joint interest in the Sembawang property is now represented by
                    the stakeholding sum of $298,491.94<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>
                    with Mallal &amp; Namazie. I have found that the husband has paid $400,082.40
                    towards the Sembawang property whereas the wife has paid $407,413.03 (see [49]
                    and [50] above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Taking the sum of those two figures as the
                    denominator, the husband’s and the wife’s direct contributions to
                    this property are therefore 49.55% and 50.45% respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Serangoon property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The spouses own the Serangoon property as
                    joint tenants on a 99-year lease which commenced on 28 June 1951 and expires on
                    27 June 2050.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> The husband
                    and wife conducted their businesses from these premises. From 2011, after the
                    Sembawang property was sold, the husband resided in the Serangoon property. This
                    property is by now unencumbered by a mortgage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The husband claims that he paid entirely for
                    the Serangoon property. He says:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As regards [the Serangoon property], although it was purchased in joint
                        names, it was financed entirely by me and the loan with Hong Leong Finance
                        has been fully settled since 2006, not 2007 as alleged. The mortgage
                        payments were paid by me by debiting my personal bank account. I am in the
                        process of procuring the bank statements to show the same and will disclose
                        the same in due course.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Once again, the wife’s account is quite
                    different. She says this:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is also untrue that [the Serangoon property] was paid for by the
                        Defendant. The truth as the Defendant well knew was that $450,000 being the
                        purchase price of [the Serangoon property] was paid as follows:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    Cash $90,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    Balance $360,000 was from Hong Leong Finance
                            Ltd’s mortgage loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The cash as well as the monthly mortgage was paid for by the Defendant and
                        I [<em>sic</em>] equally notwithstanding that in the
                        mortgage document, the Borrower was the Defendant and the Mortgagors were
                        the Defendant and I [<em>sic</em>] ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The mortgage on [the Serangoon property] was redeemed in May 2007 where
                        the Defendant issued a company’s ([Q] Pte Ltd where as would be
                        recalled, I owned and still own 50% of the share capital) DBS cheque for
                        $320,088.98 being the redemption sum. The aforesaid cheque was returned by

                        company’s cheque be issued for the said redemption. The Defendant
                        subsequently issued his UOB cheque for the said sum which I verily believe
                        was through monies credited by [Q] Pte Ltd via [Q] Pte Ltd’s DBS
                        cheque… dated 8 May 2007 for the said sum of $320,088.98. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As in the case of Jalan Bahagia and the
                    Sembawang property, the wife’s account on the Serangoon property is
                    supported by particulars and by contemporaneous and independent documentary
                    evidence. The husband’s account, yet again, is not. I therefore again have
                    no hesitation in accepting the wife’s account. I find that the parties
                    contributed equally to the acquisition of the Serangoon property and equally to
                    servicing the loan taken out to finance its acquisition.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I therefore hold that each spouse made a
                    direct contribution of 50% to the acquisition of the Serangoon
                property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on direct contributions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The result is that the wife’s direct
                    contribution to the total pool of matrimonial assets stands at 53.51% and the
                    husband’s direct contributions stands at 46.49%. I have arrived at those

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Section 112(2)(<em>d</em>) of the Women’s Charter provides that one of the
                    circumstances of the case which a court has a duty to have regard to in arriving
                    at a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets is “the extent of
                    the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including
                    looking after the home or caring for the family”. This provision covers
                    both non-financial contributions to the welfare of the family as well as
                    indirect financial contributions to the welfare of the family, <em>ie</em> financial contributions to the family’s welfare
                    which cannot be attributed to a tangible matrimonial asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Having considered all of the evidence and the
                    submissions, and applying broad strokes, I find that the wife has made
                    contributions to the welfare of the family which are equivalent to double those
                    of the husband’s contributions, <em>ie</em> in a 2:1
                    ratio in her favour. I have arrived at this finding for the following
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The wife’s indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The wife has been the primary caregiver of the
                    triplets since their birth.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> Her evidence is that she devoted all of her
                    free time and effort to raising the triplets, focusing on their physical,
                    emotional and academic needs and well-being.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> The husband attempts to
                    minimise her efforts by pointing out that the wife returned to work soon after
                    giving birth and left the care of the triplets to his mother and the
                    parties’ maids.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> It is true:
                    (i) that the wife returned to work after two months’ maternity leave;
                    (ii) that the couple had two maids until the triplets turned five years of age;
                    and (iii) that the husband’s mother lived with them in the matrimonial
                    home and assisted in supervising the maids and in childcare.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> But I accept the wife’s evidence
                    that she returned to work for the overall economic benefit of the family and
                    that, after she returned to work, any time which she did not spend on the family
                    business, she spent on looking after the triplets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Further, on the facts of this case, I allocate
                    the time which the husband’s mother spent on childcare to compensate for
                    the husband’s failure to contribute to childcare and not to reduce the
                    wife’s contribution to childcare.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I also attach importance to the fact that the
                    triplets were born through <em>in vitro</em> fertilisation.
                    Assisted reproduction techniques such as <em>in vitro</em>
                    fertilisation typically exact a high toll on the mother, physically, emotionally
                    and psychologically. That was the case here. The wife had to undergo many
                    stressful and painful procedures, several unsuccessful attempts and much anxiety
                    in trying to conceive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> I also take into account
                    the additional physical and psychological stress arising from a multiple
                    pregnancy. All of this has the effect of increasing the wife’s indirect
                    contributions as compared to the husband’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The husband’s indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(i)   Financial indirect contribution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The husband’s evidence is that he
                    provided amply for the financial needs of the family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> Although the wife disputes this, she
                    does so only in relation to the period after she left the matrimonial home with
                    the triplets in January 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> For the period from the birth of the triplets in
                    2003 until she left the matrimonial home, it is the wife’s own evidence
                    that the husband provided $14,000 every month to maintain the wife and the
                        triplets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> That is, by any
                    measure, a generous sum, sufficient to cater for all of the triplets’
                    material needs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In assessing the husband’s indirect
                    contributions, I therefore give him full credit for his substantial indirect
                    financial contribution. Unfortunately, this is virtually the husband’s
                    only indirect contribution to the welfare of the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(ii)   Lack of emotional support for wife and children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Although the wife’s statement of
                    particulars was amended by agreement,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> the
                    uncontested particulars of the husband’s unreasonable behaviour which
                    remain after amendment are serious. These uncontested particulars include the
                        following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     Throughout the marriage, the husband
                        displayed a foul temper against the wife and the
                    triplets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        husband treated the wife since 2004 with complete lack of affection and
                        without any consideration for her feelings or emotional
                    well-being;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        husband engaged in the behaviour set out at [6] and [9] above;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_d"></a>(d)     The husband
                        committed a battery on the wife in the circumstances set out at
                        [12]–[14] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(iii)   Decision to cut off financial support from January
                2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Further, the husband cut off all maintenance
                    for the wife and triplets after the wife left the matrimonial home with the
                        triplets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> He cancelled the
                    wife’s supplementary credit cards.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>
                    He did all this even though he remained under a legal obligation to maintain the
                    wife and triplets and even though his financial position at that time, in
                    January 2010, had not yet undergone any material change. I can only presume that
                    the husband acted out of vindictiveness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(iv)   Domineering nature</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The husband was, by all accounts, a
                    domineering husband. I rely for this finding on his own explanation of his
                    battery on the wife set out at [14] above. That extract, set in the
                    husband’s own words, shows an utter lack of self-awareness and of remorse
                    for his actions. The wife’s evidence is that this was his typical of
                    attitude throughout the marriage. As she says:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defendant was the dominant party in respect of both the marriage and
                        our businesses. Further, in respect of the business, although we were
                        supposed to be partners, the Defendant by his words and conduct always
                        treated me as a subordinate or staff much to my distress – the
                        Defendant having said to me on more than once that there can only be one
                        leader, referring to himself, and that I must give him complete or 100%
                        support, no question asked otherwise I am not a supportive wife. To please
                        the Defendant and so as not to jeopardise the marriage, I invariably gave in
                        to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(v)   Homosexuality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I do not count the husband’s sexual
                    orientation in itself against him in assessing his indirect contributions to the
                    welfare of the family. But there are, on the facts of this case, aspects of how
                    the husband has dealt with his homosexuality which I find to have detracted
                    significantly from the welfare of the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     First, the husband dishonestly concealed his
                    sexual orientation from the wife. I reject his evidence that he disclosed it to
                    her before their marriage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> The wife denies this allegation. Her evidence
                    is that she became aware of his sexual orientation for the first time after she
                    saw the private investigators’ reports in 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I accept the wife’s evidence. It is
                    consistent with the husband’s own conduct in the various litigation that
                    the parties have been involved in. In the personal protection proceedings
                    commenced by the wife in 2010, the husband deposed on oath that his homosexual
                    lover was just a friend. Further, the first time that the husband alleged that
                    the wife knew of his homosexuality before the marriage was in these proceedings,
                    and even then only at a late stage, on 27 March 2012. He had never asserted such
                    knowledge on the part of the wife during the earlier personal protection
                    proceedings or during the guardianship proceedings. In the latter proceedings,
                    that knowledge would have been a material fact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> Once again, I am unimpressed by the
                    husband’s capacity for truth-telling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Second, the wife has adduced evidence that the
                    husband leads a particularly dissolute and reckless lifestyle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> The wife has put in evidence a profile
                    posted by the husband on a website known as “Manjam”. Manjam
                    appears to be a social media platform catering to homosexuals. The
                    husband’s profile on Manjam includes a slide show of photographs of
                    himself clad only in his underwear accompanied by text in lurid terms soliciting
                    other male homosexuals for short-term sexual trysts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Significantly, the husband is dishonest in the
                    personal profile he has posted on this website. He gives his age dishonestly as
                    35 when he is in fact almost ten years older.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> He says dishonestly that he has no children when
                    in fact he is the father of triplets. Most importantly, he says dishonestly that
                    he is HIV negative when he is in fact HIV positive. The dishonesty displayed by
                    the husband in this profile coupled with his dishonesty in the affidavits he has
                    filed in these proceedings suggests a pattern of dishonest conduct. This is yet
                    another reason I have for doubting the veracity of the husband’s evidence
                    and for preferring the wife’s evidence on all contentious
                matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Although the husband posted this profile on
                    Manjam in 2012, there is every reason to believe that this sort of conduct
                    underlay the change in his behaviour observed by the wife during the marriage
                    and which led to the divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Third, the husband is involved with a
                    homosexual partner who also leads a particularly reckless and dissolute
                    lifestyle. The wife has placed before me evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>
                    that the partner was found in September 2009 unconscious under the bed of his
                    then homosexual lover, whose dead body was in the bed. The partner has also
                    admitted to using drugs such as Ecstasy and ketamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Fourth, the husband is HIV positive. Again, I
                    do not hold that fact against him in itself. Being HIV positive is today more in
                    the nature of a medical condition to be managed than the death sentence which it
                    once was. It is the circumstances in which the husband became HIV positive which
                    I take into account. It is the case that men who have sex with men can
                    drastically reduce their risk of acquiring HIV by the consistent exercise of
                    personal responsibility in their liaisons. The fact that the husband is now HIV
                    positive coupled with the evidence of his solicitation of sexual partners
                    suggests to me that his HIV status has arisen from promiscuous sexual behaviour,
                    a reckless failure to exercise personal responsibility or both. This is all the
                    more reckless given that he apparently lies to his homosexual partners about his
                    HIV positive status. I also bear in mind that the husband did not disclose his
                    HIV positive status to the wife until after she confronted him about his
                    behaviour in 2009. There is therefore every possibility that the husband exposed
                    the wife to a real risk of herself acquiring the virus during unprotected
                    heterosexual sex with the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Bearing all of the above in mind, in my view
                    the wife has made double the indirect contributions to the welfare of the family
                    that the husband has made. I therefore apportion the indirect contributions at
                    66.67% to the wife and 33.33% to the husband. If anything, I consider that
                    assessment overly generous to the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Just and equitable proportion of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I have found that the husband has made direct
                    contributions to the matrimonial assets of 46.49% and indirect contributions to
                    the welfare of the family of 33.33%. I have also found that the wife has made
                    direct contributions to the matrimonial assets of 53.51% and indirect
                    contributions to the welfare of the family of 66.67%. Averaging the two
                    percentages for each spouse and rounding off the result to the nearest whole
                    percentage point, I conclude that a just and equitable division of the
                    matrimonial assets would be to award the wife 60% of the matrimonial assets and
                    to award the husband 40%. The result in absolute terms is that, out of a pool of
                    matrimonial assets worth $2,650,747.54, the wife is entitled to $1,590,448.52
                    and the husband to $1,060,299.02.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Under <em>ANJ</em>’s structured approach, I do not consider that any further
                    adjustment needs to be made to those figures in the fourth step in order to
                    account for the remaining factors under s 112 of the Women’s Charter.
                    Stepping back and looking at the matter with a degree of perspective, a division
                    of 60% to the wife and 40% to the husband appears to me to be broadly fair
                    bearing in mind that this was a 15 year marriage and that I make separate
                    provision for the needs of the triplets. It is true that the husband has been
                    residing rent-free in matrimonial property – first in the Sembawang
                    property and then in the Serangoon property – since the wife left the
                    matrimonial home in January 2010 whereas the wife has been paying rent from her
                    own resources throughout that period. However, it appears to me that adjusting
                    the wife’s percentage upwards would be somewhat unfair to the husband,
                    particularly bearing in mind that he must be left with sufficient funds to house
                    himself and that his share is reduced further by the provision I make for lump
                    sum maintenance for the triplets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Deductions proposed by each party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Each party asks me to make certain deductions
                    from the other party’s share of the matrimonial assets. I consider these
                    deductions in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The wife’s proposed deductions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The wife points out that the net proceeds of
                    the sale of the Sembawang property account not only for the sum of $414,539.16
                    paid to OCBC to redeem the mortgage of the property (including all accrued
                    interest and late charges) but for the sum of $152,742.00<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> due to OCBC on the overdraft account
                    secured against the property. This overdraft indebtedness to OCBC was incurred
                    by the husband in December 2010. This was after the marriage had broken down.
                    The wife had by then left the matrimonial home and had commenced and concluded
                    both the personal protection proceedings and the guardianship proceedings. The
                    withdrawal took place without the knowledge or consent of the wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Despite all that, I decline to make any
                    adjustment for this sum. Although this withdrawal took place after the marriage
                    had broken down, it took place before the wife commenced divorce proceedings and
                    before the date of interlocutory judgment. It is that date which I use as the
                    cut-off date to ascertain the pool of matrimonial assets. There is no reason,
                    therefore, not to treat this overdraft liability as a matrimonial liability. In
                    addition, adding back the husband’s 40% share of this liability would
                    further reduce the sum awarded to him, an outcome which I do not consider would
                    be fair to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Second, the wife submits that she should not
                    bear any part of the husband’s income tax liability of $13,118.91 which
                    was deducted from the net proceeds of sale of the Sembawang property. I do not
                    accept this submission either. To the extent that the income on which this
                    income tax was levied is a matrimonial asset, the tax on that income is also a
                    matrimonial liability. I see no reason again to attribute this debt entirely to
                    the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Finally, the wife draws my attention to the
                    sum of $29,500 remaining due from the husband to the wife arising from the costs
                    orders in the personal protection proceedings, in the custody proceedings and in
                    these proceedings. This is an undisputed and indisputable debt. In my view, it
                    is just and equitable that a sum of $29,500 should be deducted from the
                    husband’s share and added to the wife’s share, thereby extinguishing
                    the husband’s liability to the wife for these costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The husband’s proposed deduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The husband asks that I require the wife to
                    bring into account the sum of $95,527.25 which the wife withdrew from the
                    account of [Q] Pte Ltd in February 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> The wife’s position is that this was a
                    part-payment to herself of unpaid salary amounting to $117,600 which was due to
                    her from the couple’s various businesses. Once again, the wife is able to
                    produce independent, contemporaneous documentary evidence to support her
                        assertion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> This
                    evidence comprises internal accounting documents from [P], [Q] Pte Ltd and the
                    couple’s spa business which she was able to obtain from a sympathetic
                        employee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> These documents confirm
                    the wife’s evidence about the undrawn salary which had accrued due to her.
                    I therefore accept her evidence and reject the husband’s submission. It
                    also appears to me that this sum is accounted for by the share capital of [R]
                    Pte Ltd, also formed in February 2010. I have treated the wife’s interest
                    in [R] Pte Ltd as a matrimonial asset. I therefore decline to make any deduction
                    from the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets to account for this
                    amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The result of considering these deductions is
                    that the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets ought to be enhanced by a
                    further $29,500, with a corresponding reduction in the husband’s share.
                    Following this adjustment, the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets in
                    absolute terms is $1,619,948.52 and the husband’s is
                $1,030,799.02.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Before considering how that division ought to
                    be effected, I turn to consider the issue of maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The wife’s primary position on
                    maintenance is that lump sum maintenance for herself and the triplets is
                    incorporated in her submission on the division of the matrimonial assets set out
                    at [31] above. Alternatively, if I am not minded to grant lump sum maintenance
                    for the wife and the triplets, the wife asks for maintenance for herself in the
                    sum of $7,000 a month and maintenance for the triplets in the total sum of
                    $7,094 a month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance for the wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The wife estimates her own monthly expenses at
                    $13,826.42 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>
                    Almost one-third of this sum comprises a lump sum of $4,000 per month sought for
                    “personal maintenance per month – health, medical, clothing, shoes,
                    cosmetics, facial, eating, family outings, insurance in the process of being
                    arranged, [handphone] bills, etc”. A further $2,800 per month is sought
                    for the wife’s rent. The wife also lists her aged mother as a financial
                    dependent to the extent of $800 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The list of factors I am obliged to have
                    regard to in determining the amount of maintenance to be paid by the husband to
                    the wife are set out in s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter. I consider
                    all of these factors in the round.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The wife is 49 years old. She has been
                    employed since 1 March 2010 by her own company, [R] Pte Ltd. Her starting salary
                    was $3,500 per month with a fixed transportation allowance of $1,000 per
                        month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> That was
                    increased with effect from 2011 to $4,000 per month plus the fixed transport
                    allowance of $1,000 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> Her income tax notices of assessment show
                    that she earned $68,022 in 2007, $116,001.40 in 2008 and $102,601 in
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The husband is 48 years old. He is
                        unemployed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> His income tax
                    notices of assessment show that he earned $67,024 in 2005, had no income in
                    2008, earned $151,830 in 2009 and had no income in 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> As I have mentioned, he is an
                    undischarged bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The marriage is a long one, lasting 15 years.
                    As I have found, the wife made twice the contributions to the welfare of the
                    family that the husband did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     It appears to me that it is not appropriate in
                    all the circumstances of the case to order the husband to pay maintenance to the
                    wife. I say that for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     First, the husband has no capacity to pay
                    maintenance. He is unemployed and an undischarged bankrupt. It is the
                    wife’s submission that his status both as unemployed and as a bankrupt is
                    a ploy by him to evade his obligations to his wife and family upon divorce. I
                    have no basis on which to find that that is true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Second, the wife has shown herself to be a
                    resourceful businesswoman, capable of achieving economic independence both
                    during the marriage and after it. Her need for maintenance is correspondingly
                    reduced. I bear in mind also that although her current income appears modest,
                    she is in fact not just an employee of [R] Pte Ltd but a 99% owner of it as
                    well. She is therefore entitled to receive not just a salary from [R] Pte Ltd as
                    its employee but also virtually all of its profits as its proprietor. It
                    therefore appears to me that the wife is capable, subject to receiving
                    maintenance for the triplets, of maintaining after the divorce the same standard
                    of living enjoyed by the family during the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     However, in case the circumstances of either
                    spouse or of both spouses change to warrant a reconsideration of the issue of
                    maintenance, I grant the wife liberty to apply for maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In declining to award the wife substantive
                    maintenance for herself at this stage, I express no view on the reasonableness
                    or otherwise of the components of her monthly expenses on which she bases her
                    claim for monthly maintenance of $7,000 per month. That will have to be
                    determined separately if and when it arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance for the triplets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The wife seeks maintenance of $7,094 per
                    month for the triplets. Rounded off, this sum amounts to an average of $2,365
                    per child. The breakdown provided by the wife for each child shows nothing
                    exceptional. She has made provision for typical and reasonable sums for the
                    triplets’ clothing, medical costs, school fees, tuition and related
                    expenses, extra-curricular activities and transportation. I therefore find that
                    $7,094 per month is a reasonable amount for the maintenance of the
                    triplets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The triplets are approximately 11½
                    years of age. They will achieve majority in another 9½ years. The cost of
                    maintaining them until they reach majority, on the figures put forward by the
                    wife, will be $808,716.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    That sum of $808,716 is not the correct
                    measure of the husband's liability for maintenance. First, under s 68 of the
                    Women’s Charter, the obligation to maintain the triplets is an obligation
                    of both parents. The husband and wife are both of equal earning capacity. I
                    therefore hold that they should each bear equally the cost of maintaining the
                    triplets until they attain majority. The husband’s 50% share of the
                    triplets’ maintenance is $404,358.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Second, the liability of the husband to pay
                    lump sum maintenance for the triplets must be discounted to account for the time
                    value of money. The wife will receive the maintenance as a lump sum now but will
                    spend it only at the rate of $3,547 per month over the coming 9½ years. I
                    consider that an appropriate discount rate to apply would be 4.25% per annum,
                    representing a realistically achievable rate of return in the current investment
                    environment. That annual discount rate over 9½ years is equivalent to a
                    flat discount of 19%. I therefore discount the sum of $404,358 by 19% to account
                    for the time value of money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The result is that I hold that the husband
                    shall pay lump sum maintenance to the wife for the triplets in the sum of
                    $327,529.98.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mode of payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I summarise my holdings so far. I have held
                    that the wife is entitled to receive $1,619,948.52 as her share of the
                    matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter and in extinction of
                    the husband’s existing liability to her for unpaid legal costs. I have
                    further held that the wife should receive the sum of $327,529.98 as lump sum
                    maintenance for the triplets. The total sum payable to the wife is therefore
                    $1,947,478.50.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    That sum of $1,947,478.50 shall be paid to

                    percentages to 60% and 40% in that asset. Although the resulting total is
                    $577.40 short of $1,947,478.50, that is a variance of only 0.03%. It is

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The effect of bankruptcy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Having arrived at a just and equitable
                    division of the matrimonial property, I now consider the effect of the
                    husband’s bankruptcy. I first set out again the chronology of relevant
                    events. The wife commenced these proceedings on 27 January 2011. She secured
                    interim judgment on 25 October 2011. A creditor of the husband presented its
                    bankruptcy application against him on 4 April 2012. The husband was adjudged
                    bankrupt on 29 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Two consequences followed upon the husband
                    being adjudged bankrupt. First, under s 76(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act, a statutory moratorium came into force
                    preventing all of the husband’s creditors from pursuing any remedy, action
                    or proceedings against him in respect of any debt provable in his bankruptcy.
                    Second, under s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act
                    (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Act”), the husband’s
                    property vested in the Official Assignee immediately and became divisible
                    amongst his creditors, subject only to the exceptions set out in s 78(2) of
                    the Bankruptcy Act. The only assets of the husband which fall within s 78(2) are
                    the credit balances in his CPF account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The statutory moratorium under s
                        76(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act is no obstacle
                    to these divorce proceedings continuing against the husband or to my dividing
                    the matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. A wife pursuing
                    divorce proceedings against a husband and seeking a just and equitable division
                    of the matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter is
                    outside s 76(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act. She is
                    not a creditor of the husband in any sense of the word and is not seeking to
                    pursue any remedy, action or proceeding against the husband in respect of any
                    debt provable in the husband’s bankruptcy. In <em>JA v
                        JB</em> [2005] SGDC 104 (“<em>JA v
                    JB</em>”), it was held that the court may hear and determine a
                    wife's application to divide the parties' matrimonial assets under s 112 of
                    the Women’s Charter and award maintenance for her and the children of the
                    marriage notwithstanding the husband's bankruptcy because that application, not
                    being in respect of a debt provable in bankruptcy, is outside the prohibition in
                        s 76(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act. I
                    accept that proposition as correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    
          <em>JA v JB</em> does
                    not, however, consider the interaction between the statutory vesting of the
                    bankrupt’s property in the Official Assignee under s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act, and the court’s power to
                    divide matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. This
                    interaction is of some importance. A bankruptcy can be used tactically to
                    obstruct or delay the court exercising its jurisdiction under s 112. Likewise,
                    divorce proceedings can be brought collusively to put the assets of an insolvent
                    or near insolvent spouse beyond the reach of his creditors through a transfer of
                    property sought and made under s 112 of the Women’s
                Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Where a spouse is adjudged bankrupt before
                    the matrimonial assets can be divided under s 112 of the Women’s Charter,
                    the bankruptcy creates a fundamental difficulty. The vesting of the bankrupt
                    spouse’s assets in the Official Assignee under s 76(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act prevents a court which is exercising
                    matrimonial jurisdiction from making any order under s 112 which affects
                    the vested assets. That is the case for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    First, s 112 is predicated on title to the
                    matrimonial assets which are to be divided being vested in the spouses. That is
                    no longer the case when a spouse has been adjudicated bankrupt. Subject only to
                    the provisions of s 78(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, the simple position is
                    that the bankrupt spouse no longer owns any matrimonial assets: his interest in
                    those assets is vested in the Official Assignee. That includes the bankrupt
                    spouse’s title to jointly-held matrimonial assets. There is nothing in
                    s 112 which allows the court in its matrimonial jurisdiction to disregard
                    this statutory divesting of the bankrupt spouse’s assets or to engineer a
                    re-vesting of those assets in the bankrupt spouse so that they become available
                    for division under s 112. The general power to set aside a disposition by a
                    husband under s 132 of the Women’s Charter applies only to a
                    disposition by the husband which is voluntary, and not to the disposition which
                    take place by operation of law upon a bankruptcy order being made, even if the
                    husband commenced the bankruptcy proceedings himself: see <em>Woodley v Woodley (No. 2)</em> [1993] 2 FLR 477.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The second reason that a bankruptcy order
                    prevents the court from dividing matrimonial assets under s 112 of the
                    Women’s Charter is that the court’s power under that section permits
                    the court to divide matrimonial assets and order the transfer of matrimonial
                    assets only as between the parties to the marriage. The Official Assignee, quite
                    obviously, is not a party to the marriage. The court therefore has no power,
                    under s 112, to affect the Official Assignee’s title to the assets vested
                    in him by operation of law under s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act or to order the Official Assignee to transfer or sell any of
                    those assets: <em>In Re Holliday</em> [1981] 1 Ch 405 at
                    421D per Goff LJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The court’s powers under s 112 of the
                    Women’s Charter can be exercised against a bankruptcy spouse only in
                    respect of those of his assets which have not vested in the Official Assignee
                    because they are excluded from the vesting under s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) by s 78(2) of the Bankruptcy Act. These assets include those
                    specifically enumerated in s 78(2) of the Bankruptcy Act as well as those
                    protected by other written law. Most notable in the latter category is HDB
                    property, which is protected by s 51(5) of the Housing and Development Act
                    (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed), and CPF money, which is protected by
                        s 24(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Central Provident Fund
                    Act (Cap 36, 2013 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    With respect to assets which have vested in
                    the Official Assignee, the most that a court can do under s 112 of the
                    Women’s Charter is to take the value of those divested assets into account
                    by notionally adding them back to the pool of matrimonial assets and dividing
                    the enlarged pool in accordance with s 112, but without encroaching on the
                    assets vested in the Official Assignee. That, of course, is no solution where
                    the non-bankrupt spouse lays claim to some or all of the matrimonial assets now
                    vested in the OA or where the bankrupt spouse claims that some of the debts
                    provable in his bankruptcy are matrimonial debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    A non-bankrupt spouse who seeks a transfer
                    of assets which have vested in the Official Assignee under s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act must first effect a re-vesting
                    of those assets in the bankrupt spouse. Section 132 of the Women’s
                    Charter is unavailable to effect this re-vesting (see [113] above). Further,
                    although the bankruptcy court has a general discretion to rescind its orders,
                    including bankruptcy orders, under s 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, that discretion is
                    to be exercised with caution and only in exceptional circumstances: see
                        <em>Fitch v Fitch</em> [1996] 1 WLR 242 and <em>Papanicola v Humphreys</em> [2005] 2 All ER
                418.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The only practicable way for the
                    non-bankrupt spouse to achieve that re-vesting is by securing the annulment of
                    the bankruptcy order. There are two ways in which she can secure that annulment.
                    First, she can apply for an annulment of the bankruptcy under
                        s 123(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Bankruptcy Act on the
                    grounds that the bankruptcy order ought not to have been made, <em>eg</em> by showing that the bankrupt spouse was not in fact
                    insolvent at that time: see <em>Whig v Whig</em> [2008] 1
                    FLR 453 and <em>Paulin v Paulin</em> [2010] 1 WLR 1057.
                    Second, the non-bankrupt spouse can take it upon herself to pay off all of the
                    bankrupt spouse's debts and thereafter seek an annulment of the bankruptcy order
                    either by the court under s 123(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act or by certificate of the Official Assignee under s 123A(1)
                    Bankruptcy Act. Both of these courses of action, unfortunately, require
                    significant financial risk and expenditure, whether in costs or in repayments,
                    by the non-bankrupt spouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    If the non-bankrupt spouse is unable or
                    unwilling to secure a re-vesting of the bankrupt’s spouse’s property
                    in him through either of these approaches, she has no alternative but to defer
                    the resolution of the ancillary matters until the bankruptcy order is annulled
                    either upon the application of the bankrupt spouse or by or upon the application
                    of the OA. So long as the bankruptcy order remains in effect, only the assets
                    excluded from the operation of the vesting order by s 78(2) of the Bankruptcy
                    Act remain vested in the bankrupt spouse and available for division under
                    s 112 of the Women’s Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In this case, I have held that a just and
                    equitable division of the matrimonial assets requires the husband to transfer to
                    the wife his entire interest in the Serangoon property and 10.45% of the
                    stakeholding sum with Mallal &amp; Namazie out of his 50.45% share of that sum.
                    But both these assets of the husband vested in the Official Assignee when the
                    husband was made bankrupt. The Official Assignee is beyond the reach of any
                    order I can make under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. The husband’s
                    bankruptcy would therefore ordinarily have made it impossible for me to order
                    the transfer necessary to bring about the division of the matrimonial assets
                    which I have found to be just and equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In those circumstances, I would ordinarily
                    have adjourned these ancillary proceedings to permit the wife to consider
                    whether she wished to take the necessary steps to have the husband’s
                    bankruptcy annulled under either limb of s 123 of the Bankruptcy
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    This case is not, however, the ordinary
                    case. At my request, a representative of the Official Assignee’s office
                    attended the hearing of this matter to assist the court. I considered it
                    important to hear from the Official Assignee as the voice of the husband’s
                    creditors. Once a spouse has been made bankrupt, third party interests intrude
                    on the division of matrimonial assets. Every dollar of matrimonial assets
                    transferred away from the bankrupt spouse under s 112 of the Women’s
                    Charter is one fewer dollar available to pay the bankrupt spouse’s
                    creditors. There is no reason in principle why the creditors’ interests
                    should inevitably and in every case be subordinated to the non-bankrupt
                    spouse’s interest. Indeed, the Bankruptcy Act prioritises the rights of
                    creditors over the rights of a non-bankrupt spouse on at least two occasions:
                    see s 53 and s 55 of the Women’s Charter. There is also English authority
                    that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, creditors’ rights ought
                    ordinarily to prevail over the non-bankrupt spouse’s rights: <em>In Re Citro (Domenico) (A Bankrupt)</em> [1991] Ch 142 at
                    157A. In those circumstances, it is important that all three sets of competing
                    interests be actively represented before the matrimonial court, even if there is
                    no basis to suspect collusion between husband and wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    I ascertained from the Official Assignee
                    that the debts proved in the husband’s bankruptcy amount to $123,391.44.
                    That is very close to the value of the 40% share which I have found the husband
                    is entitled to out of the net proceeds of sale of the Sembawang property. That
                    is why this is not the ordinary case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    It would not ordinarily be appropriate for a
                    court hearing ancillary proceedings in its matrimonial jurisdiction to make
                    orders which have the potential to affect the rights of creditors in an ongoing
                    bankruptcy. But where the share of the matrimonial assets which a court
                    exercising matrimonial jurisdiction has determined it is just and equitable for
                    the bankrupt spouse to receive suffices to repay all of his creditors in full,
                    as in the present case, the creditors’ interests recede from view: see
                        <em>Hellyer v Hellyer</em> [1996] 2 FLR 579. I
                    therefore consider it just and convenient to exercise my power under s 112 to
                    effect a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets, but to do so, in
                    the unusual circumstances of this case, subject to a condition precedent which I
                    attach pursuant to my powers under s 112(5)(<em>e</em>) and s 112(8) of the Women’s Charter. That condition
                    precedent is the annulment of the husband’s bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I have therefore ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mallal &amp; Namazie shall release
                        to the Official Assignee from the stakeholding sum which they hold an amount
                        sufficient to secure the annulment of the husband’s bankruptcy by
                        certificate of the Official Assignee under s 123A of the Bankruptcy
                        Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_b"></a>(b)     Subject
                        to the bankruptcy of the husband being annulled under s 123A, and
                        immediately thereupon without need for further order, the following
                        ancillary orders shall take effect:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_125-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The husband shall deliver
                            to the wife vacant possession of the Serangoon property within two
                            months of the annulment.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_125-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The husband shall transfer to the wife the
                            entirety of his right, title and interest in the Serangoon
                            property.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_125-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Mallal &amp; Namazie shall release to the
                            wife the balance of the stakeholding money which they
                        hold.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_125-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The wife shall have no further claim against the husband for any unpaid
                            costs orders in these or any other proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_125-p2_b-p3_v"></a>(v)       Each party shall retain the
                            assets in his or her sole name.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_125-p2_b-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       The wife shall transfer to the husband all the
                            shares registered in her name in [Q] Pte Ltd and renounce any interest,
                            legal or beneficial, therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These steps, once taken, will discharge entirely the husband’s
                        obligations towards the wife arising from my division of the spouse’s
                        matrimonial assets. I have given the parties and the Official Assignee
                        liberty to apply in relation to matters arising from the implementation of
                        this order or arising from unforeseen contingencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    I now turn to consider the issue of custody
                    of the triplets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Custody and access</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    As I have mentioned, the wife has had sole
                    custody, care and control of the triplets since 2010, with the husband having
                    supervised access to the triplets for two hours every Saturday at the Woodlands
                    Civic Centre, together with reasonable telephone access. The wife asks that
                    those orders continue without variation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The husband asks that I order joint custody
                    of the triplets with care and control to the wife and liberal access to the
                    husband. He asks for access to the triplets: (i) from 10.00 am to 8.00 pm on
                    alternate Saturdays; (ii) overnight from 10.00 am on Saturday to 6.00 pm on
                    Sunday on alternate weekends; (iii) from 10.00 am to 6.00 pm on alternate public
                    holidays; (iv) half of the school holidays; (v) for the triplets’
                    birthdays in alternate years, if he does not otherwise have access on that day;
                    (vi) for his own birthday; and (vii) over the Lunar New Year holiday period
                    every year, to be divided between himself and the wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    It being common ground that the wife is to
                    have care and control of the triplets, the only issues I have to decide are
                    custody of and access to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Custody</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    As the Court of Appeal pointed out in
                        <em>CX v CY</em> (minor: custody and access) [2005] 3
                    SLR(R) 690 (“<em>CX</em>”) at [31], the
                    distinction between “custody” and “care and control”
                    in the context of divorcing parents is that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... “care and control” concerns day-to-day decision-making,
                        while residual “custody” concerns the long-term
                        decision-making for the welfare of the child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The result of the order in the guardianship proceedings in
                        2010 was to remove from the husband any right to be involved in the
                        long-term decision-making for the welfare of the triplets. I am not, of
                        course, bound in any way by that decision. I therefore consider afresh
                        whether it is right in the circumstances prevailing today for the husband to
                        be granted joint custody of the triplets with the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    It is by now well-established that making an
                    order for joint custody of a child of a marriage is the norm with an order for
                    sole custody being exceptional: <em>CX</em> at [24]. The
                    reason for this is that ordinarily, it is in the best interests of a child and
                    promotes the child’s welfare for the child to have the direct involvement
                    of both parents in his life: <em>CX</em> at [26] and [27].
                    The making of a joint custody order also “reminds the parents that the
                    law expects both of them to co-operate to promote the child’s best
                    interest”: <em>CX</em> at [28].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The Court of Appeal made clear in <em>CX</em> that subsisting acrimony between the parents or a
                    demonstrated inability to co-operate in decision-making affecting the child are
                    not, in themselves, sufficiently exceptional circumstances to warrant a sole
                    custody order. A sole custody order is warranted only where there are
                    circumstances which indicate that a joint custody order would not be in the best
                    interests of the child. The Court of Appeal (at [38]) gave the following as
                    examples of such circumstances:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We agree with Assoc Prof Debbie Ong that the exceptional circumstances
                        where sole custody orders are made may be where one parent physically,
                        sexually or emotionally abuses the child ... or where the relationship of
                        the parties is such that co-operation is impossible even after avenues of
                        mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of cooperation is
                        harmful to the child. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    I do not consider it in the triplets’
                    best interests for the husband to be involved in long-term decision-making for
                    their welfare. I say that because the husband has, at least since 2008,
                    demonstrated a very poor ability to make decisions even for his own welfare.
                    Indeed, what he has shown is an ability to make decisions which are positively
                    detrimental to his own welfare. I rely for this on: (i) his convictions for
                    possession and consumption of illegal drugs; (ii) his promiscuous lifestyle
                    (see [73] above); and (iii) the recklessness by which he is likely to have
                    acquired his HIV positive status. When the husband has restored some order to
                    his life and is able once again to demonstrate an ability to make long-term
                    decisions for his own welfare over an extended period of time, the question of
                    whether he should have an involvement in the long-term decision-making for the
                    welfare of his triplets can be revisited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In denying the husband’s request for
                    joint custody, I bear in mind also that the husband has committed a battery upon
                    the wife. Although the battery did not cause her serious injuries and has not
                    been repeated, his aggressive behaviour towards her continued even after 2010.
                    All of this has combined to leave the wife in fear of having to deal with the
                        husband,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> as she would have to if I
                    were to order joint custody.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    I should make it clear that I do not rely
                    either on the husband’s sexual orientation or on his HIV positive status
                    as reasons in themselves for excluding him from custody of the triplets. The
                    husband is in the same position as any parent, whatever the gender or sexual
                    orientation, who has displayed the appallingly poor decision-making ability that
                    the husband has in the recent past.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Access</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    I also decline to order any access for the
                    husband which is more liberal than the two hours a week supervised access and
                    the telephone access that is now in place. I have two reasons. First, the
                    husband has not sought access to the triplets since June 2010 and only
                    infrequently exercised the access which the wife voluntarily offered him before
                        then.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> This was the
                    case quite apart from his inability to take access during his imprisonment in
                    2013. There is also no evidence that he has been taking his supervised access
                    with the triplets regularly after his release from prison in September 2013.
                    Second, I do not consider it in the triplets’ best interests to be exposed
                    to the husband’s reckless and dissolute lifestyle so long as that
                    lifestyle continues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    It is also my view that the husband’s
                    existing access should continue to be supervised. First, the husband has on
                    previous occasions deliberately failed to return the triplets to the wife after
                    unsupervised access.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> In his oral submissions
                    before me, without a trace of irony, the husband himself used the term
                    “kidnap” to refer to his actions. Second, the father has shown a
                    propensity not to act in the triplets’ best interests when unsupervised. I
                    have in mind the displays of temper towards the triplets and the use of physical
                    force against one of the triplets which the wife relied upon in the personal
                    protection proceedings and which the husband effectively admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    This being an uncontested divorce, I made no
                    order as to costs.</p>
