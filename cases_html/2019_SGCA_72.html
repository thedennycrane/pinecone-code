It succeeded before the High Court in defending the claims brought by the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, the appellant in CA 78, and was awarded costs fixed at over $2m. By way of the present application, Summons No 116 of 2019 (“SUM 116”), PNG Sustainable Development Program Limited applied for CA 78 to be stayed until the Independent State of Papua New Guinea paid the costs awarded by the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 I will, in these grounds, refer to the applicant in SUM 116 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the respondent in CA 78) as “PNGSDP” and the respondent in SUM 116 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the appellant in CA 78) as “the State”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The present application concerns the issue of when an appeal may be stayed pending the payment of costs awarded by the court below, which is an issue of some practical importance. I heard the application as a single judge sitting in the Court of Appeal. Having heard the parties’ submissions, I dismissed PNGSDP’s application for the appeal to be stayed, for reasons which I will explain in these grounds. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In Suit No 795 of 2014 and Originating Summons No 234 of 2015 (collectively, “the consolidated proceedings”), the State as plaintiff sought to establish the existence of and enforce rights of control and oversight which it claimed to have over the operations and assets of the defendant, PNGSDP. The trial for the consolidated proceedings took place in 2018, following which the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) reserved judgment. On 2 April 2019, the Judge issued his judgment which can be found at <span class="font-italic">Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd</span> [2019] SGHC 68. In summary, the Judge dismissed all of the State’s claims against PNGSDP.

In that case, the respondents in the substantive appeal applied for the appeal to be stayed until the taxed costs of the first respondent in the action below were paid by the appellants. The application was first heard by a single judge of the Court of Appeal who allowed the respondents’ application. The appellants then applied by way of motion to discharge the stay order. A three-judge Court of Appeal allowed the appellants’ motion and discharged the stay order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The three-judge Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Roberto</span> that it had the inherent jurisdiction, as preserved under O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court, to require an appellant to pay the costs of the action below, on penalty of the appeal being stayed (at [15]).

The relevant portion of s 36(1) referred to by the court in <span class="font-italic">Roberto</span> remains the same in substance today, notwithstanding some modifications in the precise wording.

The court explained (<span class="font-italic">Roberto </span>at [17] and [19]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 … [T]his inherent jurisdiction should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it and the justice of the case so demands. The circumstances must be special. The costs due to the successful party in the court below, unless there is an order for a stay of execution, are a debt which is recoverable under the normal enforcement process. Ordinarily, this would have nothing to do with the appeal which is pending. It may well be true that if the successful party were to seek execution by bankruptcy proceedings, he could encounter some problems in view of the fact that the case is under appeal. But that is not the only manner of execution. In any event, a right of appeal should not be curtailed by considerations which are extraneous to the appeal. The appellate court should not be used as a means to enable the respondent to obtain payment of his taxed costs. The appeal, if it proceeds, would only cause prejudice to the respondent as to the costs of the appeal, as he would have to incur the expenses of defending the judgment. To that extent, he is entitled to be secured.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 Accordingly, the circumstances where such an order may be made must be rare indeed. We do not wish to prejudge matters or lay down any definite considerations. It is the twin criteria of prejudice/justice which would be decisive. Purely as an example, if a plaintiff was required by the court below to furnish security, and failed to do so, and the case went on to trial as the defendant wished to have the matter disposed of expeditiously, and the plaintiff then failed and appealed, this may be the sort of circumstance where the appeal court could invoke that jurisdiction to order payment of the costs below before the appeal may be allowed to proceed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On the facts of the case, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the stay ought not to have been granted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">SOPA cases </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Aside from <span class="font-italic">Roberto</span>, PNGSDP relied on the cases of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh</span> and <span class="font-italic">FT Plumbing</span>, which concerned applications by a defendant to stay proceedings commenced by the plaintiff, where the judgment debt and costs of separate proceedings between the parties remained unpaid by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh</span>, the plaintiff engaged the defendant to build a pair of semi-detached houses. The defendant brought adjudication proceedings against the plaintiff and was awarded the sum of $138,660 (“Judgment Debt”). In Originating Summons No 381 of 2013 (“OS 381”), leave was granted to the defendant to enforce the adjudication determination as a judgment debt. Without having paid the Judgment Debt, the plaintiff commenced a separate suit against the defendant (“Suit 92”) for damages for uncompleted and defective works. The defendant applied to stay Suit 92 pending payment by the plaintiff of the Judgment Debt and all outstanding costs awarded to the defendant in the various proceedings between the parties. The defendant’s stay application was allowed by the assistant registrar, whose decision was affirmed on appeal. In respect of the outstanding costs, the High Court judge found that the plaintiff had the means to pay the outstanding costs but was simply refusing to do so (at [12]). The plaintiff’s conduct demonstrated that she was picking and choosing which outstanding orders of court to comply with so that she would not weaken the legal position that she was adopting. In particular, to support her legal position, she had deliberately paid all of the interlocutory costs orders made in Suit 92 but not the costs arising from OS 381 (at [13]). This demonstrated her attempt to “game the system”, and “use the power of [the] Court when it suit[ed] her and disregard it when it [did] not” (at [13]). As for the plaintiff’s non-payment of the Judgement Debt, the High Court judge noted that a fundamental premise of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“SOPA”) regime was that a successful claimant should be paid speedily, and thus the plaintiff should not be allowed to continue to deprive the defendant of its right to prompt payment (at [18] and [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">FT P</span><span class="font-italic">lumbing,</span> the defendant succeeded in adjudication proceedings against the plaintiff and sought to enforce the adjudication determination as a judgment debt. The plaintiff commenced a suit against the defendant, seeking a final determination of the dispute arising out of the construction contract between the parties. The defendant applied to stay the suit, alleging that the plaintiff’s commencement of the suit amounted to an abuse of process of the court given that the plaintiff had not paid the adjudicated amount to the defendant. The issue considered by the assistant registrar in <span class="font-italic">FT Plumbing</span> was whether it would be an abuse of process for the losing party in an adjudication to commence proceedings in court to obtain a final determination of the underlying dispute between the parties despite not having paid the adjudicated amount (<span class="font-italic">FT Plumbing</span> at [19]). Following the case of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh</span>, the assistant registrar granted the stay, rejecting the plaintiff’s claim that it genuinely did not have the ability to make payment (at [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 From the above, it is apparent that the question before the court in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh</span> and <span class="font-italic">FT Plumbing</span> was not on all fours with that which was before me in SUM 116. In particular, the stay applications in those two cases arose within the specific context of the SOPA regime, where the object of the regime was of relevance. In the present case, on the other hand, the issue was whether an appeal pending before the Court of Appeal should be stayed until the costs awarded below were paid by the appellant. In the circumstances, the usefulness of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh</span> and <span class="font-italic">FT Plumbing</span> in the present application was in my view to some extent limited. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">English cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Although not highlighted by PNGSDP or the State, there were a number of English cases relevant to the issue of whether an appeal should be stayed pending payment of the judgment debt or costs below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Under the English Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”), the appellate court has a discretion to “impose … conditions upon which an appeal may be brought” where there was a “compelling reason” for doing so (CPR 52.18(1)(c) read with 52.18(2)). Singapore does not have a similar provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In<span class="font-italic"> Hammond </span><span class="font-italic">Suddard Solicitors v Agrichem International Holdings Ltd </span>[2001] All ER(D) 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Hammond </span><span class="font-italic">Suddard</span>”), the English Court of Appeal held that these provisions gave the court the discretion to order the continued prosecution of an appeal to be made conditional on the appellant’s payment of the judgment debt and costs below (at [38]–[40]). In that case, the appellant was a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The respondents opposed the appellant's application for a stay of execution of the judgment below, and asked for an order that the appellant be allowed to continue its appeal only if it paid or secured the full amount of the judgment debt and costs below. The court granted the order sought by the respondents, having taken into account the following six factors which, when combined, sufficed to constitute a compelling reason (at [41]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) The appellant is an entity against whom it will be difficult to exercise the normal mechanisms of enforcement. It is registered in the British Virgin Islands and has no assets in the United Kingdom. There is, accordingly, a very real risk that if the appeal fails, the respondents will be unable to recover the judgment debts and costs as ordered by Silber J. Given the attitude of the appellant to date, including that demonstrated on these applications, it is fanciful to think that the appellant will co-operate in the enforcement process.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The appellant plainly either has the resources or has access to resources which enable it both to instruct solicitors and leading and junior counsel to prosecute its appeal and make an application to the court for a stay of execution and to provide a substantial sum by way of security for costs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) There is no convincing evidence that the appellant does not either have the resources or have access to resources which would enable it to pay the judgment debt and costs as ordered. It has failed to do so. It is, accordingly, in breach of the orders made by Silber J on 12 July 2001.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) The discovery which the appellant has provided of its financial affairs is inadequate and gives the court no confidence that it has been shown anything near the truth. Moreover, as stated earlier, it has produced evidence (when it wanted to) that it was a thriving and profitable institution. It has wealthy owners and there is no evidence that, if they were minded to do so, they could not pay the judgment debt including the outstanding orders for costs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) For the reasons we have already given we are not persuaded that this appeal will be stifled if we make the order sought.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) In these circumstances, we find it unacceptable that absent any other orders of the court the appellant is intending to prosecute the appeal (and is willing to put up security for costs in order to do so) whilst at the same time continuing to disobey the orders of the court to pay the judgment debt and costs, as well as seeking to persuade us that it cannot do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Thus, based on <span class="font-italic">Hammond </span><span class="font-italic">Suddard</span>, it would appear that in England, the fact that there is a real risk that the respondent would be unable to recover the judgment debt and costs below in the event the appellant fails in the appeal (due to difficulties in enforcement), alongside the lack of evidence from the appellant that it is unable to make payment, is sufficient to constitute a compelling reason for the stay to be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">Bell Electric </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Aweco Appliance Systems GmbH &amp; Co KG </span>[2003] 1 All ER 344, the English Court of Appeal further held that even where there was no reason to suppose that vigorously pursued steps of enforcement would <span class="font-italic">ultimately </span>prove fruitless if the appeal fails, there may nonetheless be a compelling reason for the stay to be granted (at [22]). Such compelling reason may be found where the reason for the appellant’s non-payment of the judgment debt and costs below is not financial difficulty, but its knowledge that the respondent is unlikely to commence enforcement proceedings while the appeal is pending due to practical difficulties (at [22]–[23]). The court stated (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Potter LJ, with whom Carnwath LJ agreed): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[22] The question posed in this case, to which the judgment in the <span class="font-italic">Hammond </span><span class="font-italic">Suddard</span> case provides no answer, is whether, where there is no reason to suppose that vigorously pursued steps by way of enforcement will <span class="font-italic">ultimately</span> prove fruitless if the appeal fails, there may none the less be a ‘compelling reason’ meanwhile to make an order staying the appeal if the interim order is not complied with, or a payment into court made or other security provided in respect of the judgment sum. Depending upon the overall circumstances, I see no reason <span class="font-italic">in principle</span> why that should not be so in a case where (i) the appellant is in deliberate breach of the order to pay the judgment sum; (ii) he has applied for and been refused a stay; (iii) his failure or delay in payment is due not to any financial difficulty but is cynically based upon the practical difficulties for the respondent in seeking enforcement in a foreign jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[26] … It is implicit in the decision I have reached that I reject the argument that, if the ‘normal’ processes of enforcement are available to a successful party in respect of a sum ordered to be paid following trial, that is fatal per se to a successful application under r 52.9 [now r 52.18] for payment for security in respect of the judgment sum. I think it clear that, in the ordinary case of an appeal by an individual or company resident in the United Kingdom or possessed of assets here, the court would be most unlikely to regard the failure of an unsuccessful defendant to pay the judgment sum following refusal of a stay of execution as constituting a compelling reason to deploy its powers under r 52.9. In such a case, in the absence of very exceptional circumstances, it seems plain that the remedy of execution and/or bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings should be deployed as the appropriate and effective route to enforcement. None the less where, as here, a litigant of means, whether a United Kingdom resident or a resident in a member state of the Community subject to the regulation, demonstrates its intention to ignore the orders of the court and to rely upon the expense or other practical difficulties which may confront the respondent in seeking enforcement of its judgment abroad, it may well be appropriate for the court to exercise its powers under r 52.9. In my view this is such a case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the recent case of <span class="font-italic">Goldtrail</span><span class="font-italic"> Travel Ltd (in liquidation) v Onur Air Tasimacilik AS</span> [2018] 1 All ER 721 (“<span class="font-italic">Goldtrail</span><span class="font-italic"> Travel Ltd</span>”), the UK Supreme Court approved of the Court of Appeal’s holdings in <span class="font-italic">Hammond </span><span class="font-italic">Suddard </span>at [41(1)]–[41(3)], including the Court of Appeal’s treatment of the likely difficulties faced by the successful party in enforcement as a relevant factor in the consideration of whether there was a compelling reason for the stay to be granted (<span class="font-italic">Goldtrail</span><span class="font-italic"> Travel Ltd </span>at [21]). It cautioned, however, against the Court of Appeal’s phraseology at [41(4)] concerning the issue of when the appellant’s access to funds from a third party could be taken into account in assessing the likelihood that it could make payment of the judgment debt (see <span class="font-italic">Goldtrail</span><span class="font-italic"> Travel Ltd </span>at [22]). The UK Supreme Court also emphasised that a condition to the appellant’s continuation of the appeal should not be imposed where the effect of such a condition would be to stifle the appeal. The Supreme Court observed in particular (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Wilson, with whom Lord Neuberger P and Lord Hodge agreed): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[12] To stifle an appeal is to prevent an appellant from bringing it or continuing it. If an appellant has permission to bring an appeal, it is wrong to impose a condition which has the effect of preventing him from bringing it or continuing it. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[15] There is no doubt—indeed it is agreed—that, if the proposed condition is otherwise appropriate, the objection that it would stifle the continuation of the appeal represents a contention which needs to be established by the appellant and indeed, although it is hypothetical, to be established on the balance of probabilities: for the respondent to the appeal can hardly be expected to establish matters relating to the reality of the appellant’s financial situation of which he probably knows little.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[16] But, for all practical purposes, courts can proceed on the basis that, were it to be established that it would probably stifle the appeal, the condition should not be imposed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my judgment, the following principles may be distilled from the above-cited three English cases: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In an application by the respondent for a stay of appeal pending payment by the appellant of the judgment debt or costs below, the respondent has to show that there is a “compelling reason” for such a stay to be granted. A compelling reason is provided if the respondent would likely face difficulties in enforcing the judgment in the event the appellant loses the appeal, and the appellant’s non-payment of the judgment debt or costs is not due to financial difficulty but an illegitimate reason. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If a compelling reason is provided by the respondent for the stay to be granted, the appellant will have to establish on a balance of probabilities that the stay will stifle its appeal because of its inability to make payment, in order for the stay not to be granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I noted a difference between the principles underlying the approach set out by this court in <span class="font-italic">Roberto</span> and the English approach. Under the English approach, a key consideration is the timely payment of a judgment debt or costs and this principle justifies the grant of a stay of the appeal where the appellant can afford to pay the costs below but fails to do so. As the English Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Hammond </span><span class="font-italic">Suddard</span> (at [48]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48. … We do not disagree with Rix LA [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] “cautious” approach to CPR rule 52.9 [now CPR 52.18] … We do, however, take the view that the new regime of the CPR, with its emphasis on the timely payment of costs, and the use of costs as a sanction, warrants a robust approach to appellants who fail to obey orders for the payment of a judgment debt and costs when they can afford to pay them either themselves or through others.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Roberto</span>, however, this court emphasised that a stay of appeal pending payment of costs below should only be granted in “rare” cases as the right of appeal should not be curtailed by considerations which are extraneous to the appeal. It was explained that the appellate court should not be used as a means to enable the respondent to obtain payment of his taxed costs (<span class="font-italic">Roberto</span> at [17]). On this basis, <span class="font-italic">Roberto</span> suggests that the mere fact that the appellant has the ability to pay the costs below but has not done so is not a special or exceptional reason for a stay to be granted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As mentioned, PNGSDP submitted that there were two factors which made the circumstances of the present case exceptional.

</div> Second, PNGSDP argued that it would likely face difficulties in enforcing the costs orders against the State in Papua New Guinea. As both of these allegations were not made out on the evidence, there was no basis for the stay to be granted and I accordingly dismissed SUM 116. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of process </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 First, PNGSDP relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh</span> to argue that a stay should be granted because the State was allegedly able but unwilling to pay the Outstanding Sum. As for the reason provided by the State for its continued non-payment of the Outstanding Sum, that is, the strict foreign exchange controls in place in Papua New Guinea, PNGSDP argued that the State failed to explain how the policies affected the payment due. Further, the State had only said that it was “difficult” and not impossible to transfer the Outstanding Sum.

</div> The logical conclusion, it argued, was that the State could afford to pay the Outstanding Sum but was deliberately and wilfully refusing to make payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I found that there was insufficient evidence in the present case establishing that the State was deliberately and wilfully refusing to pay the Outstanding Sum, and abusing the process of the court as a result, unlike the judgment debtor in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh</span>. As mentioned above, in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Yeoh</span>, the High Court made an express finding that the judgment debtor was cherry-picking which outstanding orders of court to comply with so that she would not weaken the legal position that she was adopting in the proceedings.

In addition, no explanation was provided as to why <span class="font-italic">the State</span> would have difficulty in meeting its own foreign exchange controls. That said, these were insufficient to lead to the conclusion that the State’s continued non-payment of the Outstanding Sum was deliberate and wilful, and clearly an abuse of process of the court.

</div> PNGSDP also claimed that the State’s claims against it were “contrived” and that it had suffered prejudice as a result of having to defend the State’s claims in the consolidated proceedings. This was because of, amongst others, an interim injunction obtained by the State which prevented PNGSDP from effecting changes to its memorandum, articles of association and board of directors and which required it to regularly furnish information to the State on its assets and liabilities, pending the outcome of the litigation.

There was no connection between the State’s alleged past conduct in the consolidated proceedings and the State’s present non-payment of the Outstanding Sum. Even if I were to assume that PNGSDP’s allegations were true, the fact that the State’s claims had evolved from the time of commencement, and that it had obtained an interim injunction against PNGSDP pending the outcome of the case, did not establish abuse of process on the part of the State <span class="font-italic">for the purposes of </span><span class="font-italic">staying the State’s appeal pending its payment of costs below. </span>The situation might have been different if for instance there was evidence that the State had consistently flouted court orders and that the non-payment of the Outstanding Sum was another manifestation of its abuse of the process of the court (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Suntech</span><span class="font-italic"> Power Investment Pte Ltd v Power Solar System Co Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [2019] SGCA 52 at [51]–[52] in the context of an application to strike out a pending appeal where the appellant was in continuing breach of a court order).

The Solicitor-General could endorse one of two options on the form. The first option was to allow the judgment to be satisfied. The second option was to certify that “the State proposes to take further action in this matter and satisfaction of judgment cannot take place”.

There was, in the circumstances, no basis for me to accept PNGSDP’s allegations about the State’s likely conduct in enforcement proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In coming to my decision, I had regard to the principle established in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another appeal</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”) that raw sources of foreign law, including foreign legal codes which are admissible under s 40 read in conjunction with s 86 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”), may be adduced as evidence of the foreign law (at [55]–[58]).

</div>
</div> there was nothing on the face of the relevant provisions of the REOJA and CBAATSA cited by PNGSDP which suggested that the costs orders awarded by the High Court in this case would not be enforced in Papua New Guinea. There was no explanation on affidavit why the registration of the judgment would likely be set aside on grounds of public policy under s 5 of the REOJA. Similarly, in respect of the allegations as set out at [45(b)]–[45(e)] above, no evidence was adduced to establish that the Solicitor-General was likely to endorse that the satisfaction of the costs orders of the Singapore High Court could not take place, or that the Departmental Head responsible for finance matters would not make the relevant payment to satisfy the costs orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I was also of the view that as the State was a foreign plaintiff, it was open to PNGSDP to apply for security for its costs of the action pursuant to O 23 r 1(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court, but it had not. At the hearing before me, counsel for PNGSDP accepted that this was an option available to PNGSDP but which it had not undertaken.

Civil Appeal No 78 of 2019 (Summons No 116 of 2019)<em></em>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Woo Bih Li J):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome: Single-judge Court of Appeal dismisses respondent’s application
for stay of appeal pending appellant’s payment of costs below.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 The applicant in Summons No 116 of 2019 (“SUM 116”), PNG Sustainable
Development Program Limited (“PNGSDP”), is the respondent in the main
appeal, Civil Appeal No 78 of 2019 (“CA 78”). It succeeded before the High
Court in defending the claims brought by the Independent State of Papua New
Guinea (“the State”), and was awarded costs. The State filed CA 78 to
appeal against the High Court judge’s decision to dismiss all of its claims
against PNGSDP.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 While the main appeal was pending, PNGSDP filed SUM 116 to stay the
appeal until the State paid the costs awarded by the High Court totalling
$2,522,356.07 (the “Outstanding Sum”). PNGSDP relied principally on the
Court of Appeal’s decision in the case of
<em>
Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd and others v Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp Ltd and another
</em>
[2003] 2 SLR(R) 353 (“<em>Roberto</em>”), where it was recognised that the
appellate court has the inherent jurisdiction to stay an appeal until the
appellant paid to the respondent the costs awarded by the court below,
where the justice of the case so demanded.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3<a name="_Ref24636445"> </a>PNGSDP submitted that there were two factors which made the
circumstances of the present case exceptional such that a stay of the
appeal was justified. First, it suggested that the State was able but
simply unwilling to pay the Outstanding Sum and therefore was abusing
the process of the court in failing to comply with the costs orders.
Second, PNGSDP submitted that it would face difficulties enforcing the
various costs orders against the State because enforcement would have
to be undertaken in Papua New Guinea as the State was not within
Singapore’s jurisdiction.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 The State, on the other hand, denied PNGSDP’s allegations that it was
able but unwilling to pay the Outstanding Sum. It explained that it faced
difficulties in paying the Outstanding Sum because of strict foreign
exchange controls in place in Papua New Guinea, which made it difficult for
it to transfer large sums of foreign currency at short notice. The State
also argued that PNGSDP was seeking to stifle its right of appeal by
bringing the stay application.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The Court of Appeal’s decision </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 The Court of Appeal dismissed SUM 116. The court found that the two
allegations made by PNGSDP (see [3] above) were not made out on the
evidence. Hence, there was no basis for the stay to be granted (at    <strong>[38]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong><em>Abuse of process </em></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 The court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that
the State was deliberately and wilfully refusing to pay the Outstanding
Sum, and abusing the process of the court as a result (at [    <strong>40]</strong>). While there were some inadequacies in the evidence
given by the State on the reasons for its continued non-payment of the
Outstanding Sum, the inadequacies were insufficient to lead to the
conclusion that the State’s continued non-payment of the Outstanding Sum
was deliberate and wilful, and clearly an abuse of process of the court (at    <strong>[41]</strong>). In addition, there was also no connection between
the State’s past conduct in the proceedings below as alleged by PNGSDP, and
the State’s present non-payment of the Outstanding Sum (at    <strong>[43]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong><em>Difficulties in enforcement </em></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 The court also did not accept PNGSDP’s allegations on the difficulties it
would face in enforcing the costs orders as there was a lack of evidence to
support its allegations. While PNGSDP alleged that the State would utilise
certain provisions within the relevant Papua New Guinea legislation for
enforcement of judgments to stymie its attempts at enforcement, there was
no evidence to support its allegations (at <strong>[46]</strong>–    <strong>[48]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 The court observed that there are a number of English authorities which
suggest that the fact that the respondent is likely to face difficulties in
enforcing a judgment debt or costs order could be a compelling reason
(under the English Civil Procedure Rules) for the appeal to be stayed
pending payment of the judgment debt or costs by the appellant. The court
stated that it is uncertain if the English approach will be adopted in
Singapore, given the observation in <em>Roberto</em> that a respondent may
well face difficulties in enforcing the costs order while the appeal is
pending, but that the appellate court should not be used as a means to
enable the respondent to obtain payment of his taxed costs. Since PNGSDP
failed to adduce any evidence of the difficulties it would face in
enforcing the costs orders, it was unnecessary for the court to decide the
point. Nevertheless, the court observed that based on <em>Roberto</em>, the
mere fact that enforcement proceedings would have to be commenced overseas
against a judgment debtor is unlikely to be sufficient to constitute a
special or exceptional reason for a stay to be granted as that would result
in a stay of appeal being granted in almost all cases where the appellant
resides in a foreign country. This would undermine the general principle
that a stay of an appeal pending payment of costs below should only be
granted in special or exceptional circumstances (at <strong>[51]</strong>).
