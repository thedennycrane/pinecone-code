        V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of
                the Court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Arbitration and insolvency processes embody, to
                    an extent, contrasting legal policies. On the one hand, arbitration embodies the
                    principles of party autonomy and the decentralisation of private dispute
                    resolution. On the other hand, the insolvency process is a collective statutory
                    proceeding that involves the public centralisation of disputes so as to achieve
                    economic efficiency and optimal returns for creditors. The appeal before us
                    raised an interesting and novel point of law relating to the interfacing of
                    these two policies where private proceedings could have wider public
                    consequences. To what extent ought claims involving an insolvent company be
                    permitted to be resolved through the arbitral process? We now give the reasons
                    why we dismissed this appeal with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts of this case are relatively
                    straightforward and have been succinctly summarised by the judge at first
                    instance (“the Judge”) in his grounds of decision
                    (“GD”) in <em>Petroprod Ltd (in official
                        liquidation in the Cayman Islands and in compulsory liquidation in
                        Singapore) v Larsen Oil and Gas Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 4 SLR 501. We
                    will therefore set out here, only a broad overview of the factual background
                    that would be helpful in explaining our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The respondent, Petroprod Ltd
                    (“Petroprod”), a Cayman Islands company, and its four wholly-owned
                    subsidiaries (“the four subsidiaries”), which had no employees,
                    entered into a Management Agreement (“the MA”) with the appellant,
                    Larsen Oil and Gas Pte Ltd (“Larsen”) on 21 December 2006.
                    Pursuant to the MA, Larsen was to provide management services to Petroprod and
                    the four subsidiaries. Petroprod pleaded that as a result of the MA and
                    subsequent amendments, Larsen gained control over its finances as well as those
                    of the four subsidiaries. Petroprod also claimed to be a creditor of the four
                    subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 17 July 2009, Petroprod was placed in
                    official liquidation in the Cayman Islands by an Order of the Grand Court of the
                    Cayman Islands. It was subsequently placed in compulsory liquidation in
                    Singapore by an order of the High Court on 3 August 2009. On
                    3 September 2009, the Singapore liquidators of Petroprod commenced
                    proceedings against Larsen:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     to avoid a number of payments that
                        Petroprod made to Larsen on the ground that these payments amounted to
                        unfair preferences or transactions at an undervalue within the meaning of
                        ss 98 and 99 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed)
                        (“BA”), read with s 329(1) of the Companies Act
                        (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     to avoid a
                        number of payments made by the four subsidiaries to Larsen pursuant to
                        s 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61,
                        1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”) on the ground that they were made
                        with the intent to defraud it as a creditor of the
                    subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 2 December 2009, Larsen filed a summons
                    applying for a stay of all further proceedings brought by Petroprod pursuant to
                    s 6(2) of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“AA”). The basis of its application was that an arbitration
                    clause (cl 18) in the MA (“the Arbitration Clause”) required
                    the parties to resolve their disputes through arbitration. The Arbitration
                    Clause reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and
                        governed by the laws of Singapore. Disputes which cannot be resolved
                        amicably shall be resolved by arbitration in Singapore in accordance with
                        the provisions of the Singapore Arbitration Act, Chapter 10.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Larsen’s application for a stay of further proceedings was heard
                    by the Judge on 26 March 2010, and judgment was given together with the GD
                    on 30 June 2010. The Judge dismissed Larsen’s stay application on the
                    basis that the issues were (a) non-arbitrable; and, further, that
                    (b) Petropod’s claim pertaining to s 73B CLPA should be resolved
                    in the same forum (see GD at [22] and
                        [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues arising in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The issues that arose in the appeal were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether Petroprod’s claims
                        against Larsen fell within the scope of the Arbitration
                    Clause;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the
                        Court’s discretion to grant a stay of proceedings pursuant to
                        s 6(2) of the AA was dependent on the arbitrability of the dispute in
                        question;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     if the
                        Court’s discretion was dependent on the arbitrability of the dispute,
                        whether Petroprod’s claims against Larsen were
                    arbitrable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The scope of the Arbitration Clause</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The proper characterisation of Petroprod’s claims against
                Larsen</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Larsen contended that Petroprod’s claims
                    against it were founded on Larsen’s alleged breach of the MA, and that
                    such a claim fell within the scope of the Arbitration Clause. It claimed that
                    Petroprod could only show that the payments made to Larsen by Petroprod and the
                    four subsidiaries were preferential payments by relying on the terms of the MA,
                    and proving that the payments were made with the intent to prefer Larsen over
                    the other creditors rather than in accordance with the MA. As a corollary,
                    Larsen also argued that Petroprod could only show that the payments made to
                    Larsen by Petroprod and the four subsidiaries were undervalue
                    transactions/fraudulent conveyances if the amounts paid were more than what
                    Petroprod (and the four subsidiaries) were obliged to pay under the MA.
                    Therefore, all of Petroprod’s claims were intimately connected to the MA
                    and any disputes relating to the payments under the MA fell within the scope of
                    the Arbitration Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Judge rejected Larsen’s arguments. He
                    held at [16] of the GD that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he rights created by the avoidance provisions exist for the benefit of
                        the general body of creditors in an insolvency or insolvency-related
                        context. This is why avoidance rights may be exercised even if the relevant
                        transaction is binding under general law on the company. It is also
                        pertinent to note that undervalue transactions and undue preferences can be
                        avoided only when the company is being wound up. In my view, the policy
                        underlying the avoidance provisions in question would be compromised if
                        their enforcement is subject to private arrangements, including an agreement
                        to arbitrate, between the company and the wrongfully advantaged creditor or
                        transferee. In this regard, a company’s rights under the avoidance
                        provisions should be contrasted with its rights under the general
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       We agreed with the Judge’s
                    characterisation of Petroprod’s claims against Larsen. Petroprod’s
                    Statement of Claim against Larsen revealed that Petroprod did not allege that
                    Larsen had breached the MA by causing Petroprod to make the payments to Larsen.
                    Rather, all that Petroprod claimed was that it had made certain payments to
                    Larsen within two years of its insolvency, and that the law presumed that the
                    payments were made with an intention to prefer Larsen as a creditor because of
                    Larsen’s control over the management of Petroprod. Similarly,
                    Petroprod’s claims against Larsen based on an undervalued transaction and
                    a fraudulent conveyance were entirely independent of the question of whether
                    Larsen had breached the MA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In our opinion, Petroprod’s claims
                    against Larsen were founded entirely on the avoidance provisions of the BA and
                    Companies Act. <em>The focus of these avoidance provisions is to
                        address situations where value has been subtracted from the insolvent
                        company to the detriment of the general creditors, independent of the nature
                        of the relationship between the parties</em>. These provisions allow
                    for the adjustment of concluded transactions upon the onset of insolvency. The
                    only relevance of the MA to Petroprod’s claims against Larsen was that it
                    provided some evidence that the payments made from Petroprod to Larsen could
                    have been for some legitimate commercial reason other than to prefer Larsen as a
                    creditor. The question of whether Larsen had committed a breach of the MA by
                    causing Petroprod to make those payments was irrelevant. Accordingly, we
                    rejected Larsen’s claim that Petroprod’s claims were pure
                    contractual claims merely because of the MA. Rather, we found that
                    Petroprod’s claims against Larsen were avoidance claims that sprung from
                    the special regime created by the BA and Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The proper approach towards the construction of arbitration
                clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Of course, the mere fact that
                    Petroprod’s claims against Larsen were avoidance claims did not preclude
                    them from falling within the scope of the Arbitration Clause. The scope of any
                    arbitration clause is based on the parties’ expressed intention, and it is
                    conceivable that the parties to a contract may agree that all disputes between
                    them, including disputes arising out of avoidance actions in the event of
                    insolvency, should fall within the scope of the arbitration clause. This would
                    be a matter of documentary construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The traditional approach of the English courts
                    was to determine the scope of an arbitration clause by looking at the precise
                    words used in it. Hence, the use of expansive words such as “any
                    dispute” between the parties were often regarded as wide enough to
                    include any matter related to the contract, even if the action brought was based
                    in tort (see generally <em>Astro Vencedor Compania Naviera SA of
                        Panama v. Mabanaft GmbH, The Damianos</em> [1971] 2 QB 588). On
                    the other hand, words such as “arising under the contract” were
                    held to be of narrower scope, and there was a divergence of views between courts
                    as to whether such a clause could include a tort claim that was related to the
                    contract (see <em>Heyman and another v Darwins,
                        Limited</em> [1942] AC 356; <em>Union of India v EB
                        Aaby’s Rederi A/s, The Evje</em> [1974] 2 All ER
                    874).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The case of <em>Premium Nafta
                        Products Ltd &amp; Ors v Fili Shipping Co Ltd &amp; Ors</em> [2007]
                    2 CLC 553 (“<em>Premium Nafta</em>”)
                    heralded a change in how arbitration clauses ought to be construed. The dispute
                    in that case was whether an arbitration clause that purported to cover
                    “any dispute arising under this charter” was wide enough to cover
                    claims involving the tort of conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud,
                        <em>etc</em>. The House of Lords eschewed the
                    traditional technical approach towards the construction of arbitration clauses
                    in favour of a commonsensical one based on the presumed intention of the
                    parties. Lord Hoffman with his customary acuity noted (at [13]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he construction of an arbitration clause should start from the
                        assumption that the parties, as rational businessmen, are likely to have
                        intended any dispute arising out of the relationship into which they have
                        entered or purported to enter to be decided by the same tribunal. The clause
                        should be construed in accordance with this presumption unless the language
                        makes it clear that certain questions were intended to be excluded from the
                        arbitrator's jurisdiction.</p>

                        Nafta</em> approach suggests that an arbitration clause should be
                    construed widely so as to include all disputes relating to the contract, whether
                    the underlying cause of action is based on tort or contract, unless the language
                    used in the arbitration clause clearly excludes the particular
                dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Other jurisdictions have also favoured a
                    generous approach towards the construction of arbitration clauses. The Supreme
                    Court of the United States has taken the view that “any doubts concerning
                    the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of
                    arbitration” (see <em>Moses H Cone Memorial Hospital
                        v Mercury Construction Corporation</em> 460 US 1 (1983) at
                        [12]-[14]). Further, in <em>Mitsubishi Motors
                        Corporation v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc</em> 473 US 614
                    (1985), Blackmun J held (at [2]–[3]) that with
                    regard to the construction of an arbitration clause, “as with any other
                    contract, the parties' intentions control, but those intentions are generously
                    construed as to issues of arbitrability”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In <em>Francis Travel Marketing
                        Pty Ltd v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd</em> [1996] 39 NSWLR 160,
                    the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales had to consider
                    whether an arbitration clause was wide enough to cover a claim by the plaintiff
                    under the Australian Trade Practices Act 1974. The court, in holding that the
                    arbitration clause should be generously interpreted to include such claims,
                    reasoned (at 165) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the parties to a commercial contract agree, at the time of making the
                        contract, and before any disputes have yet arisen, to refer to arbitration
                        any dispute or difference arising out of the agreement, their agreement
                        should not be construed narrowly. They are unlikely to have intended that
                        different disputes should be resolved before different tribunals, or that
                        the appropriate tribunal should be determined by fine shades of difference
                        in the legal character of individual issues, or by the ingenuity of lawyers
                        in developing points of argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Similarly, in <em>Onex Corp. v.
                        Ball Corp</em>. (1994) 12 BLR (2d) 151 at [24], the Ontario Court of Justice reasoned
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here the language of an arbitration clause is capable of bearing two
                        interpretations, and on one of those interpretations fairly provides for
                        arbitration, the courts should lean towards honouring that option
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This approach was cited with approval by the Ontario Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Canadian National Railway Co et al v Lovat Tunnel
                        Equipment Inc</em> (1999) 174 D.L.R. (4th) 385.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     This generous approach towards the
                    construction of the scope of arbitration clauses has received widespread
                    support. Gary Born concludes that such an approach “best achieves the
                    parties’ objective, good faith intentions” (Gary B Born,
                        <em>International Commercial Arbitration
                        vol 1</em> (Wolters Kluwer, 2009) at p 1083). Other writers
                    such as Julian Lew, Loukas Mistelis and Stefan Kroll also support this approach
                    on the grounds that restrictive interpretations of arbitration clauses tend to
                    cause “cumbersome” and unfair results (see
                    Julian D M Lew et al, <em>Comparative
                        International Commercial Arbitration</em> (Kluwer Law Internationa,
                    2003) at p 152).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There are, all in all, strong reasons for
                    supporting a generous approach towards the construction of the scope of
                    arbitration clauses, given that such an approach has received widespread
                    acceptance among the leading commercial jurisdictions, and is strongly supported
                    by the academic community. Such an approach is also consistent with this
                    court’s philosophy of facilitating arbitration (see, for instance, the
                    case of <em>Tjong Very Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 where we adopted a
                    generous interpretation of the word “dispute” in an arbitration
                    clause). Accordingly, we agree that the preponderance of authority favours the
                    view that arbitration clauses should be generously construed such that all
                    manner of claims, whether common law or statutory, should be regarded as falling
                    within their scope unless there is good reason to conclude
                otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Arbitration Clause covered Petroprod’s avoidance
                claims against Larsen</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The underlying basis for a generous approach
                    towards construing the scope of an arbitration clause is the assumption that
                    commercial parties, as rational business entities, are likely to prefer a
                    dispute resolution system that can deal with all types of claims in a single
                    forum. This assumption is reasonable in relation to private remedial claims,
                    which may arise either before or during the period when a company becomes
                    insolvent. It is conceivable that the company’s pre-insolvency management
                    would prefer all these claims to be dealt with in a single forum. However, this
                    reasoning cannot be applied to avoidance claims pursued during insolvency
                    proceedings. The commencement of insolvency proceedings results in the
                    company’s management being displaced by a liquidator or judicial manager.
                    Since avoidance claims can only be pursued by the liquidators or judicial
                    managers of insolvent companies, there is no reason to objectively believe that
                    a company’s pre-insolvency management would ordinarily contemplate
                    including avoidance claims within the scope of an arbitration
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     For the reasons stated above, it makes sense
                    to draw a line between private remedial claims (either common law or statutory),
                    which the company’s pre-insolvency management have good reason to be
                    concerned about, and claims that can only be made by a liquidator/judicial
                    manager of an insolvent company, to which they are completely indifferent. We
                    therefore hold that arbitration clauses should not ordinarily be construed to
                    cover avoidance claims in the absence of express language to the contrary (on
                    this issue see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> below) and that the
                    Arbitration Clause did not cover Petroprod’s claims against
                Larsen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Our holding that the Arbitration Clause did
                    not cover Petroprod’s claims against Larsen would have been enough to
                    dismiss the appeal. However, in the light of the fact that the question of the
                    arbitrability of insolvency-related claims has never been raised in the local
                    courts, and would certainly be of great importance to arbitration and insolvency
                    practitioners, we consider it appropriate for us to explicate our views on what
                    would be the proper judicial approach towards an arbitration agreement that
                    expressly includes insolvency-related claims such as avoidance
                claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The concept of arbitrability and s 6(2) of the AA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before the Judge, the parties did not address
                    the question of whether the concept of arbitrability of the claim should be a
                    factor when a court is considering whether to grant a stay of proceedings in
                    favour of arbitration under s 6(2) of the AA. However, the Judge correctly
                    identified this as an important issue, and held that although the AA did not
                    make any explicit reference to the concept of arbitrability, this should be
                    taken into account when a court is asked to exercise its discretion to grant a
                    stay of proceedings under s 6(2) of the AA. He stated, at [12] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the IAA, the concept of arbitrability is recognised in s 11(1),
                        which provides that any dispute which the parties have agreed to submit to
                        arbitration under an arbitration agreement may be determined by arbitration
                        unless it is contrary to public policy to do so. In contrast, there is no
                        explicit reference to the concept of arbitrability in the Arbitration Act.
                        Even so, this concept ought to be taken into account when a court is asked
                        to exercise its discretion to grant a stay under s 6(2) of the
                        Arbitration Act. With this in mind, the specific nature of Petroprod’s
                        claims in the main action will now be considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     We agree with the Judge’s view that
                    arbitrability is an important factor that ought to be taken into consideration
                    when determining whether to grant a stay under s 6(2) of the AA. However,
                    the Judge’s observation that the AA does not make explicit reference to
                    the concept of arbitrability is incorrect. Section 48(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the AA, which deals with the setting aside of an
                    arbitral award, makes it clear that the courts can set aside an arbitral award
                    if “the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by
                    arbitration.” This is a clear reference to the concept of arbitrability.
                    However, the AA does not include any provision that explains what disputes are
                    arbitrable. It has been left to the courts to shape the contours of the
                    arbitrability exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In our opinion, there are two reasons why a
                    stay should not be granted under s 6(2) of the AA if the claim is not an
                    arbitrable one. First, as the Judge pointed out, s 11(1) of the
                    International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“IAA”) explicitly states that parties may only agree to submit a
                    dispute to arbitration if the dispute is an arbitrable one. It would be
                    anomalous if a dispute that was non-arbitrable and hence not entitled to a stay
                    of proceedings under the IAA, could be stayed in favour of arbitration under
                    s 6(2) of the AA. The anomaly is even more striking considering that the
                    Courts are expected to take a more interventionist approach in domestic
                    arbitrations under the AA than international arbitrations under the IAA (see
                        <em>NCC International AB v Alliance Concrete
                        Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 565 at [51]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Second, it is important to remember that
                    arbitration is not an end in itself. Parties engage in arbitration in order to
                    obtain an arbitral award that can be enforced. An arbitral award in respect of
                    an non-arbitrable claim is a <em>brutum fulmen</em> as it
                    can be set aside under s 48(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) of the
                    AA even if the issue of arbitrability is not raised by the parties. It is an
                    utter waste of time for parties to incur time and cost through arbitration, only
                    to obtain an arbitral award that is later set aside for non-arbitrability, and
                    to have the entire litigation process repeated again to have their dispute
                    sorted out. Accordingly, even though s 6(2) of the AA does not make
                    arbitrability of the dispute a pre-condition for the grant of a stay of
                    proceedings, it cannot be seriously argued that a non-arbitrable claim should be
                    allowed to proceed to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether avoidance claims are arbitrable</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The question of whether avoidance claims are
                    arbitrable cannot be answered without a proper understanding of the relationship
                    between the concept of arbitrability and the essential principles of
                    insolvency/bankruptcy law. Guidance can also be obtained from the provisions of
                    the BA and the AA (and the IAA) to understand how Parliament has struck a
                    balance between the competing policy considerations of facilitating arbitration
                    and enforcing insolvency law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The AA and the IAA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The AA makes only one reference to the concept
                    of arbitrability in s 48(1)(<em>b</em>)(i), which
                    deals with the setting aside of an arbitral award. As for the IAA, the concept
                    of arbitrability is mentioned twice, first in s 11, which deals with the
                    enforcement of an arbitration agreement, and in s 31(4), which deals with
                    the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award. Neither statute provides any
                    guidelines as to the type of claims that are arbitrable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Nevertheless, the legislative history of the
                    AA and the IAA provides some clues as to how the drafters of the statutes viewed
                    the concept of arbitrability. In 1997, the Attorney-General set up a Review of
                    Arbitration Act Committee (“the Committee”) to review arbitration
                    legislation in Singapore. In 2000, the Committee published its final report,
                        <em>Review of Arbitration Laws, LRRD
                        No 3/2001</em> (“the Report”) as well as the draft
                    Arbitration Bill 2001. Section 2.37.17 of the Report states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 48(1)(b) gives to the Court on its own motion the power to
                        refuse enforcement of the award if the subject matter in dispute is not
                        arbitrable. Subject matter arbitrability has a direct impact on the
                        jurisdiction of the tribunal and is also arguably a matter of public policy
                        as to which subject matters are incapable of arbitral resolution. <em>It is generally accepted that issues, which may have public
                            interest elements, may not be arbitrable</em>, e.g., citizenship
                        or legitimacy of marriage, grants of statutory licenses, validity of
                        registration of trade marks or patents, copyrights, <em>winding-up of companies, bankruptcies of debtors</em>,
                        administration of estates. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Report also makes it clear that the policy of encouraging
                    arbitration as encapsulated in the AA is subject to other competing policy
                    considerations, especially insolvency and bankruptcy issues. Section 2.3.3 of
                    the Report states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bill makes no reference to the insolvency of companies or other bodies
                        corporate. Reference must be made to the Companies Act and other relevant
                        statutory instruments relating to the capacities of such bodies in cases of
                        winding-up or insolvency. [The Law Reform and Co-ordinating
                        Committee’s] suggestion that the Companies Act be mentioned in the
                        Bill was not adopted as we felt that such matters should properly remain
                        within the Companies Act or for that matter any subsequent insolvency
                        legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It can be seen from the Report that the
                    drafters of the AA and IAA regarded the question of arbitrability as being
                    subject to public interest considerations. More importantly, they recognised
                    that insolvency/bankruptcy law is an area replete with public policy
                    considerations that were too important to be settled by parties privately
                    through the arbitral mechanism. However, the Report did not clarify what type of
                    claims relating to insolvency could not be arbitrated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The BA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The relevant section of the BA that deals with
                    enforcement of an arbitration agreement by/against a bankrupt party is
                    s 148A which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Section 148A of the BA is as a relatively
                    new provision. It originally appeared as s 5 of the AA until 2001, when
                    Parliament decided to re-enact this provision in the BA pursuant to the earlier
                    mentioned reforms to the AA. The parliamentary debates do not reveal the
                    legislature’s reasons for doing so, but it is likely that this was done to
                    ensure that the new s 148A of the BA could apply to arbitration agreements under
                    both the AA or the IAA, thus creating a unified scheme for the enforcement of an
                    arbitration agreements by/against bankrupt parties. (See <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, Official Report (5 October
                    2001) vol 73 at cols 2213–2218)

                Law)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It bears mention that the re-enactment of the
                    old s 5 of the AA as the present s 148A of the BA was accompanied by
                    significant textual changes. The old s 5 of the AA contained only two
                    sub-sections and read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Provisions in case of bankruptcy</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5</b>. —(1) Where it is provided by a
                        term in a contract to which a bankrupt is a party that any differences
                        arising thereout or in connection therewith shall be referred to
                        arbitration, the said term shall, if the Official Assignee of debtor’s
                        estates adopts the contract, be enforceable by or against him so far as it
                        relates to any such differences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Where a person who has been adjudged bankrupt had,
                            before the commencement of the bankruptcy, become a party to an
                            arbitration agreement, and any matter to which the agreement applies
                            requires to be determined in connection with or for the purposes of the
                            bankruptcy proceedings, then, if the case is one to which subsection (1)
                            does not apply, any other party to the agreement or the Official
                            Assignee of debtors’ estates may apply to the court having
                            jurisdiction in the bankruptcy proceedings for an order directing that
                            the matter in question shall be referred to arbitration in accordance
                            with the agreement, and that court may, if it is of opinion that, having
                            regard to all the circumstances of the case, the matter ought to be
                            determined by arbitration, make an order accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Given the substantial textual differences
                    between these two provisions, it is inappropriate to interpret s 148A(2) of
                    the BA by reference to the original s 5 of the AA. In any event, there are
                    no reported cases that deal with the application of s 5 of the AA. Neither
                    does it appear that there are any reported authorities on the United
                    Kingdom’s equivalent of the original s 5 of the AA (the original
                    s 5 of the AA was based on, and is <em>pari
                        materia</em> with, s 3 of the United Kingdom’s Arbitration
                    Act 1950 (14 Geo. 6, c.27), as well as its progenitor, s 2 of the
                    United Kingdom’s Arbitration Act 1934 (24 &amp; 25 Geo. 5, Ch.14)).
                    Therefore, we will interpret s 148(2) of the BA according to legal
                    principles as tempered by public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Section 148A contains two main sub-limbs.
                    The first sub-limb deals with a situation where the Official Assignee chooses to
                    adopt the contract, while the second sub-limb deals with a situation where the
                    Official Assignee chooses not to do so. In relation to the first sub-limb,
                    s 148A(2) provides that if the Official Assignee adopts the contract, the
                    arbitration agreement shall be enforceable by or against the Official Assignee
                    in relation to matters arising from or connected with the contract. The purpose
                    of this section is to compel the Official Assignee (or Liquidator) to adopt the
                    contract in its entirety, without having the power to cherry pick the desirable
                    portions of the contract while eschewing or discarding the undesirable parts. In
                    relation to the second sub-limb, s 148A(3) of the BA provides that even if
                    the Official Assignee (or Liquidator) does not adopt the contract, the courts
                    retain a residual discretion to refer a dispute involving an insolvent/bankrupt
                    party to arbitration if the court “thinks fit in all the circumstances of
                    the case.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Section 148A does not provide any clear
                    guidelines for determining how the court should exercise its residual discretion
                    in deciding whether a claim involving an insolvent party should be referred to
                    arbitration when the underlying contract is not adopted. Neither does it provide
                    any clues as to how to determine if a particular claim is arbitrable. These are
                    areas that have been left for the courts to decide.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Case law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     
          <em>Four Pillars Enterprises Co
                        Ltd v Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft</em>
                    [1999] 1 SLR(R) 382 (“<em>Four
                        Pillars</em>”) is the only local case that deals directly with
                    the question of whether an insolvency related dispute can be arbitrated. In that
                    case, the appellant and the respondent had set up a joint venture company (JVC)
                    pursuant to a joint venture agreement. In 1998, the respondent, as creditor and
                    shareholder of the JVC, presented a petition to wind up the JVC on grounds that
                    the JVC was insolvent and that it was just and equitable that the JVC be wound
                    up. The appellant sought an order for a stay of the winding-up proceedings on
                    the basis that the joint-venture agreement contained an arbitration clause
                    requiring the respondent to refer all disputes to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     This Court found that the winding up petition
                    did not fall within the scope of the arbitration clause and refused to grant the
                    stay sought by the appellants. <em>Four Pillars</em>,
                    however, does not provide us with much help on the question of the arbitrability
                    of insolvency related disputes because that case was dealt with primarily as a
                    question dealing with the construction of the scope of an arbitration
                    clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   England</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There are no direct English authorities on
                    whether an avoidance claim is arbitrable. The respondent cited the case of
                        <em>Exeter City Association Football Club Ltd v Football
                        Conference Ltd and another</em> [2004] 1 WLR 2910
                        (“<em>Exeter City</em>”) at [23] as standing for the proposition that
                    there are certain statutory rights that are “inalienable and cannot be
                    diminished or removed by contract or otherwise”. In that case, the court
                    held that an action under s 459 of the English Companies Act that the
                    company’s affairs were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to the
                    shareholder’s interest was non-arbitrable. In our opinion, <em>Exeter City</em> is not a useful case because it merely
                    states that certain statutory rights are non-arbitrable, without giving any
                    guidelines as to how this determination is even made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On a more general note, s 130(2) of the
                    UK Insolvency Act 1986 provides that no proceedings shall be proceeded with or
                    commenced against an insolvent company except with the leave of court. The
                    English courts have interpreted this provision as applying to arbitral
                    proceedings as well (see <em>Enron Metals &amp; Commodity Limited
                        v HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Limited</em> [2005] EWHC 485
                    (Ch)). In <em>In re Atlantic Computer Systems Plc</em>
                    [1992] 2 WLR 367 (“<em>Re
                    Atlantic</em>”), the Court of Appeal held that the stay should only
                    be lifted if the creditor could make out a good case against the insolvent
                    debtor. Where the creditor’s claim did not relate to proprietary rights,
                    the court had to conduct a balancing exercise between the interest of the
                    claimant in exercising its rights, and those of the other creditors. In doing
                    so, the court had to consider the loss that the creditor would suffer if leave
                    was not granted, compared with the loss potentially suffered by the other
                    creditors if leave was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The <em>Re Atlantic</em>
                    approach requires the judge to conduct a balancing exercise between the interest
                    of the particular claimant in enforcing the arbitration clause, and those of the
                    other creditors. Under this approach, an English court may enforce an
                    arbitration clause if it is of the opinion that the interest of the particular
                    claimant in enforcing the arbitration clause outweighs the interest of the other
                    creditors in resisting such enforcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Australia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The arbitrability of avoidance claims was the
                    subject of discussion in <em>New Cap Reinsurance Corporation
                        Limited v A E Grant &amp; Ors, Lloyd's Syndicate
                        No 991</em> [2009] NSWSC 662 (“<em>New Cap
                        Reinsurance</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff company had
                    brought an avoidance action against the defendants to recover certain payments
                    made to it, on the grounds that these payments were unfair preferences under the
                    Australian Corporations Act 2001. The defendants objected to having these claims
                    litigated in court on the basis that they fell within the scope of an
                    arbitration agreement between the parties. Barret J held that the scope of
                    the arbitration clause could not include an avoidance claim brought by the
                    plaintiff against the defendants (at [87]–[88]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[E]ven on the most generous interpretation of the words “[a]ll
                        matters in difference between the parties arising under, out of or in
                        connection with this Reinsurance”, they do not extend to the present
                        proceeding under s 588FF(1) of the <em>Corporations
                            Act</em> in which the liquidator of one party to the reinsurance
                        contract seeks an order for the payment of money to that contracting party
                        by the other contracting party. This proceeding has nothing to do with the
                        reinsurance contract. It is a proceeding upon a statutory cause of action
                        maintainable by the liquidator of one of the former contracting parties.
                            <em>The cause of action is not available to the
                            contracting party itself. Its liquidator, when suing upon the statutory
                            cause of action, does not attempt to enforce some right of the
                            contracting party</em>. Furthermore, the event giving rise to the
                        proceeding is not anything done under, by reference to or in relation to the
                        reinsurance contract. The relevant event is the making of a payment by one
                        of the parties to the reinsurance contract to the other of them pursuant to
                        a new and separate contact by which they agreed to compromise and release
                        the rights and obligations created by the reinsurance contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In summary, the “matters in difference” in these present
                        proceedings are matters between NCRA’s liquidator and the defendants.
                        They are matters arising from events that happened after the agreed
                        termination of the reinsurance contract and, following the commencement of
                        NCRA’s winding up, caused a statutory cause of action to become vested
                        in the liquidator. <em>There was no cause of action and no
                            claim upon the defendants until the winding up of NCRA
                            intervened</em>. The arbitration provision in the reinsurance
                        contract – which ceased to be in force between NCRA and the defendants
                        when, in December 1998, they became parties to the commutation agreement
                        – has no bearing on the statutory right that the subsequently
                        appointed liquidator of NCRA subsequently acquired to seek orders against
                        the defendants under s 588FF(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Barret J’s judgment in <em>New Cap Reinsurance</em> appears to conflate the question of
                    arbitrability, which deals with the question of whether a particular type of
                    claim can be arbitrated, with the question of the scope of the arbitration
                    clause, which is essentially an issue of construction. We are unable to agree
                    with this approach because we regard these issues as being conceptually
                    separate. Despite this, Barret J’s insightful analysis that the scope
                    of the arbitration clause could not include the plaintiff’s avoidance
                    claims, because they were only available to the liquidator of the company upon
                    the commencement of insolvency, seems to us to be a practical approach in
                    evaluating the kind of claims that ought not to be arbitrable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The concept of non-arbitrability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The concept of non-arbitrability is a
                    cornerstone of the process of arbitration. It allows the courts to refuse to
                    enforce an otherwise valid arbitration agreement on policy grounds. That said,
                    we accept that there is ordinarily a presumption of arbitrability where the
                    words of an arbitration clause are wide enough to embrace a dispute, unless it
                    is shown that parliament intended to preclude the use of arbitration for the
                    particular type of dispute in question (as evidenced by the statute’s text
                    or legislative history), or that there is an inherent conflict between
                    arbitration and the public policy considerations involved in that particular
                    type of dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disputes involving an insolvent company due to the operation of the
                insolvency regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     A distinction should be drawn between disputes
                    involving an insolvent company that stem from its pre-insolvency rights and
                    obligations, and those that arise only upon the onset of insolvency due to the
                    operation of the insolvency regime. Many of the statutory provisions in the
                    insolvency regime are in place to recoup for the benefit of the company’s
                    creditors losses caused by the misfeasance and/or malfeasance of its former
                    management. This is especially true of the avoidance and wrongful trading
                    provisions. This objective could be compromised if a company’s
                    pre-insolvency management had the ability to restrict the avenues by which the
                    company’s creditors could enforce the very statutory remedies which were
                    meant to protect them against the company’s management. It is a not
                    unimportant consideration that some of these remedies may include claims against
                    former management who would not be parties to any arbitration agreement. The
                    need to avoid different findings by different adjudicators is another reason why
                    a collective enforcement procedure is clearly in the wider public
                    interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We, therefore, are of the opinion that the
                    insolvency regime’s objective of facilitating claims by a company’s
                    creditors against the company and its pre-insolvency management overrides the
                    freedom of the company’s pre-insolvency management to choose the forum
                    where such disputes are to be heard. The courts should treat disputes arising
                    from the operation of the statutory provisions of the insolvency regime
                        <em>per se</em> as non-arbitrable even if the parties
                    expressly included them within the scope of the arbitration
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disputes involving an insolvent company that stem from its
                pre-insolvency rights and obligations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On the other hand, different considerations
                    apply in relation to disputes involving an insolvent company that stem from its
                    pre-insolvency rights and obligations. These disputes are binding on liquidators
                    who, although not parties to such agreements, have stepped into the shoes of the
                    company on liquidation. Such disputes differ from those arising on the onset of
                    insolvency because they do not involve public policy considerations such as the
                    protection of creditors. Nonetheless, there are other policy issues that may
                    militate against giving effect to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     First, compelling parties to arbitrate
                    inevitably deprives them of their fundamental right of access to the courts.
                    Such deprivation can only be justified if the parties who are compelled to
                    arbitrate had previously consented to waiving their right to judicial remedies
                    in lieu of arbitration. Thus, non parties to an arbitration agreement cannot be
                    compelled to arbitrate their disputes pursuant to an arbitration agreement. When
                    a company becomes insolvent, its assets are impressed with a statutory trust
                    that is administered by the liquidator for the benefit of the company’s
                    creditors (see <em>Ng Wei Teck Michael and others v
                        Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 778). That
                    being so, the creditors of the insolvent company are the parties with the real
                    interest in any dispute that involves the insolvent company, since they are the
                    ones who stand to lose or gain from any diminution or augmentation of the
                    company’s assets. Since these creditors are not parties to the arbitration
                    agreement between the insolvent company and its arbitral counterparties, it is
                    very hard to justify why the liquidator (who represents the creditors) should be
                    compelled to give up its rights to judicial remedies in favour of
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Second, there is a well established principle
                    that a company cannot contract with some of its creditors for the
                    non-application of certain insolvency rules (see generally <em>Joo Yee Construction v Diethelm Industries</em> [1990] 2 MLJ 66;
                        <em>National Westminster Bank Ltd. v. Halesowen Presswork
                        &amp; Assemblies Ltd</em>. [1972] AC 785; <em>British
                        Eagle International Air Lines Ltd. v Compagnie Nationale Air
                        France</em> [1975] 1 WLR 758). The Companies (Winding Up) Rules
                    (Cap 50, Rule 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CR”) creates a
                    highly specialised form of dispute resolution in respect of claims brought
                    against an insolvent party. Under the CR, every creditor is required to submit a
                    proof of debt to the liquidator (r 78), and all costs relating to the
                    proving of debts are to be borne by the creditor (r 84). The liquidator may
                    admit or reject the proof or may require further evidence to be taken
                    (r 92). If dissatisfied with the liquidator’s decision, a creditor
                    may apply to the Court to reverse or vary the liquidator’s decision
                    (r 93). Arguably, allowing an insolvent company’s creditor to
                    arbitrate a dispute against the company falls foul of this principle, since that
                    creditor is in effect contracting out of the proof of debt
                process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In our view, such agreements should not be
                    allowed to be enforced against the liquidator where the agreement affects the
                    substantive rights of other creditors. Otherwise it will undermine the policy
                    aims of the insolvency regime. In <em>Re Rasmachayana Sulistyo
                        (alias Chang Whe Ming), ex parte The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd
                        and other appeals</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 483, the High Court had
                    the opportunity to consider whether a pre-bankruptcy agreement between a debtor
                    and its creditor on service of process for court proceedings amounted to an
                    improper contracting out of the service provisions of the Bankruptcy Rules
                    (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“BR”), and held that
                    the agreement was enforceable (at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is nothing in the BR or BA pointing to the existence of a
                        legislative scheme for an exclusive code of procedure for personal service.
                        More importantly, there is nothing in the BR that precludes or militates
                        against consensual arrangements for service of processes. <em>In my view, the freedom to contract should not be fettered unless there
                            is a clear contrary indication from the language used or from the
                            purport of the relevant legislative provisions and/or underpinning
                            public interest considerations</em>. The objectives of insolvency
                        legislation will continue to be well served by sanctioning agreements
                        between competent contracting parties on personal issues such as the
                        modalities of service and notice. The principal purposes of such legislation
                        are to prevent fragmentation of assets and to sterilise certain legal rights
                        of an insolvent debtor and these objectives are clearly not contravened or
                        impeded by consensual arrangements on such issues. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     However, in instances where the agreement is
                    only to resolve the prior private <em>inter se</em>
                    disputes between the company and another party there will usually be no good
                    reason not to observe the terms of the arbitration agreement. The proof of debt
                    process is merely a substituted means of enforcing debts against the company,
                    and does not create new rights in the creditors or destroy old ones (see
                        <em>Wight and others v Eckhardt Marine GmbH</em> [2004]
                    1 AC 147). Hence, even if the claim is subsequently proved to be valid and
                    enforceable against the liquidator, the pool of assets available to all
                    creditors at the time of the liquidation of the company is not affected. For the
                    same reason, allowing a creditor to arbitrate his claim against an insolvent
                    company in such circumstances does not undermine the insolvency regime’s
                    underlying policy aims.</p>

                    creditor of the four subsidiaries. The essence of these claims lies in the fact
                    that Larsen caused the four subsidiaries to have made payments to itself when
                    they were already insolvent, thus causing prejudice to Petroprod.

                        Co Pte Ltd</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 637 (“<em>Quah Kay Tee</em>”), this Court had the opportunity to
                    consider the nature of s 73B of the CLPA in some detail. Lai Kew
                    Chai J, who delivered the decision of the Court, traced the history of
                    s 73B of the CLPA as being derived from s 172 of the English Law of
                    Property Act 1925 (c 20), which in turn was based on the Statute of
                    Elizabeth 1571 (c 5). The court held that s 73B of the CLPA was not
                    directed merely against transfers of property that are made with the express
                    intention of defrauding creditors, but also covered situations of constructive
                    fraud. Furthermore, the very idea of constructive fraud was intrinsically
                    connected to the insolvent/bankrupt status of the debtor (at [25]–[26] and [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    It is apparent from a trilogy of cases decided by
                            Lord Hardwicke LC that "indebtedness" at the time of the
                            voluntary conveyance is the all important criterion in invoking
                            constructive fraud and thereby holding a transaction void. In <em>Townshend v Windham</em> (1750) 2 Ves Sen 1 at
                            10; 28 ER 1, his Lordship stated, “the testator being
                            indebted at the time of the appointment, it is void as against his
                            creditors”; and in <em>Russell v
                                Hammond</em> (1738) 1 Atk 13 at 15; 26 ER 9, he
                            observed that the only voluntary settlements which are not fraudulent
                            are those "where the person making, is not indebted at the time"; and in
                                <em>Walker v Burrows</em> (1745) 1 Atk 93
                            at 94; 26 ER 61, he spoke of indebtedness at the time, or soon
                            after, as a circumstance from which a fraudulent intention might be
                            collected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    These decisions lay down the one great object of
                            the Elizabethan Statute, which is to prevent debtors from dealing with
                            their property in any way to the prejudice of their creditors. It in
                            fact considers a man deeply indebted as no longer the true owner of his
                            property but rather, a trustee of it for the benefit of his creditors.
                            Therefore, the statute gives priority to debts over voluntary and
                            fraudulent conveyances and attempts to prevent a man in his lifetime
                            from delaying, hindering or defrauding his just creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    Thus, actual insolvency is not always necessary.
                            Neither is the mere existence of some indebtedness, at the time of the
                            gift, sufficient to invalidate the voluntary transaction. <em>But if it can be proved that the donor, at the time he made
                                the gift, was indebted to the extent of insolvency, or that he
                                became so by the abstraction of the property comprised in the gift,
                                then that is enough to invalidate the transfer
                            …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Therefore, properly understood, a s 73B
                    CLPA claim is one that may straddle both a company’s pre-insolvency state
                    of affairs, as well as its descent into the insolvency regime. For example, a
                    debtor may try to dissipate its local assets in anticipation of a creditor
                    obtaining judgment against him. The debtor may have other foreign assets such
                    that it remains solvent even after such dissipation, the only problem being the
                    creditor’s ability to enforce its judgment debt against the debtor in
                    those foreign jurisdictions. In such a case, a s 73B CLPA claim commenced
                    by the creditor has nothing to do with the insolvency regime. It is simply an
                    allegation that the debtor has deliberately tried to dissipate his local assets
                    with the intention of frustrating the creditor’s attempt to enforce any
                    judgment against the debtor. Such an intention is the basis of a finding of an
                    express fraudulent intention on the part of the debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     On the other hand, for cases like <em>Quah Kay Tee</em>, where the creditor’s claim is based
                    on the debtor’s conveyance of property despite of (or causing) its
                    insolvency, there is no need for any finding of express fraudulent intention in
                    order to sustain a claim under s 73B of the CLPA. Instead, the essence of
                    the claim is that the debtor has transferred property to another despite (or
                    thereby causing) its insolvent status, to the detriment of the creditor. This
                    makes it similar to a claim based on unfair preference or transaction at
                    undervalue under ss 98 and 99 of the BA respectively, where the
                    prerequisite is that the debtor must be either insolvent at the time of the
                    transaction, or had became insolvent in consequence of it (s 100(2) of the
                    BA). In our opinion, a s 73B CLPA claim framed in such a manner must be
                    regarded as one that is intimately intertwined with insolvency, since it is
                    entirely contingent on the insolvent status of the debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the present case, it is apparent from
                    Petroprod’s Statement of Claim dated 30 October 2009 that its
                    s 73B CLPA claim against Larsen is based on the insolvency of the four

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in underline in original, emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Accordingly, we held that Petroprod’s
                    s 73B CLPA claim against Larsen was an in fact an insolvency claim that is
                    non-arbitrable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Petroprod’s claims against Larsen do not
                    fall within the scope of the Arbitration Clause (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>–<a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). Even
                    if they do, these claims are non-arbitrable because they are in essence
                    insolvency claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     For these reasons, we dismissed Larsen’s
                    appeal with costs.</p>
