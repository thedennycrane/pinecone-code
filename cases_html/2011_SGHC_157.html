<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arises out of a decision by a
                    district judge on ancillary matters. The appeal covered issues of maintenance
                    and division of matrimonial assets and property. I allowed the appeal on 21
                    April 2011 and now set out my grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant (“the Husband”) is a
                    44-year old Canadian national and manages his own business. The Respondent
                    (“the Wife”) is a 41 year old Chinese national and manages her own
                    art gallery. The parties were married on 20 December 1996 and the Wife
                    obtained an Interim Judgment on 23 January 2009 dissolving the marriage on
                    grounds of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. The parties were
                    therefore married for 12 years and one month. During the marriage, they had two
                    children now aged ten years old and seven years old respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 6 September 2010, a District Judge
                    (“the DJ”) made various orders on the ancillary matters between
                    the parties. The orders provided, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>
<u>Maintenance</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2">With
                        effect from 1 September 2010 and thereafter on the 1st day of every
                        calendar month, the Husband is to contribute monthly maintenance of
                        $4,500.00 made up as to $2,250.00 per month per child.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">
<u>Division of Matrimonial Assets and
                        Property</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2">In full and final settlement of the
                        Wife’s claims to maintenance and a share in the matrimonial assets as
                        well as her claims against the Husband with respect to the costs of her
                        dental treatment, the Husband is to transfer his right title and interest in
                        the matrimonial property to the Wife without any refund to the Husband's
                        Central Provident Fund account of monies utilised there from for the
                        purchase and without any cash consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 15 September 2010, the Husband filed a
                    Notice of Appeal against the orders on maintenance and division of matrimonial
                    assets. On 3 March 2011, Lai Siu Chiu J granted leave to the Husband
                    to admit further evidence for the hearing of this appeal. The further evidence
                    comprised mainly of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Financial statements and bank
                        statements purporting to show the true state of affairs of the
                        Husband’s businesses/alleged businesses and various
                    accounts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Updated
                        Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) search results showing
                        the recent prices of properties similar to the matrimonial property;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Three
                        further affidavits relating to both parties' cars, which stemmed from the
                        Husband’s discovery in November 2010 that the Wife is the owner of a
                        brand-new 2009 BMW 320i.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Husband’s known assets (excluding the matrimonial
                property)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       With respect to the matrimonial assets, the DJ
                    computed the Husband’s contribution as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On appeal, the Husband did not contest the
                    DJ’s assessment of the monies in his CPF account (item 1); the surrender
                    value of insurance policy (item 3) and the SAXO trading account (item 4).
                    Accordingly, the appeal was focussed on the remaining items.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Monies in bank accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Beginning with the Husband’s monies in his
                    bank accounts (item 2), counsel for the Husband mentioned that the DJ omitted to
                    include the Husband’s DBS bank account which, according to his July 2009
                    bank statement, contained $1,272.42. This was accepted by the Wife’s
                        counsel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, I added the $1,272.42 in
                    the Husband’s DBS account into his pool of known assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">[Company 1]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The DJ found (at [28(d)] of her GD) that the
                    Husband had invested some $62,400 (being US$48,000 at an exchange rate of US$1 =
                        S$1.30)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> into [Company 1] and that this
                    should form part of the Husband’s known assets. The DJ’s finding,
                    which can be found in the same paragraph of her GD, was based on the following
                    facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no doubt of the husband's involvement as the documents eg the
                        Purchasing Agreement was addressed to him, the business address is the
                        husband's companies' address, the commercial invoices and person to notify
                        is addressed to the husband (see pages 36 to 41 of P2). In particular, at
                        page 41 of P2, in an exchange of email with a friend, the husband informed
                        his friend that he had invested about $50,000-00 (actual amount
                        US$48,000-00) into the business and his wife was unaware of his
                        involvement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The husband did not deal with this in D3 or D4. He simply did not reply to
                        this issue. There is no explanation from him as to the source of the funds
                        or which account this sum was withdrawn from. There is no corresponding
                        withdrawal of this sum from his disclosed bank accounts for the ancillary
                        matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no disclosure of this business in any of his affidavits
                    notwithstanding his declaration, in his Affidavit of Assets and Means, that he
                    had stated all his assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At this appeal, the Husband’s counsel
                    argued that the further affidavit evidence of one [B] showed that it was [B] who
                    was the major investor in the business, having injected $40,000 into
                        it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Counsel also argued that, in any case,
                    the business obviously did not take off. The income tax assessment for 2008
                    showed that the business incurred losses of $25,498 as at 31 December
                        2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> while the bank
                    statements of the business’ account showed no business activity and that a
                    meagre sum of $31.70 was in the account as at 31 August 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I was not satisfied that [Company 1] belonged
                    to [B]. In the email exchange, which the DJ referred to (at [28(d)] of her GD),
                    the Husband had invited his long-time friend, [C], to invest about US$50,000 in
                    [Company 1]. The Husband had also tellingly informed his friend,
                    “don’t tell your wife or anyone, my wife does not
                        know.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The
                    Husband’s involvement in [Company 1] is also clear from the Purchasing
                    Agreement for US$48,000 which was addressed to him. In my view, [Company 1]
                    belonged to the Husband. I also did not accept that [Company 1] had failed.
                    Accordingly I agreed that the $62,400 invested in [Company 1] should form part
                    of the Husband’s assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Phillip Securities account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The DJ made no finding as to the
                    Husband’s precise holding of shares in his trading account with Phillip
                    Securities as the Husband did not disclose financial details about it to the DJ.
                    This was one of the factors which led the DJ to draw an adverse inference
                    against the Husband (at [29] of her
                    GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[H]e obviously has other financial resources which he has chosen to hide
                        from the court and the wife and in the absence of all other credible
                        explanation this must have been done with the view of defeating the wife's
                        claims to maintenance and to stymie her claims to a division of the
                        matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After the DJ’s decision, the Husband
                    furnished his Phillip Securities account statements for two months which showed
                    that he was holding a portfolio worth $546.19 as at February 2007 and $569.22 as
                    at October 2010 with no trading activity for each of these two
                        months.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     However, even at this late stage, the Husband
                    merely disclosed the account statements for only two months (<em>ie</em>, February 2007 and October 2010) without any evidence about
                    the intervening 44 months. Accordingly, I was of the view that an adverse
                    inference should be drawn since the Husband failed to disclose the full extent
                    of this account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">[Company 2]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The disclosure of [Company 2] stemmed from the
                    Wife who showed an extract from a webpage listing the Husband as the Principal
                        Consultant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.
                    The Husband produced a two-line reply to this stating that [Company 2] was no
                    longer operational and that his name was used to give [C’s] company a
                    “bigger profile”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> This is incidentally the same friend
                    whom the Husband had invited to invest in [Company 1] (see above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>). The DJ drew an adverse inference against
                    the Husband for failing to disclose the full extent of his holding in [Company
                    2].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After the DJ’s decision, the Husband
                    procured written confirmation from [C] that the Husband was neither a director
                    nor shareholder of this company, nor did he receive any compensation or payment
                    from the same. Rather, the Husband had only offered his friend for “no
                    compensation” the right to utilize his company address and phone
                    answering service in Singapore in order to give the impression of a larger reach
                    for the Australian-based company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> I did not accept this explanation which
                    was contrived. As no financial details about this business were given, I was
                    left to draw an adverse inference against the Husband for not fully disclosing
                    this asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">80% shareholding in [Company 3]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Husband did not disclose the value of his
                    80% shareholding in [Company 3]. It is somewhat unclear from the DJ’s GD
                    whether this non-disclosure was one of the factors which led her to draw an
                    adverse inference against the Husband (see GD at [29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Be that as it may, the Husband’s counsel
                    adduced, as further evidence for this appeal, the company’s financial
                    statements from 2007 to 2009 to show that it had made profit after tax in the
                    sum of $4,341 in 2007 before making losses after tax in the sum of $1,429 in
                    2008 and $30,759 in 2009 respectively. The balance sheets show the company as
                    having a net asset value of $66,265 in 2007, $66,836 in 2008 and $36,077 in
                        2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. I accepted that the net asset value should
                    be used and found the Husband's 80% share in the company to be worth $28,861.60
                        (<em>ie</em>, 80% ×
                $36,077).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">80% shareholding in [Company 4]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The DJ used the annual gross income of
                    [Company 4] for 2007 and [Company 5], which is the Wife’s company, for
                    2008 to evaluate their respective worth on the basis that this would be
                    “fair”. While I agree that the same measure should be used for
                    both the Husband’s and the Wife’s companies, the DJ’s choice
                    of gross annual income, as opposed to net asset value, was incorrect. The DJ
                    said (at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> of her GD) that she did not
                    use the net income figures “as this would be incomes [<em>sic</em>] less deductions, some of which had already been disputed by
                    the Wife and some of which were expenses for purposes of tax deductions.”
                    The argument for the Wife was actually that many of the expenses were payments
                    to the Husband for his bonus, fee, remuneration and salary as there was no other
                    staff. However, in my view, while this meant that he had a higher income; it did
                    not mean that the value of [Company 4] should be based on gross income. In so
                    doing, even expenses like the cost of sales were not deducted from the income
                    earned. I agreed with the Husband’s counsel’s argument at para 20 of
                    her submissions that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of particular concern was that the fact that in determining the value of
                        both parties' main companies, namely <em>[Company 4] and
                            [Company 5]</em>, DJ. Koh had chosen firstly, to use the
                            p<em>rofits of the companies' profit</em> &amp;
                        loss statements for a single year instead o<em>f the net
                            assets value based on</em> the balance sheets; and secondly, to
                        use gross profits earned for the year instead of net profits after
                        deductions of expenses incurred. Surely the income earned for a particular
                        year should not <em>be held to be the equivalent
                            of</em> the actual worth of the <em>company</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The net asset value of [Company 4] for 2009
                    was $295,784<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.
                    The Husband’s 80% share amounted to $236,627. However, the net asset value
                    included an “[a]mount due from director” of $180,330 as one of the
                    company’s “[c]urrent asset”. This, the Husband’s
                    counsel suggested at para 25 of her submissions, meant that the actual value of
                    [Company 4] would be $56,297 (being $236,627 less $180,330).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In my view, there was no reason to suggest
                    that the Husband could not pay back the loan, for example, from his future
                    earnings or non-disclosed assets. As such, I retained the value of the
                    Husband’s share in [Company 4] at $236,627.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Car</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Back in March 2009, the Husband owned a
                    second-hand Saab 95 which was purchased for about $62,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>, with an outstanding
                    hire-purchase loan of $45,068 as at March 2009 which incurred a monthly
                    repayment of $1,071.82<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. As
                    the car was involved in two major accidents, the Husband replaced it with
                    another second-hand Saab 95 (of the same make and model) at a purchase price of
                    $61,000 on 17 June 2010. He took up a hire purchase loan for the sum of
                    $52,000 for which he has been making monthly repayments of $884. In the light of
                    these facts, the Husband’s own counsel suggested that the value of the
                    Husband’s car was $9,000 (<em>ie</em>, $61,000 -
                    $52,000). I agreed and added it to the husband’s pool of known
                    assets.</p>

                assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In all, I made the following findings on the
                    Husband’s known assets as set out in <b><u>Schedule
                        A</u></b> of this GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Husband’s non-disclosure of his assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> and <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> in relation to
                    the Phillip Securities account and [Company 2], respectively, I did not believe
                    that the Husband had made full and frank disclosure of his assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Furthermore, it was only after a court order
                    that the Husband furnished his Bankwest account statements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> which showed a zero
                    balance for the months of July 2009, December 2009, January 2010 and September
                    2010. He also furnished his Lloyds TSB account statements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> which showed a
                    negative balance for the months of June 2000, December 2007 and March 2009 as
                    well as a balance of US$115.76 for October 2005 and US$40.76 for February 2007.
                    This was unsatisfactory as only a few bank statements for random months were
                    haphazardly exhibited. As such I did not believe Husband’s counsel’s
                    statement at para 37 of her submissions that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]hese bank statements show that both were inactive and 'empty' accounts.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Accordingly, I drew an adverse inference
                    against the Husband in that I concluded that he had failed to fully disclose his

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As both parties did not contest the DJ’s
                    finding on the monies in the Wife’s CPF account (item 1), there was no
                    need for me to re-examine it. Accordingly, I will address the remaining items in
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Monies in bank accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I accepted the submission by both counsel that
                    there was an error in the DJ’s GD and that the Wife’s monies in her
                    bank account should read as $43,428.97 and not $33,428.97.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Surrender value of insurance policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I also found that the DJ erred in including
                    the surrender value of the children’s insurance policies as part of the
                    Wife’s known assets. As the Wife’s counsel noted at para 75 of
                    her submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]hese policies were clearly purchased for the purpose of providing funds
                        for the children’s tertiary education as the policies were due to

                        been no suggestion whatsoever that the Plaintiff [Wife] would liquidate
                        these policies or use them for any purpose other than what it was intended
                        for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">[Company 5]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In keeping with my finding on [Company 4] (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>), the DJ erred in using the
                    annual gross income instead of the net asset value to determine the value of
                    [Company 5]. Accordingly, [Company 5’s] value should properly be $144,950
                    (being the net asset value for 2008).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Car</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Husband’s counsel argued that the
                    Wife’s deliberate failure to disclose her recent purchase of a new BMW
                    320i together with her earlier request for the Husband to pay her a sum of
                    $15,000 for the purpose of purchasing a “small (1.5 litre) car for my
                    [the Wife’s] use and for the use of the children”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> showed that she has other
                    sources of funds which were not disclosed before the DJ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> I was thus invited to draw an adverse
                    inference against the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On closer inspection, I was not persuaded by
                    this argument. The BMW 320i was purchased on 29 March 2009 for $131,800 at
                    a time when, according to the Wife, the COE price of $5,000 was quite low. The
                    balance purchase price of $21,800 from the Wife’s previous car was
                    indirectly discounted off the purchase price of the BMW 320i, meaning that the
                    Wife effectively paid $110,000 for the car. From this amount, the Wife said that
                    she paid the deposit of $10,000 from her credit card and obtained a loan for
                    $100,000, repayable by monthly instalments of $1,424 for seven years. I accepted
                    the Wife’s explanations. I also accepted the Wife’s affidavit
                    evidence that her sister would help to pay for the car. Thus I was not minded to
                    find that the Wife had failed to provide full and frank disclosure of her assets
                    and/or income. However, the fact that she purchased a new BMW 320i suggested
                    that her financial situation was not as poor as she might have otherwise wanted
                    me to believe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At this juncture it should be noted that the
                    Husband did not argue that the Wife had failed to disclose any other assets, for
                    example, in China. Accordingly, I did not draw any adverse inference against the
                    Wife on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Court’s assessment of the Wife’s known assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In all, I made the following findings on the
                    Wife’s known assets as stated in <b><u>Schedule
                        B</u></b> of this GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The matrimonial property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The sole matrimonial property is a
                    three-bedroom condominium bought by the parties in their joint
                names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In her GD, the DJ noted (at [50]) that at the time of the hearing, both
                    parties agreed that the net value of the matrimonial property was about
                    $390,000. This was derived by subtracting the outstanding mortgage of
                    $596,005.63 from the market value of the property at $980,000 as at August
                        2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Both parties in their written
                        submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and
                    at the hearing before me <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> agreed that
                    the Wife should get 45% of the net value of the matrimonial property. As such
                    the only dispute concerned the net value of the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On appeal the Husband’s counsel argued
                    that the DJ had used outdated data from the URA on transaction prices in August
                    2008. Instead, the DJ should have used updated transaction prices as at August
                    2010, being around the time of the DJ’s order on 6 September 2010. This,
                    counsel argued, meant that the market value of the matrimonial property should
                    have been around $1,335,500.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Indeed, real estate prices in general and the
                    prices of condominiums, like the one in the present case in particular, have
                    risen considerably in the last two years and the DJ should have adopted the
                    current market value as at the date of the hearing. Taking into account the
                    Wife’s concern<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> that the figure of $1,335,500 was not
                    an accurate guide because there were two other flats (of a similar size) which
                    were sold for $1,116,000 and $1,250,000 in August 2010 and July 2010
                        respectively<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>, I
                    took the average of the three prices. This came up to approximately $1,230,000.
                    As the outstanding loan for the property as at 31 August 2010 was
                        $546,000,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> I found the net value of the property to
                    be $684,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     By a letter dated 5 May 2011, the
                    Wife’s solicitors made a request to present further arguments. I acceded
                    to the request and the hearing thereof was on 27 May 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Wife’s counsel submitted that a
                    transacted price of $1,335,000 (which I had taken into account as stated in
                        <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above) was the highest recorded
                    price for a unit of a size similar to that of the matrimonial property and that
                    was never reached again even in transactions after August 2010 until 2011.
                    She said that the unit which attracted the price of $1,335,000 was on the ninth
                    floor and was facing a pool whereas the matrimonial home was on the fifth floor
                    and was not facing the pool.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On the other hand, the Husband’s counsel
                    submitted that the transacted prices after August 2010 showed that the
                    average price of units of a similar size was still higher than the $1,230,000
                    value I had come to. In other words, the value I had ascribed to the matrimonial
                    home was still valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Wife’s counsel also argued that I
                    should take the average of prices for a longer period before September 2010
                    (which was the month in which the DJ made her decision). The counsel suggested
                    using prices between the date of the interim judgment (<em>ie</em>, 23 January 2009) to the date of the hearing of the
                    ancillaries by the DJ (<em>ie</em>, 25 August 2010)
                    or, alternatively, a 12-month period before the date of the hearing by the DJ,
                        (<em>ie</em>, August 2009 to
                July 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It was obvious to me that the Wife was simply
                    trying to deflate the value of the matrimonial property by the suggestions
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above. There was no reason
                    to use such a long period to ascertain the value of the matrimonial property.
                    The value should be determined as close as possible to the date of the hearing
                    before the DJ or her decision because the Wife would have the full benefit of
                    the matrimonial property once the Husband transferred his interest to her. An
                    alternative would be to use the value as at the date of the hearing of the
                    appeal before me but, as the Husband’s counsel submitted, there was no
                    material difference in favour of the Wife if I were to use a date nearer to the
                    date of the hearing before me. Since the value was still valid, the submission
                    in [41] did not carry much weight. I
                    maintained my decision on the value of the matrimonial property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of the matrimonial assets (including the matrimonial
                property)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On this basis the Wife would have to pay the
                    Husband $376,200 to purchase his 55% share of the matrimonial property. However,
                    this would be set-off against 35% of the Husband’s known assets which I
                    awarded to the Wife (<em>ie</em>, 35% ×
                    $456,287.59 = $159,701) for her substantial indirect contribution as the primary
                    caregiver to the children despite running [Company 5] and the Husband’s
                    failure to disclose all his assets. There would also be a further set-off from
                    the Wife’s lump sum maintenance of $39,000 (see below at <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>) and a net sum of $7,700 for costs which the
                    Husband was owing to the Wife (see below at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>). On the other hand, the Wife would also have to repay the
                    Husband for the sums he had paid in repayment of the mortgage loan from
                    September 2010 to the time he stops payment<em>, ie</em>,
                    up to and including April 2011 (<em>ie</em>, $2,800
                        × 8 months = $22,400).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the end, this will result in the Wife
                    having to pay the Husband $192,199, as set out in <b><u>Schedule
                        C</u></b> to this GD. From this amount, the Husband is to reimburse his
                    CPF account for amounts used to pay for the matrimonial property and/or housing
                    loan and interest thereon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Although the Wife did not have to pay anything
                    for the transfer of the property under the DJ’s order, my order can be
                    explained on the basis of the higher net value of the matrimonial property
                        (<em>ie</em>, $684,000 instead of $390,000) and the
                    Wife’s revised share of the Husband’s reduced assets (<em>ie</em>, $159,701 instead of $199,358.17).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     At the hearing on 21 April 2011, the
                    Husband’s counsel informed the Court that he was prepared to accept the
                    lump sum maintenance for the Wife ordered by the DJ at $39,000 (not $39,400
                    which is a typographical error). As this was no longer in dispute, I ordered
                    that the $39,000 owing to the Wife be off-set against the amount which the Wife
                    would have to pay to purchase the Husband’s share of the matrimonial
                    property (see above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the two children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The DJ found the two children’s personal
                    monthly expenses to be $1,435.90 and $1,154.50 respectively. On top of that, the
                    DJ awarded $3,291.30 for their share of household expenses. Their overall
                    expenses amounted to $5,881.70. Accordingly, the Husband was ordered to pay 75%
                    of the overall expenses which amounted to $4,500 per month (rounded up from
                    $4,411.28 per month) (see DJ’s GD at [33]-[35]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On appeal the Husband did not contest the
                    proportion of the maintenance which he was ordered to pay. He also accepted most
                    of the expenses which the DJ attributed to the children except for those stated
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The DJ had taken into account a monthly
                    mortgage payment which the Wife was paying in respect of the matrimonial
                    property as part of the children’s expenses. The Wife was paying a net
                    cash sum of $2,800 (after using $500 from her CPF account). After dividing the
                    $2,800 between the Wife and the two children, the share of both the children was
                    $1,866.66. The DJ took this sum as part of the children’s
                expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Husband’s counsel submitted that
                    this sum ought not to have been taken into account as it was used to acquire an
                    asset for the Wife. I agreed. The children’s household expenses were
                    therefore reduced by $1,866.66.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Secondly, the Husband objected to the quantum
                    for one item of the elder child’s personal expenses. This was the tuition
                    expense for English/Mathematics. Based on the receipts exhibited by the Wife for
                    this item, I reduced the sum awarded for this item from $450 per month to $210
                    per month. This was a reduction of $240 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Thirdly, the Husband objected to any expense
                    for English/Mathematics tuition for the younger child as he was not aware of
                    such tuition for that child and there were no receipts to evidence the same. I
                    accepted his objection. This meant a reduction of $450 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The DJ had ascertained the overall expenses of
                    the children (both household and personal) to be $5,881.70. After deducting the
                    three sums mentioned above (at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>), their expenses amounted to a
                    rounded figure of $3,325 per month. The Husband’s 75% share was a rounded
                    figure of $2,500 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the hearing for further arguments, the Wife
                    sought to adduce additional evidence about the tuition for the younger child and
                    new expenses incurred after the hearing before the DJ without an affidavit and
                    without leave to adduce such evidence. I declined to admit such evidence without
                    prejudice to any application for variation which she may wish to
                make.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     At the said hearing, the Wife also wanted the
                    children’s maintenance to be backdated to the date the Husband left the
                    family, <em>ie</em>, March 2008. However, there was no
                    appeal by the Wife in respect of the children’s maintenance or at all.
                    Accordingly, my hands were tied and I could not allow such
                back-dating.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Set-off of costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     At the hearing for further arguments, the Wife
                    wanted to set-off $8,300 legal costs which the Husband owed the Wife against the
                    sum she had to pay him for the transfer of his interest in the matrimonial home.
                    The Husband was agreeable to that. As I was ordering the Wife to pay costs of
                    $600 to the Husband for the hearing of further arguments, the net costs owing by
                    the Husband to the Wife was $7,700. I allowed her to set-off this sum as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     To recapitulate, I held:</p>
