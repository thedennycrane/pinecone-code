Instead of taking advantage of his lead, which was about 50m, he decided to wait for his rivals.

</div> This answer resulted in various applications and also formed a primary focus of the recusal application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Recusal application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Mr Soh made various categories of contentions that I deal with in their broader context of judicial interference and apparent bias.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Judicial interference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In determining whether there has been excessive judicial interference, the ultimate question for the court is whether or not there has been the possibility of denial of justice to a particular party: <span class="font-italic">BOI</span><span class="font-italic"> v BOJ </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">BOI</span>”) at [111]. The doctrine does not exclude against all and any interference. Rather, it aims to prevent <span class="font-italic">excessive</span> judicial interference. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Nabil bin Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Fuad v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 1 SLR 984 at [166]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thus, for excessive judicial interference to be established, it would generally be necessary to show that the situation was “an <span class="font-italic">egregious</span> one” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali</span> at [175(g)]). Plainly, where a complaint of excessive judicial interference is made on appeal, the appellate court will consider whether the court below has in fact acted in a manner that has resulted in <span class="font-italic">actual prejudice</span> to the relevant party; the relevant inquiry is not whether a fair-minded person would <span class="font-italic">reasonably</span> <span class="font-italic">suspect</span> or <span class="font-italic">apprehend</span> that the court below was biased (see BOI at [112]). Actual prejudice could, for instance, arise if a judge intervenes in the proceedings to such an extent that it prevents a party from presenting its case. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The question of whether interference is excessive is both a quantitative and qualitative one: <span class="font-italic">BOI </span>at [135]. Qualitative factors are concerned with the purpose of the interference, whether such interference is focused, the effect of the interference and the tone and demeanour of the judge. Quantitative factors are concerned with the frequency and length of interventions. The two main mischiefs that the doctrine aims to curtail are: first, where the judge, in interfering, has not observed her proper role; and second, where a party has been prevented from presenting his case by the interference. Both mischiefs were contended by defence counsel in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Defence counsel’s contentions centred on three issues: The first and main issue, was about the DJ’s interruptions during his cross-examination on what he termed the “700m issue”.

Arising from the DJ’s interruptions, he said, he was prevented from making his point and putting his case to the witness. However, from the transcript, defence counsel was able to elicit the points required from Mr Liew to make his case. He established that Mr Liew’s Act of Fair Play ended at the 700-metre mark after the U-turn, after a time of about two and a half minutes, at which point Mr Soh and the “chase pack” caught up with him.

</div> An examination of the transcript did not show that the DJ took on any improper role, nor was there any improper purpose actuating the DJ’s suggestion. Mr Liew had mentioned two landmarks during the repeated cross-examination on the 700m estimate, and the DJ saw this as an opportunity to use Google Maps to come to a more accurate and objective understanding. It was also important to note that in the course of this exercise, the DJ had also noted that there were <span class="font-italic">two clearings</span>.

First, when parties were discussing why the four statutory declarations were not tendered as evidence, counsel for the plaintiff explained that they were disclosed and the defendant’s discovery obligations were accordingly discharged, and defence counsel disputed this point. The DJ found that the plaintiff did give disclosure pursuant to a notice to produce, and the plaintiff did not see the declarations as necessary as supporting evidence for his case.

In <span class="font-italic">Kathleen Chua</span>, a district judge had foreclosed several lines of cross-examination by the prosecution, which related to the accused’s motivation and relationship with the victim and were clearly relevant: see [28]–[29]. The witness there had only been on the stand for two hours. The district judge in that case had also made several rude comments to the prosecution when cutting off their line of questioning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The analogy drawn with <span class="font-italic">Kathleen Chua</span> was not tenable. In my judgment, the transcripts show that defence counsel had a full and extensive time of cross-examination. Mr Liew was cross-examined over a period of five days. Excluding the time taken for interposing foreign witnesses, interruptions and oral submissions arising therefrom, and interlocutory applications, defence counsel had a total of over 11 hours, as follows: on the first day, more than two hours; on the second day, about three hours; on the third day, about four hours; on the fifth day, about one-and-a-half hours; and on the sixth day, some fifty minutes. By way of comparison, plaintiff counsel’s cross-examination of Mr Soh over two days totalled about five-and-a-half hours with about four-and-a-half hours on 11 September 2020 and about an hour on 24 September 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 A sense of perspective would be useful. In the round, this issue of the distance of 700m from the U-turn is only an aspect of the broader question, did Mr Liew slow down at the U-turn? Mr Liew’s ability to explain himself is only one factor to consider in the context of all the evidence adduced.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Apparent bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The remaining arguments concern apparent bias. The law on apparent bias was definitively restated in the case of <span class="font-italic">BOI</span> at [103]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">The general test is an objective one</span>: whether there are circumstances that would give rise to a <span class="font-italic">reasonable suspicion or apprehension</span> of bias in the fair-minded and informed observer.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">“Reasonable suspicion or apprehension”</span>:<span class="font-italic"> </span>there is a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias when an observer would think, from relevant circumstances, that bias is possible. This belief cannot be fanciful, and it must be a reasoned one, capable of articulation with reference to the evidence presented.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">The observer’s perspective</span> <span class="font-italic">is that from which matters are to be judged</span>: the court must not supplant the observer’s perspective by assuming knowledge outside the scope of knowledge of a reasonably well-informed member of the public. Detailed knowledge of the law and court procedure, or insider information regarding the character and ability of the members of the court or tribunal, would not be attributed to the observer. Instead, the observer would be informed of all relevant facts that are generally capable of being known by members of the public, including the traditions of integrity and impartiality that the administrators of justice have to uphold. The observer must also be fair-minded, and cannot be unduly complacent, sensitive or suspicious. For example, they should not jump to hasty conclusions of bias based on isolated episodes of temper or remarks taken out of context. The court may only consider circumstances which were available to an observer witnessing proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The contentions of apparent bias were broadly in two categories. First, that a series of errors he contended the DJ made showed her inclination to rule against Mr Soh. Second, that she made various remarks which he contended prejudged Mr Soh’s case or showed an underlying bias against Mr Soh.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Series of errors alleged as evidence of bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It was conceded at the hearing that there is a distinction between judicial error and apparent bias. As noted in <span class="font-italic">TOW v TOV </span>[2017] 3 SLR 725 at [46], “[a]n error in law or fact does not mean that bias was present or an appearance of bias created”. Defence counsel argued instead that a series of errors in this case gave rise to the perception of bias. The main plank of defence arguments related to RAS 24 and RAS 25. I deal with the substance of these appeals first and come to her comments made in the context of these applications separately at [34]–[41].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 RAS 25 concerned the dismissal of an application for an expert witness filed on the fourth day of trial. The defence contention was that the application for an expert witness was filed because of the issue as to whether Mr Liew slowed down. It was related to an earlier appeal I dealt with on 21 October 2020, Registrar’s Appeal from the State Courts No 17 of 2020 (“RAS 17”), which was a failed attempt to adduce additional GPS records from Mr Soh’s GPS watch in the midst of trial. Pertinent to this was that Mr Soh, from the outset, estimated that he took seven minutes to catch up with Mr Liew. If the GPS records were relevant, they would have been relevant to Mr Soh’s assertions from the outset, and Mr Soh had breached his discovery obligations in not disclosing these GPS records from his watch earlier. Similar to RAS 17, if Mr Soh had thought fit to use an expert earlier to discuss the pace of the runners in the context of the time needed for the “chase pack” to catch up, he ought to have done so much earlier, and not midway through trial. More fundamentally, a coach’s evidence as to how elite marathon runners usually run would not be relevant; neither would his testimony be necessary in the context of Mr Liew’s or Mr Soh’s personal best times, which his draft affidavit also dealt with. Mr Liew, Mr Soh, and Mr Takizaki could have been cross-examined on (a) how elite marathon runners usually run, (b) how they themselves usually run, or (c) their personal best times. The salient issue was how Mr Liew ran on the day in question, and whether he slowed down. That is a factual query for the court, not an expert. RAS 25 was therefore dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 RAS 24 concerned Mr Liew’s application to amend his SOC filed on the in the evening of 23 September 2020, just before the scheduled final day of trial, 24 September 2020. This was granted by the DJ on 24 September 2020 with no order on costs. These amendments concerned particulars of aggravated and exemplary damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Registrar’s Appeal from the State Courts No 18 of 2020 (“RAS 18”) forms part of the background to this issue. RAS 18 was in respect of Mr Liew’s adduction of a Supplementary Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“SAEIC”). This was allowed by the DJ on the second day of trial. The SAEIC comprised social media posts made by Mr Soh and other documents whose authenticity were not disputed by Mr Soh. There was no prejudice occasioned by this as the SAEIC made no assertions and Mr Soh was aware of and did not dispute the authenticity of the documents; their relevance would depend upon matters already pleaded or alluded to. RAS 18 was dismissed at the same time as RAS 17.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 RAS 24, on the other hand, was a different matter. The amendments to the SOC sought to add particulars to the pleading for aggravated and exemplary damages. The premise for the amendment was that it would not occasion prejudice, on the footing that the particulars were of documents already admitted into court, either through the Agreed Bundle or Mr Liew’s SAEIC.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The argument that there was no prejudice was tenuous: the plaintiff has closed his case, and the cross-examination of the defendant has been completed. The defendant would be entitled to reply, put in any evidence in his own defence, and to cross-examine the plaintiff accordingly. More fundamentally, the 157 pages of particulars were prolix and contained many aspects of evidence. The pleading as it stood embarrassed the defendant in his defence of the suit. On 1 March 2021, and because matters remained unsatisfactory, again on 2 March 2021, I allowed counsel for the plaintiff time to consider the issues and to submit thereafter with the benefit of pleading precedents. Even so, the plaintiff’s latest proposal of 16 March 2021 remained prolix, with multiple assertions of evidence over 39 pages. In contrast, the precedents he exhibited by way of submission were entirely limited to allegations of material fact, as pleadings should be. In the form submitted, the draft amendments remained prolix and would embarrass a fair trial. Defence counsel characterised the application as a back-door attempt by the plaintiff to rectify his SAEIC, on the hypothesis that the plaintiff’s application arose after his counsel was not allowed to cross-examine Mr Soh on the contents of the documents annexed to the SAEIC on the seventh day of trial.

</div> The earlier SAEIC, filed on 9 September 2020 after leave was given on 2 September 2020, contained no evidence in chief regarding the documents annexed. Pleadings, however, cannot replace the function of evidence in chief. In the event that there is an absence of evidence on a material fact pleaded, that would in any event be fatal to that particular aspect of the case. I allowed the appeal and set aside the orders made below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The ruling on the application to amend the pleadings was therefore an error. Another error defence counsel relied on was in respect of the DJ’s order made at trial to disallow any publication of the name of an individual who had made a statutory declaration for the SNOC, Ms Jenny Huang.

On the other hand, when the application was filed, the expert’s draft affidavit would have finally made the point clear, because the new evidence was not to show the boundaries of human possibility. Thus, in relation to what was being sought to be adduced, the merits of the application, would also be plain: see [28] above. In Mr Liew’s case, the questions as to his best time, his time after the U-turn and whether he slowed down, had been put and answered on the afternoon of the first day, <span class="font-italic">before</span> Mr Liew’s counsel objected, and <span class="font-italic">before </span>Mr Soh’s counsel explained the issue as one of a “scientific” perspective: see [12] above.

</div> From an examination of the transcripts, these were by way of preliminary remarks, and it would not have appeared to the reasonable observer that the DJ had come to a final and conclusive decision: see, in this context, <span class="font-italic">BOI</span> at [101].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on apparent bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 There were other contentions that I do not think useful to deal with<span class="font-italic"> seriatim</span>.

These were matters relevant to appeal and not recusal, and I did not examine them save where relevant to RAS 24 and RAS 25. The remaining category concerned various ad-hoc requests that the DJ did not accede to on various matters relating to case management such as timelines and adjournments. These refusals could not, in and of themselves, be perceived as bias and I do not see the need to detail each one in these grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 A finding of apparent bias is one made in the context of the entirety of proceedings.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> A perusal of the certified transcript did not, in my opinion, reflect his interpretation of it. Counsel are reminded that wherever a judge is quoted, proper etiquette suggests that a transcript should be requested of the judge. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Hodgson v Imperial Tobacco Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1998] 1 WLR 1056, quoted by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Min v </span><span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland plc </span>[2013] 4 SLR 529 at [11], where the English Court of Appeal made the point that chambers hearings are not confidential or secret, it stated that information about what occurs in chambers should “be made available to the public <span class="font-italic">when requested</span>” [emphasis added]. This is particularly important in recusal applications, where there is a danger of confirmation bias on the part of counsel who may already be under a mistaken impression. In <span class="font-italic">BOI</span>, the Court of Appeal noted how the unofficial transcripts in that case were tainted by the bias of the parties against the particular judge: at [118]–[119].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 A final and related matter is that the examination of the transcripts necessitated by this application, illuminated the vital importance of court rules and court etiquette in ensuring effective access to justice. This was a simple defamation case that was essentially factual; it could well have finished within the 8 days that it was set down for with good order. First, the multiple interlocutory applications that whittled down trial time were filed just before and during trial. These could have been considered, filed and argued much earlier. During trial, cross-examination was marked by not infrequent, and sometimes lengthy, objections by counsel; unnecessary remarks to each other and to witnesses may well have distracted from the issues at hand. Counsel have a duty to their clients to pursue their interests diligently and to prepare their cases well: see r 5(1) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules<span class="font-italic"> </span>2015 (S 706/2015) (the “PCR”). Concomitant with this, is the duty to treat fellow members of the bar with proper decorum. Rules 4(f), 7(1)(a) and (b) of the PCR stipulate that counsel have a duty to accord one another with respect, dignity and courtesy. Good order in litigation is fundamental to a fair and effective trial process, without which the merits of any case could easily be obscured. Rules 4(a), 9(1)(a) and (e) of the PCR also make clear that counsel have a duty to the court to assist in the administration of justice and to conduct their case in a manner which maintains the fairness, integrity and efficiency of proceedings. Sundaresh Menon CJ recently emphasised in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Parti Liyani </span>[2020] 5 SLR 1080 at [35] that counsel’s <span class="font-italic">paramount</span> duty is to assist the court in the administration of justice. I mention, as an illustration of how these three sets of duties coalesce, a letter sent by counsel two days after I disposed of matters. This was a request for an extension of time for leave to appeal by way of letter and referenced an unanswered request to opposing counsel to agree. Due consideration for client, fellow counsel and court would suggest that prior to drafting such a letter, counsel ought to have studied ss 29, 29A and 29B of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) and Rule 56A of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (he was referred to these provisions by way of response).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 RAS 35 and RAS 25 were dismissed. RAS 24 was allowed and the orders made in the application below were set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In respect of costs, the three appeals filed by Mr Soh were related. RAS 35 was the most substantive. It required extensive examination of the transcripts and of the various interlocutory applications and appeals, including RAS 24 and RAS 25. It was more appropriate to make a single order, and in that context I took into consideration that for RAS 24, Mr Soh would also have been entitled to the costs below. I awarded Mr Liew half of the costs of RAS 35. These costs were fixed in the round, inclusive of disbursements, at $10,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Allegations of excessive judicial interference and judicial bias, while necessary when appropriate, are extremely serious and should only be employed with great circumspection and care. Inevitably, they occasion costs to clients, public resources and the justice system as a whole. The Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">BOI</span> at [141] remains apt:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, we cannot emphasise enough how extremely serious allegations of judicial bias are. Indeed, such allegations can be utilised not only as a weapon of abuse by disgruntled litigants but also waste valuable court time and resources in the process. We would imagine that, by their very nature, such allegations would be rare in the extreme. Should such proceedings arise before the court in the future and be found to be unmeritorious, there may be serious consequences.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Clarence Lun Yaodong, Samuel Lim Jie Bin, Phee Wei Qi, Shanice and Selina Shantini Naidu (Fervent Chambers LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Teng Hin Weng, Mark and Lim Tianjun (That.Legal LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
