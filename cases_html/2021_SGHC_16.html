But Salzawiyah still faces a charge for the offence of trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA and s 34 of the Penal Code, except that the analysed weight of diamorphine reflected in her charge was amended to “not less than 14.99g” rather than “not less than 42.27g”.

The Prosecution has accepted Jumadi’s assertion in his statements that some packets found in the Unit were meant for his consumption. However, in the computation of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking in the original charges against the accused persons, the Prosecution had erroneously included three packets of diamorphine seized from the Unit marked B1B, B1C1 and B1D1 which Jumadi said were for his own consumption. Accordingly, the Prosecution amended the charges against the accused persons. The charges against Shisham and Jumadi were amended to reflect a lower gross weight and analysed weight of the diamorphine.

At this time, Salzawiyah became afraid that she would be arrested for consumption and possession of drugs. Nevertheless, she did not attempt to leave the vicinity because she felt that it would be tantamount to betraying Jumadi. Instead, she called Shisham to alert Jumadi and Shisham.

</div> Shisham’s case is based largely on his statements to the CNB, which he did not object to being admitted as evidence in this trial, as he acknowledged that these statements were given by him voluntarily. According to those statements, Shisham’s defence is that he only went to the Unit to consume drugs. He had no involvement in the drug trafficking operation except that he had given Jumadi the telephone number of an Indian Malaysian drug supplier known as “Black”. Any orders for drugs placed by Jumadi were made directly with the drug supplier, without Shisham’s involvement. Although he went out with Jumadi on two occasions to collect drugs, he had no knowledge of any of the Drugs and drug paraphernalia recovered from the Unit, or any drug trafficking activities that were taking place. Neither did he share a common intention with Jumadi and Salzawiyah to traffic in the Drugs.

As for all the calls to and from Vishu, Jumadi had been the one who conversed with Vishu using his mobile phone, without putting the mobile phone on loudspeaker mode. Thus, Shisham was not aware of what Jumadi had discussed with Vishu. Further, although Shisham admits to accompanying Jumadi to Changi South Lane, he left the Car and went to a nearby canteen to purchase some drinks. When he returned to the Car, Jumadi drove back to the Unit.

SSSgt Fardlie, IO Yip, Mr Faiz and SSSgt Hamidah were clear and consistent in their accounts of what transpired during the recording of the relevant Statements and that the Promise had not in fact been made. Similarly, Dr Yeo was clear that Jumadi had not mentioned the Promise that was allegedly given to him by SSSgt Fardlie. Dr Yeo said that Jumadi was hopeful of obtaining leniency by his cooperation. I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that there was no reason for any of these witnesses to lie.

</div> This was especially the case for Mr Faiz and Dr Yeo. They were not directly involved in the investigations of the drug trafficking charge against Jumadi. Mr Faiz was an interpreter during the recording of Jumadi’s statements while Dr Yeo assessed Jumadi’s mental state. I, therefore, found their evidence to be credible and accepted their evidence. Their evidence was also supported by the contemporaneous documents such as Dr Yeo’s clinical notes, the field diary and the MDP Notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In contrast, Jumadi was the only witness who testified in support of his case. As such, Jumadi’s claim of involuntariness rested solely upon his own uncorroborated testimony of what had transpired during the statement-recording process. However, in contrast to the Prosecution’s evidence, Jumadi’s evidence was inconsistent with what was actually recorded in the statements. It was also inconsistent with the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses and the contemporaneous evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Before I delve further into the issues, I would like to make an observation that the Prosecution in its submissions attempted to discredit Jumadi’s case and asserted that Jumadi’s counsel failed to put material parts of his case to the other arresting officers who testified at the main trial.

</div> However, SSSgt Fardlie and SSgt Phang Yee Leong James (“SSgt Phang”) were the only two arresting officers who testified at the ancillary hearing. The evidence of the other arresting officers was given <span class="font-italic">at the main trial</span>, whereas the issue of voluntariness was to be determined <span class="font-italic">at the ancillary hearing</span>. Therefore, it was unreasonable to expect Jumadi’s counsel to raise the ancillary issue of voluntariness at the main trial.

In addition to my general observations above, I shall now furnish other reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Firstly, SSSgt Fardlie’s explanation for the cancellation was eminently reasonable.

</div> He admitted that he made a mistake when writing down the time and he corrected it. There was no need for Jumadi to countersign against the cancellation as it pertained to <span class="font-italic">timing</span>, rather than the <span class="font-italic">contents</span> of the statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Secondly, the court is entitled to examine the contents of an impugned statement in its determination of whether it should be excluded or not (see <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] SGCA 116 at [85]). Jumadi’s claim that the First Contemporaneous Statement had been recorded <span class="font-italic">after </span>SSSgt Fardlie searched the Unit was inconsistent with the very first question posed by SSSgt Fardlie in the First Contemporaneous Statement. SSSgt Fardlie had asked, “<span class="font-italic">Before</span> I search this place, do you have anything to surrender?” [emphasis added].
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-80ded0aa-b544-474e-9ad0-77ea58098238" data-toggle="modal" type="button">161</button></sup>

</div> This directly contradicted and demolished Jumadi’s claim about the Promise.

</div> In my view, this was a crucial point which significantly undermined Jumadi’s case. According to Jumadi, the Promise was first given by SSSgt Fardlie in order to get Jumadi to admit to ownership of the items that had been found in the Unit. This is premised on the fact that the search <span class="font-italic">had already taken place</span>. However, it is clear that the First Contemporaneous Statement was recorded <span class="font-italic">before</span> the search was conducted. At this time, the items had not yet been seized and there was nothing that SSSgt Fardlie could have asked Jumadi to admit to owning. Therefore, my finding that the First Contemporaneous Statement was recorded prior to the search of the Unit significantly undermined the fundamental foundation of the Promise.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Thirdly, SSgt Phang’s evidence supported SSSgt Fardlie’s evidence that the First Contemporaneous Statement had been recorded at 2.25pm, rather than at 2.55pm, as was put to SSSgt Fardlie during cross-examination by Jumadi’s counsel.

</div>  With respect, I do not agree with the submission of Jumadi’s counsel. In the First Contemporaneous Statement, Jumadi said that “everything here in this house are [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] mine” which he said was “about 6 stones” meaning six bundles of diamorphine.

SSSgt Fardlie’s evidence that the MDP Notice had been administered before the recording of the Second Contemporaneous Statement was supported by the timings written in the field diary and the MDP Notice.

</div> Although Shisham and Salzawiyah might not have been privy to the alleged conversation between Jumadi and SSSgt Fardlie in which SSSgt Fardlie made the Promise, they could have corroborated the earlier portion of Jumadi’s account regarding the search and SSSgt Fardlie’s actions before the recording of the First Contemporaneous Statement. This would have gone some way towards supporting Jumadi’s evidence. Similarly, Jumadi claimed that he had told Shisham and Dr Yeo about the Promise but he did not call them as his witnesses.

Shisham and Salzawiyah were present in court throughout the entire ancillary hearing and could have readily given evidence in support of Jumadi’s case. Dr Yeo was in the Prosecution’s list of witnesses for the main trial and could have been contacted to give evidence. In fact, Dr Yeo was eventually called by the Prosecution as a rebuttal witness at the ancillary hearing after Jumadi’s allegations about telling Dr Yeo about the Promise given by SSSgt Fardlie were revealed for the first time in court. This was admitted by Jumadi’s counsel who did not object to the Prosecution calling Dr Yeo as a rebuttal witness. In these circumstances, Jumadi’s allegations about the Promise made by SSSgt Fardlie appeared highly questionable. By not calling Salzawiyah, Shisham and Dr Yeo, it seemed that Jumadi knew that they would not be able to corroborate his testimony. Indeed, this was what happened when the Prosecution called Dr Yeo to the stand and Dr Yeo gave evidence refuting Jumadi’s claims. When Salzawiyah subsequently gave evidence in the main trial, she refuted Jumadi’s account of what had occurred in the living room of the Unit before Jumadi’s First Contemporaneous Statement was recorded.

</div> This fortified my earlier decision at the ancillary hearing.

I also found that the First Contemporaneous Statement had been recorded before SSSgt Fardlie commenced his search of the Unit, and the MDP Notice had been administered to Jumadi by SSSgt Fardlie before he recorded the Second Contemporaneous Statement. The contemporaneous evidence supports the Prosecution’s case. Furthermore, in light of the abovementioned inconsistencies, Jumadi’s lack of credibility and my doubts regarding the veracity of his evidence, I concluded that Jumadi had not raised a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case that the Promise had not been made to Jumadi. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) The MDP Notice</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 It was not disputed that the MDP Notice was administered to Jumadi.

In that case, the accused had been charged with the importation of a controlled drug pursuant to s 7 of the MDA. A notification regarding s 33B of the MDA was read to and signed by the accused, which the court referred to as the “MDA Notification”. The MDA Notification was similar to the MDP Notice in this case save that the wording of the MDA Notification was slightly different, and the MDA Notification did not contain the penultimate paragraph of the MDP Notice cited at [100] above. Lee Seiu Kin J observed at [12]–[13] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 There is no doubt that the MDA notification falls within Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) to s 258(3) of the CPC as the provisions of s 33B of the MDA are reproduced in it. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 … Indeed, the MDA Notification is an inducement or promise, in that it holds out a possibility to an accused person that if he, being a mere courier, provides useful information to the CNB, he would escape the death penalty and be sentenced instead to life imprisonment with caning. To the extent that the MDA Notification is an inducement or promise, Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) to s 258(3) of the CPC has taken it outside the scope of that subsection so that statements recorded subsequent to the MDA Notification are not inadmissible on this ground alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The same reasoning applies to this case. Here, the MDP Notice sets out the circumstances under which life imprisonment may be imposed by the court in lieu of the death penalty. I note that Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>) refers to the accused being informed “in writing”, whereas the MDP Notice here was printed out, read to Jumadi and signed by him. In my view, this did not bring the administration of the MDP Notice out of the ambit of Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>). The fact that the MDP Notice was read to and signed by Jumadi did not make it any more a threat, inducement or promise than if the MDP Notice had simply been given to him. No legitimate distinction can be made between these two situations. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Sibeko</span>, the MDA Notification had also been read to and signed by the accused person. Yet, the court did not raise this as a reason to bring the MDA Notification out of the ambit of Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 One distinction between the MDP Notice and the MDA Notification in <span class="font-italic">Sibeko </span>is that the MDP Notice here contains an additional paragraph, beginning with the line stating “You are hereby invited to provide information”.

</div> However, this too did not bring it outside the scope of Explanation 2(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>). It was, as the words suggest, simply a neutral invitation to provide information.

On that basis, the trial judge excluded the written statement. However, the Court of Appeal observed that the written statement should have been admitted, explaining at [19] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The evidence was quite clear that ASP Lim or any other person in authority did not hold out to the appellant that his mother, Mdm Teng, would not be arrested or would be set free in a day or two if the appellant admitted that the drugs found in the cupboard in Mdm Teng’s room were in fact his. <span class="font-italic">This was the appellant’s own perceived impression</span>.

</div> All of this could be explained by his <span class="font-italic">hope </span>that he would be given a certificate of substantive assistance.

</div> As Jumadi testified, he was initially unwilling to admit to ownership of the Drugs. I find that Jumadi would not have simply believed the Promise allegedly made by SSSgt Fardlie and/or IO Yip, and/or misconstrued the MDP Notice as he was also aware of the new drug law at the time of the raid. I also find it incredible that the Promise and/or the MDP Notice would have caused him to immediately change his mind as to whether to admit to ownership of the Drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Jumadi knew that he was facing the death penalty as he was a drug trafficker with a large quantity of diamorphine in his possession, besides other drugs. He fully cooperated with the CNB officers hoping that they would be lenient to him and not punish him with the death penalty. This was what he told Dr Yeo.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the admissibility of Jumadi’s Statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In conclusion, after the first ancillary hearing, I was convinced that SSSgt Fardlie, IO Yip and SSSgt Hamidah did not offer any inducement, threat or promise to Jumadi. Thus, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Jumadi’s Statements (except for the Eighth Long Statement) were made voluntarily without inducement, threat or promise. No Promise was made to Jumadi and neither did the MDP Notice constitute a promise within the meaning of s 258(3) of the CPC. For these reasons, I admitted the Statements (except the Eighth Long Statement) into evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second ancillary hearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 When Shisham’s counsel sought to adduce Jumadi’s Eighth Long Statement, Jumadi similarly claimed that, before taking his statement, SSSgt Lim had informed him that she was from the CNB. This caused him to think of the Promise made by SSSgt Fardlie, since both SSSgt Lim and SSSgt Fardlie were from the CNB.

</div> In my view, this portion of Salzawiyah’s testimony does not create any doubts as to whether SSSgt Fardlie had read the MDP Notice to Jumadi <span class="font-italic">prior </span>to the recording of the Second Contemporaneous Statement. The fact that the CNB served the MDP Notice on Jumadi but not on Salzawiyah does not, in itself, raise doubts in the Prosecution’s case. The service of the MDP Notice is not a statutory requirement and there could have been a legitimate reason for the CNB to decide not to do so. Since Salzawiyah’s testimony is that she had not been served the MDP Notice, it is of little assistance in so far as <span class="font-italic">when </span>the MDP Notice might have been served. Therefore, it also does not raise any doubts as to the correctness of the court’s decision to admit Jumadi’s Statements. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The amendment of Salzawiyah’s capital charge to a non-capital charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I shall first deal with the amendment of the original capital charge against Salzawiyah to a non-capital charge. The only change in the amended charge is the analysed weight of diamorphine stated in the charge – Salzawiyah is charged for trafficking in “not less than 14.99g” of diamorphine, rather than “not less than 41.86g” of diamorphine (as reflected in Jumadi’s and Shisham’s amended charges).

</div>
</div> The gross weight of the diamorphine specified in Salzawiyah’s present amended charge (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 127 packets containing not less than<span class="font-italic"> </span>3,280.06g of granular/powdery substance found to contain diamorphine) remain the same as in the amended charges against Shisham and Jumadi. Further, the common intention element of the charge remains the same – the alleged trafficking was in furtherance of the common intention of the accused persons. At first glance, this may appear to contradict Jumadi’s and Shisham’s charges, which state that they each trafficked in not less than 41.86g (analysed weight) of diamorphine in furtherance of the common intention of the accused persons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 However, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin </span>[2020] 2 SLR 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Aishamudin</span>”) clarified that under the circumstances there was nothing inherently problematic about the Prosecution bringing such common intention charges in respect of the same criminal act. Nonetheless, the Prosecution must still meet its legal and evidential burden of “proving every element of each charge against <span class="font-italic">all </span>the co-offenders said to share in the common intention that is reflected in the charge in question” [emphasis in original]. Further, the Prosecution’s case against all the accused persons must be consistent, in order to avoid prejudice to the accused persons in the form of procedural unfairness and prejudicial outcomes (<span class="font-italic">Aishamudin </span>at [53] and [55]). In assessing whether the Prosecution’s cases are consistent, the approach is as follows (<span class="font-italic">Aishamudin </span>at [68]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, the following approach may determine whether the Prosecution is running inconsistent cases in respect of any series of charges: when all the facts and arguments which are material to establishing the Prosecution’s case against each of the accused persons are spelled out, would it be possible for all of these facts and arguments to be cumulatively true? Where the answer to this is in the negative, it would seem to point to the existence of a material inconsistency. … In short, the analysis is concerned with whether the Prosecution’s cases are capable of constituting part of a single coherent world of facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On this approach, the common intention element in the charges may appear to be inconsistent if, on the face of the charges, “there is some inconsistency in holding that all the elements of all the charges are cumulatively established” (<span class="font-italic">Aishamudin </span>at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126  In <span class="font-italic">Aishamudin</span>, the Court of Appeal was concerned with facts which are very similar to this case. In that case, the prosecution had charged one accused person, Suhaizam, with trafficking in not less than 32.54g of diamorphine, whereas the other accused person, Aishamudin, had been charged with trafficking in not less than 14.99g of diamorphine (<span class="font-italic">Aishamudin </span>at [10]–[11]). Thus, the analysed weights of diamorphine reflected in the charges were different. However, the items that formed the subject matter of the charges remained the same, specifically, two packets containing not less than 921.5g of granular/powdery substance found to contain diamorphine. Both charges also stated that such trafficking had been carried out in furtherance of the common intention of both Suhaizam and Aishamudin. The Court of Appeal found at [74] that these charges were “capable of constituting part of a single coherent world of facts, namely, one in which Suhaizam and Aishamudin both shared the common intention to traffic in 32.54g (or more) of diamorphine”. In contrast, if the evidence showed that Suhaizam intended to traffic in <span class="font-italic">only </span>14.99g of diamorphine, that would be inconsistent with Aishamudin’s charge. This was because Aishamudin’s charge required a finding that <span class="font-italic">both </span>Suhaizam and Aishamudin intended to traffic in 32.54g of diamorphine (<span class="font-italic">Aishamudin </span>at [75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Similarly, in this case, Salzawiyah’s, Jumadi’s and Shisham’s charges are consistent with each other in so far as they shared the common intention to traffic in 127 packets containing not less than 3,280.06g of granular/powdery substance found to contain diamorphine. In this case, there is no inconsistency in the Prosecution’s cases against the accused persons as the subject matter of the amended charge against Salzawiyah (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 3,280.06g of granular/powdery substance found to contain diamorphine) remains the same as that reflected in the charges against the other two accused persons. Despite the amendment of Salzawiyah’s charge, the Prosecution’s case remains that Salzawiyah, Jumadi and Shisham shared the common intention to traffic in not less than 127 packets containing not less than 3,280.06g of granular/powdery substance found to contain not less than 41.86g of diamorphine.

It is well-established that, in order to make out the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, the Prosecution must prove (see <span class="font-italic">Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 257 at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Abdul Haleem bin Abdul Karim and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 734 at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Raman Se</span><span class="font-italic">lvam s/o Renganathan v Public Prosecutor </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 550 at [35]) that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the accused had possession of a controlled drug (which may be proved or presumed under s 18(1) of the MDA); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the accused had knowledge of the nature of the drug (which may be proved or presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the accused’s possession of the controlled drug was for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In relation to the first element of possession, s 18(1) provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18</span>.–(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The presumption in s 18(1) was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span>”) at [34] as being concerned with secondary possession, that is, “whether the thing in issue [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the container, key or document of title]<span class="font-italic"> </span>exists and whether the accused in fact has possession, control or custody of the thing in issue”. To rebut the presumption in s 18(1), the accused must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have the drug in his possession. For instance, by showing that “the accused did not know that the thing in issue contained that which is shown to be the drug in question” (<span class="font-italic">Obeng </span>at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Furthermore, s 18(4) of the MDA provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where one of 2 or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 There are two critical elements of joint possession under s 18(4) of the MDA – knowledge and consent. In relation to knowledge, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1374 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli</span>”) clarified at [55] and [70] that this refers to “knowledge that the object in the actual possessor’s possession is <span class="font-italic">a </span>controlled drug (as opposed to any specific controlled drug)” [emphasis in original]. In relation to consent, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli</span> summarised (at [52]) the applicable principles from <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2014] 3 SLR 721 (“<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan</span>”) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2014] 3 SLR 721 (‘<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>’), this court held that ‘consent’ required a degree of ‘power or authority’ … over the object in question (at [63]). Mere acquiescence or condonation would not suffice; rather, there had to be ‘some dealing between the parties in relation to the drug, such as an agreement to buy it or help in concealing it’ (<span class="font-italic">Ridzuan </span>at [64], citing <span class="font-italic">Public </span><span class="font-italic">Prosecutor v Lim Ah Poh </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 307 at [71]). As such, a minimal or distant role in the drug transaction would not amount to ‘consent’ under s 18(4) (see <span class="font-italic">Moad Fadzir bin Mustaffa v Public Prosecutor and other appeals </span>[2019] SGCA 73 (‘<span class="font-italic">Moad Fadzir</span>’) at [97]–[98]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 If the first element of possession is proved or presumed, then the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA that the accused had knowledge of the nature of the drug is invoked. In order to rebut this presumption, the accused must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug (see <span class="font-italic">Obeng </span>at [36]). For instance, the accused can show that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug (see <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 2 SLR 903 at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In relation to the third element of such possession being for the purpose of trafficking, s 2 of the MDA defines trafficking as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“traffic” means – </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (<span class="font-italic">a</span>), </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">otherwise than under the authority of this Act, and “trafficking” has a corresponding meaning; </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The element of trafficking was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1003 at [110] as follows:

It follows that a person who holds a quantity of drugs with no intention of parting with them other than to return them to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him does not come within the definition of possession of those drugs ‘for the purpose of trafficking’. There is a fundamental difference in character between this type of possession and possession with a view to <span class="font-italic">passing the drugs onwards </span>to a third party. In the former situation, the returning of the drugs to a person who already was in possession of them to begin with cannot form part of the process of disseminating those drugs in a particular direction – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from a source of supply towards the recipients to whom the drugs are to be supplied – because the act of returning the drugs runs counter to that very direction. On the other hand, in the latter situation, the intended transfer of the drugs to a third party is presumptively part of the process of moving the drugs along a chain in which they will eventually be distributed to their final consumer. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Further, s 34 of the Penal Code states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The three requirements for liability under s 34 of the Penal Code are: (a) there must have been a criminal act; (b) there must have been a common intention between the parties; and (c) the parties must have participated in the criminal act. This was recently explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Aishamudin </span>([125] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [49], citing <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan </span>([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay s/o Katherasan and others v Public Prosecutor </span>[2010] 4 SLR 1119, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 … [T]hree elements must be present before s 34 may be invoked: (a) a criminal act; (b) a common intention between the persons in question; and (c) participation in the criminal act. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) A <span class="font-italic">criminal act </span>in this context has been defined as ‘that unity of criminal behaviour, which results in something, for which an individual would be punishable, if it were all done by himself alone’ … It refers not to the offence that the individuals concerned plan or carry out, but rather, to an act or a continuum of acts – in short, a criminal design … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) A <span class="font-italic">common intention </span>refers to a ‘common design’ or plan, which might either have been pre-arranged or formed spontaneously at the scene of the criminal act … This must be the intention to do ‘the very criminal act done by the actual doer’ … foresight of the possibility of the criminal act is not enough … As this formulation shows, the common intention, strictly speaking, refers not to the intention to commit the offence which is the subject of the charge, but to the intention to do the criminal act, although in many cases, the two will overlap … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The parties to a common intention charge must <span class="font-italic">participate </span>in ‘any of the diverse acts which together form the unity of criminal behaviour resulting in the offence charged’ … It was also recognised in [<span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 447]<span class="font-italic"> </span>that participation may take many forms and degrees, and it was held that whether an accused person’s participation in a criminal act is of a sufficient degree to satisfy the participation element and attract liability under s 34 is a question of fact. In this regard, it was noted too that there is no requirement for an accused person to be physically present at the scene of the criminal act in order for him to be liable under s 34 … </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The amended charge against Jumadi</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Given that Jumadi appears to be the leader/boss of the drug trafficking operation, it is apposite to start with the amended charge against him. Jumadi admits that he had in his possession, for the purpose of trafficking, 14.67g (analysed weight) of diamorphine, and not 41.86g (analysed weight), as stated in the amended charge framed by the Prosecution. Specifically, this 14.67g of diamorphine consisted of the bundles and packets of diamorphine marked A1A1, A1D1, A1E1, A1F1 and B1A1. His defences in relation to the remainder of the Drugs found in the Unit can be divided into two main categories:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The bundles marked A1B, A1C and A2A containing a total of 18.27g of diamorphine were the Three Bundles<span class="font-italic"> </span>that Jumadi claims were mistakenly delivered to him and which he intended to return to Vishu (“the Mistake Defence”). Therefore, Jumadi does not dispute that he had possession of the drugs and knowledge of the nature of the drugs contained in the Three Bundles. The crux of the dispute is whether he intended to traffic in these Three Bundles of diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Jumadi alleges that the packets marked D1A, D2A, D3A, D4A, D5A, E1B1 and E1E containing a total of 8.92g of diamorphine, which were found on Salzawiyah’s bed and inside the closet in the bedroom of the Unit, belonged to Salzawiyah (“the Ownership Defence”). The crux of the dispute here is whether Jumadi had these packets of diamorphine in his possession and intended to traffic in them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Having considered the parties’ submissions and the evidence, I find that the Prosecution has proved the charge against Jumadi beyond a reasonable doubt and I am not persuaded by any of Jumadi’s defences which do not raise any reasonable doubt in relation to the Prosecution’s case. I shall now elaborate on the reasons for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Contradictions between Jumadi’s Statements and his testimony in court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The Prosecution’s case relies largely on Jumadi’s Statements, in which he consistently admitted that the Drugs found in the Unit were in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. This can be seen from the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In his First Contemporaneous Statement, Jumadi admitted that “everything in this house are [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] mine”. This was a clear statement admitting possession of all the Drugs in the Unit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  This was similarly the case for Jumadi’s Second Contemporaneous Statement. When asked about the Bundles and packets of diamorphine in the red bag and camouflage bag, Jumadi clearly admitted that they were “for sale”. He further admitted that the packets of diamorphine found in the bedroom of the Unit belonged to him, some of which were for sale. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Again, in the MDP Notice, Jumadi admitted that “[a]ll the things in this house are mine”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In his Fourth Long Statement, Jumadi stated that the packets of diamorphine marked D1A, D2A, D3A, D4A, D5A, E1B1 and E1A came from the two <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of heroin which he and Shisham ordered on 16 June 2017 and received on 17 June 2017. He explained that these were for sale and belonged to him, although he surmised that E1B1 had probably been packed by Salzawiyah.

In particular, he stated that he had initially only intended to order two <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of diamorphine. However, Vishu suggested that he purchase five <span class="font-italic">batu</span> on credit, such that he only needed to pay $10,000. Jumadi then obtained $10,000 from Salzawiyah, explaining that he needed to “stock up heroin for Hari Raya”. That night, he told Shisham to call Vishu to confirm the purchase of five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of heroin. Shisham did so, and informed Jumadi that the diamorphine would be delivered on 22 June 2017. On 22 June 2017, Shisham and Jumadi duly paid for and collected the five <span class="font-italic">batu</span>, which were all intended for sale.

</div> Furthermore, as I shall elaborate further below, some parts of the Statements that Jumadi sought to disclaim are inconsistent with his allegation about the Promise. Therefore, I reject Jumadi’s assertions that certain portions of his Statements had been given because of the Promise. That being the case, there was no reasonable explanation as to why he would admit that he possessed the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking if this was not actually true.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In so far as Jumadi had hoped to be given a certificate of substantive assistance and was therefore cooperative and forthcoming with the CNB (see [110] above), this would only have encouraged him to tell the truth in his Statements rather than fabricate or omit significant facts as he alleged in court. If he had fabricated his confessions in an attempt to appear cooperative, it is unlikely he would have differentiated between the packets/bundles of diamorphine intended for sale and those intended for his own consumption.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 One of the implications of my decision that the Promise had not been made is that it significantly affected Jumadi’s credibility as a witness. Despite the overwhelming evidence, he was adamant that the Promise had been made and he continued to maintain this position in the main trial even after I had admitted the Statements into evidence after the ancillary hearings. This indicated that Jumadi was prepared to fabricate evidence in order to support his case and avert the capital punishment. In my view, it is essential that Jumadi’s evidence be viewed with extreme caution, especially his testimony in court. Generally, his Statements are more truthful than his testimony in court. The court has to carefully go through Jumadi’s evidence with a fine-tooth comb and discern the truth from the falsehoods.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Inconsistencies in Jumadi’s testimony in court</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Another reason why I place less weight on Jumadi’s testimony in court is because there are serious and material inconsistencies in Jumadi’s testimony in court. This refers to both the internal inconsistencies in Jumadi’s testimony, as well as the inconsistencies between Jumadi’s testimony and the other evidence before the court. This requires the court to discern the grain from the chaff in analysing the truth of Jumadi’s evidence. I shall give several examples of the serious and material inconsistencies and my findings thereon. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Explanation of the First Contemporaneous Statement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 One such material inconsistency pertained to Jumadi’s explanation of the admission contained in his First Contemporaneous Statement. Jumadi sought to explain that when he admitted to owning the drugs “in this house” in his First Contemporaneous Statement, he meant the drugs found in the living room of the Unit and not all the drugs found in the Unit.

</div> These explanations are not borne out by the messages themselves. It is clear from the messages that the parties were discussing the sale and purchase of diamorphine.

Specifically, by June 2017, he was purchasing one to three <span class="font-italic">batu </span>at a time, with purchases of diamorphine made at frequent intervals. This clearly refutes his testimony in evidence-in-chief. In light of this, it is not surprising or out of place that he would order five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>from Vishu to “stock up” for the Hari Raya period, especially since Vishu was prepared to sell the <span class="font-italic">batu</span> on partial credit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The Three Bundles</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Numerous material and irreconcilable inconsistencies also arise in relation to Jumadi’s explanation regarding the Three Bundles. Jumadi’s defence is that he had received the additional Three Bundles from Vishu by mistake. He explained that, when the courier passed the red bag containing the Bundles to him, he did not notice the extra weight of the Three Bundles. According to Jumadi, “[i]t happened so fast because it was in a public area”, therefore, he “took [the red bag] quickly and put it at Shisham’s legs”.

</div> I find this explanation unconvincing. This was not Jumadi’s first time collecting an order of diamorphine, neither was this his first time dealing in <span class="font-italic">batu</span>. He knew that the weight of one <span class="font-italic">batu</span> was approximately 450g.

</div> The difference between two <span class="font-italic">batu</span> (approximately 900g) and five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>(approximately 2.25kg) is far from insignificant.

</div> I find it implausible that Jumadi could have failed to notice this substantial difference in weight simply because he wished to avoid lingering at the collection location. Furthermore, he admitted that he received the red bag from the courier. Thus, he should have noticed immediately the substantial weight difference.

</div> However, he alleged that he took the red bag and placed it near Shisham who was seated at the front passenger seat. This is inconsistent with Jumadi’s Statements detailing his previous collections (which he confirmed in court were true), which show that he was careful and observant when it came to collecting drugs. I give two examples: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 12 June 2017, Jumadi and Shisham went to Marsiling to collect an order of methamphetamine. Shisham left the car and returned with the methamphetamine, which was wrapped in aluminium foil. In that case, Jumadi was concerned that “there [were] many people walking around”. Therefore, he did not open the item immediately. Instead, he took it and pressed it with his fingers to determine if the texture was similar to that of methamphetamine. He then “drove to somewhere quiet” to weigh the item and confirm that it was methamphetamine.

As in the present case, the couriers boarded Jumadi’s car and gave Shisham three “bundles wrapped in black tape” in exchange for the money. After the couriers left the car, Jumadi did not drive back to the Unit because he “felt something amiss”. He noticed that two of the bundles were “packed nicely” while the other was “strangely packed”. He then drove to a car park to open the bundles and weigh them, upon which he realised that he had probably been given less cannabis than he had ordered. He then “nagged at [Shisham] for not weighing the items upon receiving [them] in front of the [couriers]”.

As evident from [158(b)] above, even though he was not the one who physically collected the drugs, he still paid attention and was observant enough to notice that one of the bundles was wrapped differently from the other two.

If what Jumadi said is true and he indeed intended to return all Three Bundles to Vishu, it would have made more logical sense for him to take out the Three Bundles and separate them from the rest of the drugs which were intended for sale.

Third, when it was again pointed out to him that he had almost four hours between the time he allegedly returned back to the Unit and the time the CNB officers arrested the accused persons, he then added that it was also because he had a practice of bringing <span class="font-italic">all </span>of his drugs with him wherever he went. As such, he had intended to bring the red bag and the camouflage bag (and presumably all the other drugs in his possession) with him to the ground floor of the Unit, just to stash the Three Bundles. His explanation becomes absurd and gibberish. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 In relation to the last explanation, Jumadi further explained that:

Secondly, it’s whenever a customer needs the drug, they can order straight from me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In my view, this explanation is also extremely dubious and unconvincing. This practice was not mentioned anywhere else in Jumadi’s Statements or in his testimony in court. It is also not borne out by any of the evidence before the court. To the contrary, in Shisham’s Second Long Statement he stated that, when he and Jumadi left the Unit at 10am in the morning of 22 June 2017, “Jumadi was not carrying anything or any bags”.

</div> Although Jumadi sought to explain this on the basis that Shisham could possibly have wished to distance himself from the drug transaction, I do not see how a statement that Jumadi was carrying bags could incriminate Shisham.

Instead, it only demonstrates the extent to which Jumadi was prepared to fabricate evidence in order to support his case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Finally, in deciding which of the Bundles to return, Jumadi claimed that he selected the Three Bundles as they were smaller bundles.

The inconsistencies are with regard to the details. Specifically, Jumadi stated in his Fourth Long Statement that Salzawiyah had given him the money that he used to purchase the five Bundles. In court, however, he claimed that he had taken the money from an <span class="font-italic">ang pow</span> in a black tray in the bedroom of the Unit.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 However, Jumadi’s first and second explanations are, in fact, mutually inconsistent with his third explanation. His first and second explanations were that he had deliberately lied because he thought that the “truth” would disentitle him to the fulfilment of the Promise or contradict his previous statements. His third explanation, however, was that, at the time he gave his Fourth Long Statement, he could not remember how he had gotten the money so he repeated the <span class="font-italic">modus operandi </span>set out in his previous statements. The third explanation is predicated on a fundamentally different state of mind than the first and second explanations. Moreover, the third explanation is in itself difficult to believe. The Fourth Long Statement was recorded on 4 July 2017, less than two weeks after the events of 21 June and 22 June 2017. By that time, Jumadi would have had some time to collect his thoughts while the relevant facts remained fresh in his mind. In contrast, the trial took place more than three years after the said events. It is incredible that, at the time the Fourth Long Statement was recorded, he could not remember how he had obtained the money used to purchase the Bundles, but his memory was suddenly refreshed when it came to his testimony in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 These vacillating and inconsistent explanations indicate that Jumadi was simply not telling the truth in his testimony in court regarding how he had obtained the money to purchase the five Bundles. Instead, his Fourth Long Statement was much more credible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 On a related note, I shall address Jumadi’s claim that, out of the $10,000 he brought with him to the collection point, only $7,000 was for the purchase of diamorphine and the remaining $2,000 to $3,000 was for other expenses such as petrol, payment of the car rental and purchase of cigarettes, food and groceries (see [33] above). I am not inclined to accept Jumadi’s evidence in this regard. Instead, the amount that he had with him – $10,000 – coheres with Vishu’s offer to him regarding the five <span class="font-italic">batu</span>, as described in his Statements.<span class="font-italic"> </span>This is because the sum of $10,000 would have been sufficient for Jumadi to purchase approximately three and a half <span class="font-italic">batu</span>.

It is not disputed that various calls were made between Shisham’s and Vishu’s mobile numbers on 21 June 2017. Rather, the disagreement is regarding the contents of those phone calls and who had been present when the phone calls were made. According to the Prosecution, the possibility of purchasing five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of diamorphine on credit was first raised in a phone call made between Shisham’s and Vishu’s mobile phone numbers at 4pm. At this time, all three accused persons were in the Unit. After the phone call at 4pm, Jumadi asked Salzawiyah for $10,000, which she gave to him. Later that evening, while Shisham and Jumadi were in separate locations outside of the Unit, Jumadi instructed Shisham to confirm the order of the five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>with Vishu, which Shisham did.

</div> In contrast, according to Jumadi’s testimony in court, the calls with Vishu arranging for the purchase of the two <span class="font-italic">batu</span> of diamorphine was made at 6.57pm, 7.27pm and 11pm. The initial agreement was for the diamorphine to be collected at 9am the next day.

Therefore, Jumadi could not have spoken to Vishu using Shisham’s mobile phone on speaker mode at the times he claimed in his testimony in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In relation to the calls at 6.33pm and 6.34pm, Jumadi explained that, at the time, he might have left the Unit to go to the shop or make deliveries, in which case Shisham would not follow him. It may be a plausible explanation. However, the same cannot be said for Jumadi’s explanation in relation to the text messages. According to Jumadi, the messages between 10.27pm and 10.37pm were “about when [he] was in the toilet” and Shisham had asked him “how long [did he] need to finish [his] business in the toilet”.

</div> If they were indeed in the Unit, which is very small, they would have spoken to each other instead of sending text messages to each other. The messages at 11.13pm onwards were merely to remind Shisham to return to the Unit and check if he remembered what they had previously discussed with Vishu regarding the collection of the diamorphine the next day.

Read in totality, the series of messages clearly show that, between 10.30pm and 11.30pm, Shisham had been waiting for Jumadi to pick him up. When Jumadi was eventually unable to pick Shisham up, he apologised to Shisham and asked Shisham to return to the Unit on his own.

</div> Furthermore, in asking Shisham “[t]omorrow what time?”, Jumadi was not checking to see if Shisham remembered the details of the collection which they had previously discussed with Vishu. Rather, he was asking Shisham for the time of collection of the diamorphine because <span class="font-italic">he did not know what time had been arranged</span>. This is clear from the fact that, when Shisham replied “Ten in the morning”, Jumadi simply replied “<span class="font-italic">Ok</span>… Fire brigade.” This was an acknowledgment by Jumadi, accompanied by the location of the collection. There was no attempt to correct Shisham despite Jumadi’s claim that the collection had been set for 9am the next day. Jumadi sought to explain this on the basis that he did “not want to entertain [Shisham’s] messages” and wanted to scold Shisham in person. However, this directly contradicted his earlier evidence that, if Shisham had gotten the timing of the collection wrong, Jumadi would “inform him the time and … will maybe scold him”.

First, Shisham and Jumadi were not together in the Unit between 10.27pm and 12.30am on 21 June 2017. Therefore, they could not have made the call with Vishu at 11pm as Jumadi alleges. The evidence further suggests that, at around 6.30pm, Jumadi and Shisham were also not together in the Unit.

That evening, by way of a phone call at 6.34pm, Jumadi asked Shisham to call Vishu to confirm the purchase of the five <span class="font-italic">batu</span>. Shisham did so, by way of several phone calls with Vishu between 6.57pm and 11pm.

</div> The Prosecution’s explanation for this was that the tabulation was derived from a series of screenshots from Shisham’s mobile phone. There were two types of screenshots – first, screenshots simply showing a list of the calls to and/or from the mobile phone number, which did not show the duration of each call; second, screenshots showing the calls made with a specific contact, which showed the duration of each call. As only some of the screenshots fell into the second category (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>showed the duration of the calls), only the durations for those calls were indicated in the tabulation.

</div> In relation to the 4pm call in particular, there was no screenshot showing the duration of the call. Therefore, on the face of the tabulation and the screenshots alone, it was not clear whether the 4pm call had in fact connected. In other words, the court could not conclude either way whether the call had connected or whether it had not connected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 During the closing submissions, the Prosecution applied under s 283 of the CPC to adduce further evidence to determine conclusively whether the 4pm call was connected. However, Jumadi’s counsel objected to this.

</div> In my view, it was not necessary to invoke s 283. Section 283 deals with cases where a court decides to “summon a <span class="font-italic">person </span>as a witness or examine a <span class="font-italic">person </span>in attendance as a witness … or recall and re-examine a <span class="font-italic">person </span>already examined” [emphasis added]. In this case, however, the mobile phone had already been adduced and admitted as a court exhibit <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, P463. It was thus entirely within the court’s power to open the court exhibit, P463, and any party could have applied to the court to examine P463 and look at its contents, without the need to examine or recall any further witnesses. In fact, this was precisely what the court did at the beginning of the trial, where some of the physical exhibits were opened and shown to the court and all the parties.

</div> Jumadi’s counsel objected to this on the basis that only the “physical exhibit of the phone” had been adduced as evidence, whereas the contents of the phone had been adduced separately by the Prosecution in the form of a supplementary bundle and it would be adducing fresh evidence.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 With respect, I do not agree with Jumadi’s counsel’s submissions on this. The phone in its entirety had been admitted into evidence. There was no reason why the court and the parties could not look at the contents of the phone, as long as such information was clear from the face of the exhibit itself. This is to be distinguished from information from the phone that requires <span class="font-italic">additional </span>processing by a technician or an expert, such as the reports produced by the Forensic Response Team after a digital forensic examination had been conducted on the phone. In this case, the information regarding whether the 4pm call had connected fell into the former category of information that was apparent from the face of the exhibit. Such information could simply be obtained by turning on the phone, going to the relevant messaging application, clicking on the relevant contact, and seeing from the screen whether the call had connected and its duration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 For completeness, I am also of the opinion that no prejudice would thereby occasion to Jumadi. The Prosecution’s case regarding the 4pm call was made clear to Jumadi in the course of the trial, on the basis that the 4pm call had in fact connected. Thus, Jumadi had been given sufficient opportunity to address the Prosecution’s case on that basis. In any case, Jumadi was the one who first raised the specific issue of whether the 4pm call had connected. Given my earlier observation that the tabulation and screenshots did not point either way (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, could not show whether the call had or had not connected), turning on Shisham’s mobile phone and looking at its contents could potentially have <span class="font-italic">assisted</span> Jumadi in his case that the 4pm call had not connected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Therefore, I authorised the Prosecution to break open the sealed envelope containing Shisham’s mobile phone in the presence of the accused persons’ respective counsel, so that the parties could confirm whether the 4pm call had connected and its duration.

</div> This confirms Jumadi’s Fourth Long Statement that he and Shisham spoke to Vishu using Shisham’s phone at 4pm. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(F) Timing of the collection of the diamorphine on 22 June 2017</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Further inconsistencies arise in relation to Jumadi’s account in court about the time that he and Shisham went to collect the Bundles on 22 June 2017. According to Jumadi’s testimony, it was initially agreed that the diamorphine would be collected at 9am. On 22 June 2017, he and Shisham left the Unit at 8.30am and arrived at Changi South Lane at around 9.02am. They received a call from Vishu at 9.29am asking them to check if they had received more diamorphine than ordered. They returned to the Unit before 10am and, at 9.58am, Jumadi allegedly called Vishu to discuss what to do with the extra Bundles. However, these timings directly contradict those given by Jumadi in his Fourth Long Statement. In his Fourth Long Statement, Jumadi said that they had originally expected to collect the Bundles in the afternoon. At around 9am on the morning of 22 June 2017, Shisham received a call that the Bundles were ready for collection. Jumadi and Shisham left the Unit at about 10am and reached Changi South Lane before 11am. The collection of the Bundles took approximately ten minutes or more, after which Jumadi and Shisham returned to the Unit.

Why?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Because, for example, there was a call at about 9.30am when Vishnu … informed me that there was additional <span class="font-italic">barang</span>.

But I did remember that there was a phone call received from Sham. As such, I just put the timing at 9.00am. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 The explanation, therefore, appears to be that Jumadi made up “random timings” in his Fourth Long Statement so that he would be able to claim the benefit of the Promise. Although Jumadi could not “remember clearly”, he recalled that there was a phone call received by Shisham at around 9am or 9.30am. If he had informed the CNB of the “true” timings, he would have had to explain that the call received by Shisham pertained to Vishu asking him to check if there were additional <span class="font-italic">batu</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 In my view, this explanation does not make any sense. It does not follow that, if Jumadi had informed the CNB that he collected the drugs at 9am, he would have to explain the contents and purpose of the call from Vishu at 9.30am. Those are two separate matters. There was, therefore, no reason to lie about the <span class="font-italic">timing </span>of the collection of the diamorphine. Furthermore, Jumadi’s claim that he made up “random timings” belies the fact that the timings of the relevant events given by Jumadi in his Fourth Long Statement are supported by Salzawiyah’s evidence and the contemporaneous phone records, as follows.

At 10.15am, there was a call from Shisham to Vishu. Between 10.26am and 10.29am, there was a series of missed calls from Vishu to Shisham.

</div> I do not find these points to be of great significance. Although he told Shisham to call Vishu to confirm, it was perfectly plausible that Shisham had not made the call to Vishu if Vishu had called him first. As Jumadi was not present during Shisham’s phone calls with Vishu in the evening of 21 June 2017, he would not have known whether it was Shisham who called Vishu or Vishu who called Shisham.

</div> This is reasonable – Jumadi was not privy to this call as it was between Shisham and Vishu. Furthermore, as I have mentioned, Jumadi did not have the call records for reference when he gave his Fourth Long Statement. Thus, this mistake as to the timing of the call (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, stating that it was 4am although it was probably at 7.12am) is not significant and does not diminish the weight to be given to Jumadi’s account in his Statements regarding the timings of the events of 22 June 2017. Overall, I find that Jumadi’s account in his Statements is not only internally consistent, but also consistent with the other evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 In contrast, Jumadi’s testimony in court regarding the relevant events would not account for the several calls (missed or otherwise) between Vishu and Shisham from 10.15am to 10.52am on 22 June 2017.

</div> If Jumadi had already discussed the necessary arrangements with Vishu in relation to the purported extra Three Bundles by 9.58am, there would not have been a need for any more calls to be exchanged between them. Jumadi could not provide an explanation for these calls – his evidence was that he was not involved in these phone calls. Therefore, he did not know the contents or purpose of such calls.

However, Jumadi was unable to satisfactorily explain why he would lie about the timings of these events in his Fourth Long Statement. His explanation was convoluted and led to further inconsistencies. Moreover, Salzawiyah’s evidence and the contemporaneous phone records contradict Jumadi’s testimony in court.

In his Fourth Long Statement, Jumadi stated that, after he returned from South Changi Lane to the Unit, he “received a call from an Indian guy [named] Baba who asked to buy [two] packets of heroin”. Jumadi told Baba to “meet near the laksa place”. When Baba reached that location, Jumadi told Shisham “to meet one very old Indian guy to pass the [two] packets of heroin to him” and collect payment of $200, and Shisham did so.

</div>  In court, however, he claimed that, while he had received a call from Baba asking to buy two packets of diamorphine, Baba eventually cancelled his order as Jumadi did not agree to lower the price of the diamorphine. According to Jumadi, this discussion took place “[i]n the same conversation, in the first call”. As such, the real reason why Shisham left the Unit was not to deliver diamorphine to Baba, but to survey the location and find a place to hide the Three Bundles.

First, Jumadi’s explanation was inherently contradictory. Initially, Jumadi testified that he never mentioned Baba in his instructions to Shisham, as his instructions concerned surveying the area to find a hiding place rather than asking Shisham to meet Baba.

</div> Jumadi thus vacillated on whether Shisham knew Baba, according to which position best served his defence. This indicates that he was not telling the truth regarding his instructions to Shisham. Second, even if Shisham knew Baba from past transactions, it is extremely unlikely that Shisham would have been able to fabricate an account regarding an Indian man which corresponded so closely to Jumadi’s account of Baba in his Fourth Long Statement, unless such an account of Baba was in fact true or close to the truth.

Of course, there are certain details in Jumadi’s Fourth Long Statement that are omitted from Shisham’s Second Long Statement, including the fact that Jumadi had asked Shisham to pass Baba two packets of diamorphine in exchange for money.

Instead, the account set out in Jumadi’s Fourth Long Statement and in Shisham’s Second Long Statement should be preferred. Specifically, the reason why Shisham had left the Unit was to deliver packets of diamorphine to Baba, and not to find a place to hide the Three Bundles.

</div> Furthermore, and more importantly, s 261(1) provides that the proper inferences may be drawn by the court “in determining – (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) whether to commit the accused for trial; (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) whether there is a case to answer; and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged”. This makes clear that the inferences to be drawn, if any, can only go towards the court’s determination of the three issues mentioned in ss 261(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). These three issues pertain to <span class="font-italic">the accused</span><span class="font-italic"> person who has remained silent</span>, not the co-accused person who has given evidence against the accused person. Thus, s 261 cannot be used in the way contended by Jumadi, that is, to give rise to inferences to be considered by the court in its determination of <span class="font-italic">a co-accused</span><span class="font-italic"> person’s guilt</span> or otherwise.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 I turn now to s 291(3) of the CPC, which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If an accused –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) after being called by the court to give evidence or after he or the advocate representing him has informed the court that he will give evidence, refuses to be sworn or affirmed; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) having been sworn or affirmed, without good cause refuses to answer any question,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the court, in deciding whether the accused is guilty of the offence, may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Section 291(3) applies to an accused person’s election to remain silent upon being called to give evidence in his defence. Thus, it is applicable in this case. However, this provision does not have the effect contended by Jumadi, for the same reason as above. Section 291(3) states that “the court, <span class="font-italic">in deciding whether the accused is guilty of the offence</span>, may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper” [emphasis added]. Therefore, similar to s 261, any inferences drawn can only go towards the court’s determination of whether <span class="font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> accused person who has elected to remain silent</span> is guilty of the offence he has been charged with. The inferences to be drawn cannot go towards the court’s determination of whether <span class="font-italic">a co-accused person</span> is guilty.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 As I have explained above, these provisions are not to be used by the court to draw inferences in determining whether the co-accused person (who has given the evidence) is guilty. Jumadi submits that Shisham’s silence corroborates his evidence. Does this mean that Shisham’s silence corroborates Jumadi’s defence in court or his defence as stated in his Statements? I assume Jumadi meant the former, but I have explained that his account in court is full of untruths. Accordingly, Jumadi’s argument in this respect is completely misconceived and must fail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Conclusion on Jumadi’s Statements and his testimony in court</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 For the above reasons, I am inclined to place less weight on Jumadi’s testimony in court and accord more weight to his Statements. Jumadi was not able to offer a coherent and reasonable explanation for why he would lie or omit information in his Statements. Further, his testimony in court is fraught with numerous material and serious inconsistencies, both internally and with the other evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 In contrast, his Statements are relatively consistent, from his First Contemporaneous Statement recorded on 22 June 2017 to his Seventh Long Statement recorded on 6 March 2018. Compared to his testimony in court, which was given almost three years after his arrest, his Statements were recorded much closer in time to the critical events of 21 June 2017 and 22 June 2017. In fact, his First Contemporaneous Statement and Second Contemporaneous Statement were recorded on 22 June 2017, the very day of his arrest and the collection of the five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>from Vishu. Jumadi’s Cautioned Statement was recorded the very next day (23 June 2017) and most of his long statements were recorded in late June and early July 2017, within two weeks of his arrest. The first three statements, especially the First Contemporaneous Statement and the Second Contemporaneous Statement, are most likely true as the CNB raid was a surprise and unexpected. Jumadi was caught off-guard and unprepared. Thus, he had no time to fabricate or make up a convincing explanation when he was questioned. Furthermore, he was forthcoming and cooperative in making the Statements due to his hope that he would obtain a certificate of substantive assistance. Jumadi’s Statements were also supported by Salzawiyah’s and Shisham’s evidence and/or statements to the CNB, as well as by the contemporaneous evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 For all of the above reasons, I find that, in respect of the issues relating to Jumadi’s knowledge of the Drugs in the Unit and his intentions relating to the Drugs, Jumadi’s Statements are more credible and reliable than his testimony in court, and they should be preferred to Jumadi’s testimony in court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Mistake Defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 My conclusion above disposes of the Mistake Defence. I do not accept Jumadi’s testimony in court that Vishu had mistakenly delivered the five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of diamorphine and that he only intended to traffic in two of the five<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">batu</span>. Rather, I accept the account of the events given by Jumadi in his Statements that, while he had initially intended to purchase only two <span class="font-italic">batu</span>, Vishu subsequently persuaded him to purchase five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>in anticipation of the upcoming Hari Raya holiday and that Vishu was prepared to accept partial payment with the balance on credit terms. Jumadi had thus paid for and collected the five <span class="font-italic">batu</span>, intending to traffic in all of them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 This scenario is logical and convincing as Jumadi was in the illegal business of buying and selling drugs. Vishu was his supplier of diamorphine and was prepared to grant him partial credit terms. Jumadi, being a businessman peddling in diamorphine, would readily accept it as Vishu gave him some credit terms for the purchase. Jumadi’s explanation for rejecting Vishu’s offer was simply that he did not dare sell such a large amount and that he preferred making payment in full in cash as he did not want to be indebted to anyone.

</div>
</div>
</div> This explanation is unconvincing and it shows Jumadi’s desperate attempt to distance himself from the large quantities of diamorphine found in the Unit in order to avert the capital charge. He is prepared to accept and confess to trafficking in diamorphine of an amount that is less than 14.99g, which is a non-capital charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 For these reasons, I find that the elements of Jumadi’s trafficking charge – possession of the drugs, knowledge of the nature of the drugs, and intention to traffic in the drugs – are all satisfied in relation to the five Bundles (marked A1A1, A1B1, A1C1, A1D1 and A2A1) and the three packets of diamorphine marked A1E1, A1F1 and B1A1. These are the packets of diamorphine that were found in the red bag, camouflage bag and the pink box in the living room of the Unit. I shall now deal with the diamorphine found in the bedroom of the Unit, which Jumadi alleges belong to Salzawiyah. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Ownership Defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 In relation to the Ownership Defence, I similarly reject Jumadi’s explanation in court that the sachets/packets of diamorphine found in the bedroom of the Unit belonged to Salzawiyah. He clearly stated in his Second Contemporaneous Statement that the diamorphine found in the bedroom belonged to him, describing them as “old stuffs which have been packed”, some of which were for sale. This is consistent with his statement in his Fourth Long Statement that the sachets/packets of diamorphine found in the bedroom of the Unit belonged to him. He was also able to provide details in relation to these packets of diamorphine. For instance, he explained that these packets of diamorphine had originated from the two <span class="font-italic">batu </span>he ordered on 16 June 2017 and received on 17 June 2017. He explained that Shisham had made the orders by calling Vishu on his phone, after which Jumadi would drive with Shisham to meet the courier at one of two locations, depending on the time. Further, he and Shisham had repacked the diamorphine that he bought into sachets marked D1A, D2A, D3A, D4A and D5A, which were sealed because his “runners had received complaint[s] from their customers that the packet [was] less than 8 grams”. He also explained that he had not packed the sachets of diamorphine marked E1B1, which was likely packed by Salzawiyah.

</div> The packets of diamorphine found in the bedroom of the Unit were out in the open – the packets marked D1A to D5A were found on one of the beds in the bedroom, whereas the packets marked E1B1 and E1E were found in the wardrobe located in the bedroom of the Unit. The Unit was a small one and the accused persons lived in close proximity to one another. I find it difficult to believe that Jumadi would not have known about these packets of diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 In support of his claim that the drugs found in the bedroom of the Unit belonged to Salzawiyah, Jumadi raises several arguments, which I shall address in turn. Firstly, Jumadi submits that, during the recording of the Second Contemporaneous Statement, it was SSSgt Fardlie who had told Jumadi what the CNB officers found in the bedroom of the Unit, prior to which Jumadi did not know that there were drugs in the bedroom. On this basis, Jumadi’s reply in his Second Contemporaneous Statement cannot be relied on to show his knowledge of the drugs in the bedroom prior to his arrest.

</div>
</div> It should be clarified that, although SSSgt Fardlie wrote down the question, “Just now we search the bedroom. We have recovered heroin, ice, Erimin-5, ganja”, he subsequently cancelled this question and wrote down a new question, “Just now when we searched the room, did you see what was found?”.

</div>
</div>
</div> Thus, it is incorrect to say that SSSgt Fardlie had informed Jumadi of the drugs which had been found in the bedroom. That being said, Jumadi’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs could have been due to the fact that he had witnessed the CNB’s search of the bedroom.

</div> Hence, his <span class="font-italic">acknowledgement </span>of the drugs that had been found in the bedroom does not, in itself, show that he knew of the said drugs before his arrest. However, that does not diminish the significance of his subsequent admission that the drugs in the bedroom belonged to him.

</div> I do not find this persuasive. It is notable that the question posed to Jumadi was <span class="font-italic">roughly </span>how much drugs he had to surrender.

</div> I do not find that the evidence supports such a conclusion. I turn first to the messages contained in Salzawiyah’s mobile phone, which relate to two persons named “Rasyid” and “Jingjong”. It is not apparent from these messages that Salzawiyah was running her own drug business. Instead, it appears that she was making deals as an extension of Jumadi’s drug trafficking operation.

Jumadi knew about these orders and she would obtain the diamorphine from Jumadi to sell to these friends. Although Salzawiyah acknowledged in her testimony in court that Rasyid was her “own customer” rather than “Jumadi’s customer”, this must be understood in light of their extensive drug trafficking operation. Thus, Jumadi and Salzawiyah may not know each other’s customers. What is important is to sell the drug rather than to know the identity of the customers. Furthermore, it may be possible that Salzawiyah did not tell Jumadi about Rasyid because she had only recently obtained Rasyid’s contact and she alleged that she had been quarrelling with Jumadi at the time.

</div> Therefore, the totality of the evidence does not support the conclusion that Jumadi did not know about the packets of diamorphine in the bedroom. Instead, he was aware that she would occasionally sell diamorphine to her friends or contacts and he supplied her the diamorphine for that purpose. I should add that, for reasons I shall elaborate on below, I reject Salzawiyah’s claim that she had extricated herself from Jumadi’s drug trafficking operation a few days before 22 June 2017. Instead, I find that she continued to be part of the drug trafficking operation, albeit to a lesser extent (see [277] below). In light of this finding, it is even more improbable that Salzawiyah would have her own customers to whom she sold diamorphine.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Finally, contrary to Jumadi’s submission,

</div> I do not consider it significant that Jumadi’s DNA was not found on the packets of diamorphine found in the bedroom other than exhibits D1 and D5. As Dr Pook Sim Hwee (“Dr Pook”) explained, the fact that a person’s DNA is not found on an exhibit does not necessarily mean that the person did not come into contact with the exhibit. There are several possible reasons for this. For instance, the amount of DNA deposited might have been insufficient for it to be detected, or the DNA could have been degraded.

</div> Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 1 SLR 499 at [82] recognised that “the absence of a DNA trace does not prove that the [accused] did not in fact touch the relevant materials because there might be other possible explanations for this”. Furthermore, Jumadi’s DNA was found on the interior of the wrapping paper containing the packet of diamorphine marked D1A, as well as the interior of the dark-coloured plastic packet containing the packet of diamorphine marked D5A.

</div> In my view, the presence of Jumadi’s DNA indicates that he had come into contact with these packets of diamorphine, and consequently had knowledge of them. In any case, the other evidence set out above, in particular, Jumadi’s own account in his Fourth Long Statement, is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 For these reasons, I also reject Jumadi’s Ownership Defence. Instead, I find that Jumadi knew of the packets of diamorphine found in the bedroom of the Unit and they were in his possession. Jumadi, in his Statements, said these packets of diamorphine originated from the two <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of diamorphine which he received from Vishu on 17 June 2017 and were intended for sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Thus, the elements of Jumadi’s drug trafficking charge – possession of the drugs, knowledge of the nature of the drugs, and intention to traffic in the drugs – are also all satisfied in relation to the packets of diamorphine marked D1A, D2A, D3A, D4A, D5A, E1B1 and E1E found in the bedroom.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on Jumadi’s amended charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 For the above reasons, I am of the view that Jumadi has not raised a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. In fact I find that the elements of the trafficking charge against Jumadi have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Jumadi had actual possession and had actual knowledge of the nature of the Drugs. Given the amount of Drugs that he had in his possession, the presumption of trafficking under s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA applies and Jumadi has not successfully rebutted the presumption. Even without relying on the presumption in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), I find that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Jumadi actually intended to traffic in the Drugs, in furtherance of the common intention of the accused persons, which I shall elaborate on below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The amended charge against Shisham </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 Shisham’s defence against the Prosecution’s case is that of a bare denial entirely – all three elements of possession, knowledge of the nature of the drugs and intention to traffic are in dispute. The critical factual issue is the extent of Shisham’s involvement in the drug trafficking operation – whether he knew and participated in the drug trafficking operation or was simply a drug addict who consumed drugs at the Unit as he alleged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 I shall first deal with a preliminary issue raised by the Prosecution that Shisham’s counsel had “no evidential basis” to put to Jumadi certain questions pertaining to the calls exchanged between Vishu’s and Shisham’s mobile phone numbers, and Shisham’s knowledge of what was communicated between Jumadi and Vishu. This was because Shisham did not give evidence in his defence as he had chosen to remain silent and there was nothing in Shisham’s statements that related to what transpired during the calls.

</div>
</div> With due respect, I do not agree with the Prosecution. It appears that, when the Prosecution refers to “evidential basis”, it is referring to there being some evidence to support the case that is being put to the witness. However, taking the Prosecution’s argument to its logical conclusion, an accused person who does not give any statements and declines to give evidence in court will not be able to put any part of his or her case to the relevant witnesses. That cannot be the case. This is especially when it comes to the cross-examination of the <span class="font-italic">Prosecution’s </span>witnesses – at the time of cross-examination, the defence would not have opened its case and no evidence would have been adduced by the defence. Thus, an accused person (or his counsel) must be permitted to put the accused’s case to the relevant witnesses even when he decides to remain silent subsequently after he is called to enter his defence. However, the court must be mindful that the case that is being put to the witness is one in relation to which the accused person had chosen to remain silent. In examining the case put forth by the accused person, the court must exercise caution and evaluate the accused person’s case in light of all the circumstances, including the extent to which the evidence supports the accused person’s case, and the fact that the accused had chosen to remain silent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 Bearing the above in mind, I find that Shisham knew and participated in the drug trafficking operation along with Jumadi and Salzawiyah, as compared to merely being a passive consumer of drugs in the Unit. This includes Shisham’s participation in the events of 21 June 2017 and 22 June 2017. In coming to this conclusion, I take into consideration the fact that both Jumadi and Salzawiyah, in their statements as well as their testimonies in court, affirmed that Shisham was involved in the drug trafficking operation. This was both in general as well as in relation to the collection of the five <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of diamorphine on 22 June 2017. Jumadi’s and Salzawiyah’s accounts are also supported by the objective evidence, in particular, the messages contained in Shisham’s mobile phone. I shall address these points in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Jumadi’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 The Prosecution relies on several of Jumadi’s Statements to support its case against Shisham.

</div> Illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) states that the “court may presume … that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 Guidance regarding the application of the presumption in illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was provided by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Chai</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([83] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [61], as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Lastly, illus (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to s 116 of the Evidence Act provides that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and that his evidence needs to be treated with caution, not that it must. The presumption is not mandatory but permissive or discretionary and depends on all the circumstances … Whether or not the court should believe the evidence of the accomplice would depend on all the circumstances of the case and the evidence must be tested against the objective facts as well as the inherent probabilities and improbabilities; but where the court did not discern any attempt by the accomplice materially to minimise his own involvement or exaggerate that of the accused and his evidence was found to be consistent as a whole and reliable on a review of the whole evidence, there was no reason why the evidence should be treated as unreliable. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 From the above, it is clear that the presumption in illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is a discretionary<span class="font-italic"> </span>one. Furthermore, whether it is appropriate to apply the presumption in illustration (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is an extremely fact-specific inquiry. The court should consider the internal consistency of the accomplice’s evidence, the consistency of the accomplice’s evidence with the other evidence before the court and whether the accomplice in his evidence was attempting to minimise his involvement or exaggerate that of the accused person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 There is wisdom in this presumption and the court has to exercise caution in considering the evidence of Jumadi and Salzawiyah, even when their evidence is reliable. As far as Shisham’s involvement in the drug trafficking operation is concerned, Jumadi’s evidence (both in his Statements and his testimony in court) is generally consistent and reliable, and he had no reason to implicate Shisham for no reason. Furthermore, Jumadi’s evidence against Shisham is corroborated by Salzawiyah’s evidence and the objective contemporaneous evidence. I shall explain the evidence in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 First, it is clear that, from the outset, Jumadi identified Shisham as the person who provided the contact to the supplier of the drugs, including diamorphine. Not only that, he also detailed the extensive nature of Shisham’s involvement in the drug trafficking operation. This was consistently maintained throughout his Statements, as follows.

Additional information regarding Shisham provided by Jumadi in his long statements should be seen as supplementing his earlier Statements, rather than contradicting them. The only potentially exculpatory portion of Jumadi’s earlier Statements is his statement in his Cautioned Statement that Shisham “does not know that [he] sell[s] big amount of drugs”.

</div> The context in which the Eighth Long Statement had been given was significantly different from the context of Jumadi’s previous Statements. Whereas the previous Statements pertained generally to Jumadi’s drug trafficking operation and Jumadi’s liability in that respect, the Eighth Long Statement focused on the money which Shisham claimed he borrowed from Jumadi. This would have been known to Jumadi. According to SSSgt Lim, she had asked Jumadi whether he knew about the sum of money that had been seized from Shisham. In these circumstances, I accept Jumadi’s explanation that he had lied so that Shisham would be able to keep the money seized from him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 The second instance where Jumadi’s Statements contradict his testimony in court regarding Shisham is in his Cautioned Statement where Jumadi stated that Shisham did not know that he sold a “big amount of drugs”.

</div> Jumadi’s explanation was that he lied in this portion of his Cautioned Statement because he did not want to give the CNB officers the impression that all the <span class="font-italic">barang </span>belonged to Shisham.

</div>
</div> I have already rejected Jumadi’s assertions as regards the Promise. However, putting aside the Promise, it is possible that Jumadi, being the boss of the drug trafficking operation, admitted that all the <span class="font-italic">barang </span>belonged to him so as to mitigate Shisham’s role. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 It is pertinent that, in Jumadi’s Statements and testimony in court where he implicated Shisham, this was not in order to downplay his own role and exaggerate Shisham’s role in the drug trafficking operation. To the contrary, the general tenor of Jumadi’s Statements was that he was the leader of the drug trafficking operation and Shisham usually operated under his instructions. Jumadi’s evidence regarding Shisham’s involvement therefore incriminated himself as well. In these circumstances, there was no reason for Jumadi to lie as regards Shisham’s involvement in the drug trafficking operation. I also consider it significant that, out of all of Jumadi’s eleven Statements, only his Cautioned Statement and the Eighth Long Statement contained these two discrepancies. Weighed against the rest of Jumadi’s Statements relating to Shisham’s involvement, which are consistent with Jumadi’s evidence in court, as well as the objective evidence (which I shall elaborate on below), the two discrepancies in Jumadi’s Eighth Long Statement and the Cautioned Statement are not sufficient to undermine the overall reliability of Jumadi’s evidence regarding Shisham’s involvement in the drug trafficking operation. Thus, I do not place much weight on Jumadi’s assertion in his Eighth Long Statement that Shisham was merely a drug addict and not involved in the drug trafficking operation, or the claim in Jumadi’s Cautioned Statement that Shisham did not know that he was dealing in large quantities of drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 In this regard, the facts of the present case can be distinguished from the facts in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([132]<span class="font-italic"> supra</span>), a case relied upon by Shisham’s counsel.

</div>
</div> In that case, the Court of Appeal found that the statements given by a co-accused, Roszaidi, could not be used to establish that the other co-accused, Azli, knew about the nature of the drugs. This was because Roszaidi’s evidence had “taken two abrupt and inexplicable turns: from absolving Azli of liability to implicating him, and back to absolving him again” (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli </span>at [105]). However, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli </span>can be distinguished from the present case on at least two bases. First, the Court of Appeal had observed that it was “unclear why Roszaidi would have [absolved Azli of criminal liability] if it were not true” and that the discrepancies in Roszaidi’s evidence were “inexplicable” (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli </span>at [103] and [105]). This is not the case here. As explained above, I accept the explanations given by Jumadi in relation to the two discrepancies in Jumadi’s Cautioned Statement and Eighth Long Statement. Second, the Court of Appeal also observed that there was “scant evidence” to support Roszaidi’s account regarding Azli’s involvement in drug trafficking (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamad Azli </span>at [104]). This is also not the case here. As I shall elaborate below, Jumadi’s account of Shisham’s involvement in the drug trafficking operation is supported not only by Salzawiyah’s evidence, but also by objective contemporaneous evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 Shisham also submits that there is a further contradiction within Jumadi’s Fourth Long Statement – while Jumadi stated therein that Shisham had placed the red bag into his sling bag, no sling bag belonging to Shisham was recovered from the Unit by the CNB.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-ceaf01d8-b256-49b1-b444-f39b1cb4aa89" data-toggle="modal" type="button">346</button></sup>

</div> It is correct that no sling bag was <span class="font-italic">seized</span> by the CNB during the raid on the Unit on 22 June 2017. However, this does not necessarily mean that no sling bag existed in the Unit at the relevant time.

</div>
</div> It is notable that the first time any sling bag was mentioned was in Jumadi’s Fourth Long Statement on 4 July 2017. As such, at the time the raid was conducted, the CNB officers could not have known the potential relevance of the sling bag to the charges. This explains why no sling bag was seized from the Unit. In these circumstances, the fact that the sling bag does not form part of the evidence adduced in court does not necessarily mean that there was no sling bag in the Unit. Accordingly, there is no contradiction within Jumadi’s Fourth Long Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 For these reasons, despite my misgivings in respect of Jumadi’s testimony in court regarding the Ownership Defence and the Mistake Defence, I find that Jumadi’s evidence in relation to Shisham is reliable. Unlike his evidence relating to the Ownership Defence and the Mistake Defence, his evidence regarding Shisham’s involvement is consistent as between his Statements and his testimony in court. Further, his evidence regarding Shisham’s involvement would not affect his own personal criminal liability. There is also no reason or motive for Jumadi to falsely incriminate or implicate Shisham. Therefore, he had no ostensible reason to lie in this respect. As I shall elaborate below, Jumadi’s evidence was also supported by Salzawiyah’s evidence, as well the contemporaneous objective evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Salzawiyah’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 I turn now to Salzawiyah’s evidence, which corroborates Jumadi’s evidence.

This was why she believed that Jumadi’s and Shisham’s drug supplier was from Malaysia. Usually, Jumadi and Shisham would collect diamorphine from Shisham’s “friend” together, following which they would repack the diamorphine and sell the diamorphine to their respective clients. Salzawiyah also stated that, on 17 June 2017, Jumadi had asked for her help to pack the diamorphine because Shisham “want[ed] the [diamorphine] fast as he want[ed] to sell the [diamorphine] to his clients”.

</div> It is apparent from the above message that Black was offering to sell diamorphine to Shisham, and this same Black had contacted Shisham on 14 June 2017. This supports Jumadi’s account in his Fourth Long Statement that on 14 June 2017, Shisham informed him that Vishu had asked someone named Black to call Shisham in relation to Jumadi’s and Shisham’s order for 1kg of cannabis.

</div> On 22 June 2017, at least six calls were exchanged between Shisham’s mobile number and Vishu’s mobile number. As Jumadi testified, the phone was placed on loudspeaker mode and Jumadi spoke to Vishu in Shisham’s presence during the calls on 22 June 2017 (see [228(d)] above).

</div> Critically, Shisham’s contention that he was “so high … that he was not aware of what was going on and of the [diamorphine] ordered by Jumadi” is pure speculation and not supported by any credible evidence. To the contrary, Jumadi’s evidence of Shisham’s involvement on 21 June and 22 June 2017, as well as the calls and messages recovered from Shisham’s mobile phone, show that Shisham was paying attention to the discussion between Jumadi and Vishu, and that he had knowledge of the Bundles.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 I turn now to the Notebook used by Jumadi and Salzawiyah to record drug-related transactions. The entries therein support Jumadi’s evidence that the profits of the drug trafficking operation were divided equally between himself and Shisham. A useful example is the entry made by Jumadi on 19 June 2017.

</div> On the left page of the Notebook, Jumadi had written the words “SYAM - $400” and “SYAM HP = $140”. In court, Jumadi explained that these were expenses incurred in relation to Shisham. Below that entry, Jumadi had written “EACH = $1265 – ADY” and “AFTER DEDUCT = 725. SYAM”. Jumadi explained that “Ady” referred to himself, and the figure of $1,265 referred to his share of the profits. On the other hand, the figure of $725 referred to Shisham’s share of the profits. This amount was reached by deducting Shisham’s expenses (amounting to $540 in total) from his share of the profits (amounting to $1,265).

</div> This shows that, contrary to Shisham’s claims in his statements, he received half of the profits of the drug trafficking operation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 Shisham seeks to rely on the fact that none of the entries in the notebooks used by Jumadi and Salzawiyah to record drug-related transactions were made by him. This was confirmed by the Prosecution’s handwriting expert, Mr Yap Bei Sing.

</div> However, I do not find this to be of particular significance. Shisham’s role in the drug trafficking operation, as appears from the evidence discussed above, was not to record drug-related transactions in the notebooks, unlike Jumadi and Salzawiyah. Thus, it is eminently logical that none of the entries in the notebooks were made by him. It does not raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case against Shisham.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 From the above, it is evident that Shisham was not simply a passive consumer of drugs at the Unit. Rather, he played an active role in liaising with drug suppliers including Vishu and Black. Furthermore, he assisted in delivering drugs, including diamorphine, to various locations in Singapore. He also shared in the profits of the drug trafficking operation. These messages and entries are consistent with Jumadi’s and Salzawiyah’s accounts of Shisham’s involvement in the drug trafficking operation, as contained in their statements and in Jumadi’s testimony in court. Given the extent of his involvement in the drug trafficking operation, it can be further inferred that Shisham was similarly involved in the purchase and collection of the Drugs found in the Unit, as Jumadi and Salzawiyah testified. This includes the Bundles which were ordered on 21 June 2017 and collected on 22 June 2017. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Shisham’s statements to the CNB</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 I shall now consider the effect of Shisham’s statements to the CNB, weighed against the evidence I have discussed above. Shisham, in his statements, claimed that his “only involvement” in Jumadi’s drug trafficking operation was to introduce Black to Jumadi by giving Jumadi Black’s phone number. He claimed that the diamorphine and methamphetamine that were found in his jeans were given to him by Jumadi. He also said that Jumadi allowed him to smoke drugs in the Unit for free and he was also allowed to stay in the Unit by Jumadi.

</div> This was one day after the accused persons’ arrests on 22 June 2017. As such, the events of 21 June 2017 and 22 June 2017 should still have been fresh in Shisham’s mind. Having been read the charge against him and the notice pursuant to s 23(1) of the CPC, one would expect Shisham to mention his defence as set out in his subsequent long statements since he was warned that: “If you keep quiet now about any fact or matter in your defence and you reveal this fact or matter in your defence only at your trial, the judge may be less likely to believe you. This may have a bad effect on your case in court”. However, Shisham merely said that he had “nothing to say”.

Jumadi’s and Salzawiyah’s evidence that he was also involved and participated in Jumadi’s drug trafficking activities is more reliable, especially given that their accounts are supported by objective contemporaneous evidence. This explains why Shisham was allowed by Jumadi to stay at the Unit and consume the drugs for free.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Shisham’s alleged lack of financial means</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 Shisham also submits that he could not have been Jumadi’s “partner” in the drug trafficking operation because he did not have the means to do so.

</div> However, this is a bare assertion that is not borne out by any evidence. Apart from the fact that $221.80 was seized from him on the day of his arrest, Shisham did not produce any evidence of his financial situation or testify regarding the same. The fact that only $221.80 was seized from Shisham does not necessarily mean that he was not a partner in this drug trafficking operation. This is only reflective of the amount of money he had on his person at the relevant time. It does not go very far in showing the amount of money he had and the state of his finances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 To the contrary, the evidence that I have highlighted above shows that Shisham not only contributed financially to the drug trafficking operation, he also benefitted financially from it. In particular, Jumadi explained in his Third Long Statement and his Sixth Long Statement that Shisham had contributed to the pool of money used to purchase diamorphine and that Shisham had also received part of the proceeds of sale of the diamorphine (see [226(c)] and [226(g)] above). This is supported by an entry in the Notebook recording Shisham having received his share of the profits of the drug sales after making deductions for certain expenses (see [251] above). I have already explained above the reasons why I find Jumadi’s statements <span class="font-italic">in relation to Shisham </span>reliable. I should add that Shisham has sought in his submissions to offer an alternative explanation for the entries in the Notebook, in particular, that the “expenses” recorded in relation to him could have been for the diamorphine and methamphetamine that he consumed.

</div> First, this explanation is inconsistent with my finding that Shisham received half of the profits of the drug trafficking operation after making deductions for his expenses. Second, and more importantly, there is no evidence at all to support this alternative explanation. Shisham’s counsel did not cross-examine Jumadi or Salzawiyah about this alternative explanation. Hence, it is again pure speculation and I place little weight on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">260 In any case, I emphasise that the critical question is not the state of Shisham’s finances or whether Shisham was Jumadi’s “partner” in the drug trafficking operation – the critical question for the purpose of the amended charge against him is the <span class="font-italic">level of his involvement </span>in the drug trafficking operation. In this regard, the evidence above (including evidence from Salzawiyah and Jumadi and, more importantly, the objective evidence) shows that he was heavily involved in the drug trafficking operation. Regardless of whether he contributed and benefitted financially from the drug trafficking operation, Shisham was involved in liaising with the drug suppliers and making deliveries of the drugs. For these reasons, I am not persuaded by Shisham’s arguments in this regard.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Absence of Shisham’s DNA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 I now turn to the fact that Shisham’s DNA was not recovered from any of the exhibits seized by the CNB and sent for HSA analysis, including the red bag, the Drugs and the weighing scales. Shisham relies on this to submit that he was not involved in the drug trafficking operation and that, contrary to Jumadi’s Statements, he had not helped to pack some of the Drugs.

Given the importance of this issue, at the request of Shisham’s counsel, Dr Pook was recalled as a witness midway through the parties’ closing submissions to testify regarding the absence of Shisham’s DNA on the exhibits seized from the Unit. However, Dr Pook unequivocally testified that the absence of a person’s DNA on an object is not conclusive in showing that the person did not come into contact with that object.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 Therefore, I do not find that the absence of Shisham’s DNA raises a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor </span>[2020] 1 SLR 984 at [128], the DNA evidence “has to be considered as a whole in the context of the coherence of the case advanced by the [accused]”. Similarly, the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Rizwan bin Akbar Husain v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters </span>[2020] SGCA 45 at [96] that the accused’s explanation for the DNA evidence “should not be considered in isolation as a theoretical possibility. Instead, the case must be analysed as a whole in determining whether [the accused’s explanation] could have taken place as a matter of factual probability on the evidence adduced before the court”. While the Court of Appeal in the latter case was examining the possibility of secondary transference, in my view, this approach is equally applicable to the interpretation of DNA evidence in general and the inferences sought to be drawn from the DNA evidence. In this case, while the absence of DNA could <span class="font-italic">theoretically</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>support an inference that Shisham did not come into contact with the Drugs and/or the red bag, such an inference is simply not tenable given the totality of the evidence against Shisham which I have explained above. This includes the statements and evidence of two witnesses as well as the objective, contemporaneous evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on Shisham’s amended charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 Based on the above, the evidence shows that Shisham played a much more active role than simply being a passive consumer of drugs at the Unit. The evidence also shows that, on 21 June 2017 and 22 June 2017, Shisham had been involved in liaising with Vishu in relation to the five Bundles. He also had accompanied Jumadi to collect the Bundles. This is based on portions of Jumadi’s Statements, which he maintained in his testimony in court. Jumadi’s evidence is also corroborated by Salzawiyah’s evidence, which she maintained consistently in her statements as well as in her testimony in court. Importantly, Jumadi’s and Salzawiyah’s accounts of Shisham’s involvement are supported by objective evidence – the messages contained in Shisham’s mobile phone and the entries made in the Notebook. In these circumstances, the observations of Lord Slynn in <span class="font-italic">Murray v Director of Public Prosecutions </span>[1994] 1 WLR 1 at 11 (cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Chai </span>([83] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [82]) are apposite: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]f aspects of the evidence taken alone or in combination with other facts clearly call for an explanation which the accused ought to be in a position to give, if an explanation exists, then a failure to give any explanation may as a matter of common sense allow the drawing of an inference that there is no explanation and that the accused is guilty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Took Leng How v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 70 at [43] cited Prof Tan Yock Lin, <span class="font-italic">Criminal Procedure </span>vol 2 (LexisNexis, 2005) at para 3003 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Where evidence which has been given calls for an explanation which the accused alone can give, then silence on his part may lead to an inference that none is available and that the evidence is probably true … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 Given the weight of the evidence against Shisham, one would expect Shisham to testify and explain the evidence adduced against him, such as his financial situation, his mental state at the time that the Bundles were ordered, and what had transpired at Changi South Lane. The evidence would have been known to him and he could easily have produced evidence or testified in support of those aspects of his defence. Similarly, he was best placed to explain the incriminating phone messages and calls made and received from his mobile phone number. However, Shisham did not do so. He elected not to give evidence in his defence. This was despite the fact that the consequences of such a decision were explained to him not once but <span class="font-italic">twice</span>: once at the close of the Prosecution’s case and again when he indicated that he wished to change his mind about taking the stand. Even then, he was given the opportunity to reconsider his decision (see [53] above). As such, I find that Shisham’s decision not to testify in the face of the abundant evidence against him is extremely telling. It reinforces my finding that he was indeed involved in Jumadi’s drug trafficking operation, as well as the placing of the order with Vishu and the collection of the five Bundles on 21 June 2017 and 22 June 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 For these reasons, I find that the elements of the trafficking charge against Shisham have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Although it is true that Jumadi was the leader of the drug trafficking operation and had the most say and control over it, Shisham was extensively and actively involved in the drug trafficking operation – he assisted in ordering the drugs, collecting the drugs, repacking and making deliveries of the drugs to customers. In particular, he was involved in the ordering and collection of the five Bundles from Vishu. Given the extent of his involvement and participation in the drug trafficking operation, there was sufficient “dealing between the parties” in relation to the Drugs (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Azli </span>([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [52]) such that Shisham knew that Jumadi had the Drugs in his possession and consented to Jumadi having such possession of the Drugs. Thus, Shisham is deemed by virtue of s 18(4) of the MDA to have been in joint possession of the Drugs. Given that s 18(4) is operative, the presumption in s 18(2) arises and Shisham is presumed to have known the nature of the Drugs. Based on my analysis above, Shisham has failed to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities. Even without relying on the presumption, I find that, based on Shisham’s deep level of involvement in the drug trafficking operation, he knew the nature of the Drugs and intended to traffic in them. This intention to traffic in the Drugs was in furtherance of the common intention shared amongst the accused persons. I shall elaborate more on the element of common intention below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The amended charge against Salzawiyah</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 The Prosecution’s case is that, by virtue of her involvement in Jumadi’s drug trafficking operation, Salzawiyah also knew and consented to Jumadi’s possession of the Drugs. She knew the nature of the Drugs and intended to traffic in them. In relation to the Bundles in particular, the Prosecution submits that Salzawiyah gave Jumadi $10,000 in cash in order to purchase the five Bundles. By so doing, Salzawiyah knew and consented to Jumadi’s possession of the Bundles, knew the nature of the drugs contained in the Bundles, and intended to traffic in the Bundles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 In response, Salzawiyah admits liability for all of the Drugs except for the Bundles and packets found in the red bag and the camouflage bag. Specifically, she denies liability in respect of the packets of diamorphine marked A1A, A1B1, A1C1, A1D1, A1E1, A1F1 and A2A1. Her defence as regards this portion of the Drugs is three-fold. Firstly, she is not deemed to be in possession of the Bundles by virtue of s 18(4) or s 18(1) of the MDA. Secondly, in rebuttal of the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, Salzawiyah claims that she did not have knowledge of the nature of the Bundles. Thirdly, she did not have the common intention with Jumadi and/or Shisham to traffic in the Bundles.

To the contrary, the evidence indicates that, despite the purported deterioration in their relationship and her dissatisfaction with the state of affairs at the time, Salzawiyah continued to be involved in the drug trafficking operation. She continued<span class="font-italic"> </span>to make entries in the Notebook relating to drug transactions, although less so than before.

</div> Furthermore, according to Jumadi’s testimony, the calls with Vishu arranging for the purchase of diamorphine was made at 6.57pm, 7.27pm and 11pm on 21 June 2017. At this time, Salzawiyah’s evidence was that she was outside of the Unit, at her late father’s house in Hougang.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 As between Jumadi’s Statements and his testimony in court, I find that Jumadi’s Statements are more credible. As I have explained at [166] and [168] above, Jumadi was not able to provide a satisfactory explanation for why he would lie in his Statements regarding how he obtained the money to purchase the Bundles. Instead, his explanations were vacillating and contradictory. This was similarly the case in relation to his evidence regarding the timing of the calls made with Vishu on 21 June 2017 (see [190] above). In contrast, Jumadi’s Statements are generally consistent with each other, and were made relatively closer in time to the critical events of 21 June 2017 and 22 June 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 I have observed that Jumadi was willing to fabricate evidence to suit his own purposes. In this case, it is likely that Jumadi lied in court for two reasons. First, he was seeking to distance himself from his admission in his Statements that he took $10,000 from Salzawiyah to buy diamorphine, such sum being sufficient to purchase more than three <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of diamorphine (see [170] above).

</div> Second, he also wished to protect Salzawiyah by distancing her from the purchase of the Bundles. It is telling that, in his Statements, Jumadi already sought to downplay Salzawiyah’s involvement in the drug trafficking business in order to protect her. In fact, Jumadi admitted that he had lied in certain parts of his Statements “about Salzawiyah’s involvement in the drug trafficking business … so as not to implicate her”.

</div> The fact that Jumadi took the $10,000 from Salzawiyah to pay Vishu for the five Bundles of diamorphine is consistent with his description of Salzawiyah’s role, both in his Statements as well as his testimony in court. Therefore, Jumadi’s Statements should be believed over his testimony in court, when he said that he obtained the $10,000 from Salzawiyah to purchase the Bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 I am aware that Salzawiyah submits that the notebooks did not contain any record of her giving $10,000 to Jumadi.

</div> the notebooks used by Jumadi and Salzawiyah to record drug-related transactions do not contain <span class="font-italic">any</span> entries of instances when Salzawiyah passed money to Jumadi for Jumadi to purchase drugs. This suggests that, in the first place, Salzawiyah and Jumadi had no such practice of recording down sums of money that Salzawiyah passed to Jumadi in order for him to purchase drugs. Moreover, the record keeping in the notebooks was done haphazardly, crudely and informally. It was not according to proper accounting principles. It appears that the entries in the notebooks were organised according to date. For each date, two pages would be used – the page on the left side would be used to record outgoing moneys (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, expenses), whereas the page on the right side would generally be used to record incoming moneys (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, proceeds of sale of the drugs). Jumadi testified in court that he would sometimes use the page on the right side to record the purchase price of drugs even if he did not subsequently expend the money to buy such drugs. If Jumadi’s explanation is accepted, it means that there could be anomalies in the bookkeeping. Furthermore, Jumadi explained that entries in the notebooks would be made as and when convenient, with the total sums calculated only at the end of the day.

In such a situation, the living room floor would have been the “common vector”, as described by Dr Pook.

</div> Furthermore, they cannot be looked at in isolation but must be read in conjunction with the other parts of Jumadi’s Statements, as well as with the totality of the evidence. Given the evidence which I have discussed above, I place little weight on the fact that Jumadi had admitted in his Statements that all the Drugs in the Unit belonged to him alone. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on Salzawiyah’s amended charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 In relation to the Bundles, I find that Salzawiyah knew and consented to Jumadi’s possession of them, such that she is deemed pursuant to s 18(4) of the MDA to have been in joint possession of them.

Salzawiyah submits that, even if she had handed the $10,000 to Jumadi, she did not know the specific quantity of diamorphine Jumadi was intending to purchase.

</div> However, Jumadi had informed her that he was going to “stock up heroin for Hari Raya”. Furthermore, Salzawiyah was aware that the price of one <span class="font-italic">batu </span>of diamorphine was approximately $3,700, as evidenced from her phone records.

</div> From this, she would have known that $10,000 could purchase about three <span class="font-italic">batu</span> of diamorphine.<span class="font-italic"> </span>This is affirmed by Salzawiyah’s own cautioned statement, where she stated that she knew that Jumadi and Shisham were “going to take ‘batu’” and that they intended to buy a “large amount of heroin”.

</div> Therefore, although she might not have known the precise quantity of diamorphine Jumadi and Shisham were going to buy, she knew that they were going to buy a large amount of a controlled drug, specifically, diamorphine.  Based on the circumstantial evidence, it can also be inferred that she knew Jumadi and Shisham were buying five Bundles of diamorphine on 22 June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 Next, I turn to the element of consent.  I find that Salzawiyah’s conduct in giving Jumadi $10,000 in cash to purchase the diamorphine is sufficient to amount to consent for the purposes of s 18(4) of the MDA. Therefore, Salzawiyah was not only in joint possession of the Bundles, she also knew the nature of the Bundles (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that they contained diamorphine). At this juncture, I address an argument raised by Salzawiyah that she was not the “financier” of the drug trafficking operation and did not have any “power or authority over the money”. According to Salzawiyah, even if she had given Jumadi $10,000 as requested by him (which, as I have found above, she did), such conduct amounted to acquiescence and was insufficient to meet the legal threshold for consent under s 18(4). Therefore, s 18(4) did not apply.

</div>
</div>
</div> I do not accept this argument. The first observation to be made is that, strictly speaking, the power or authority is assessed in relation to the <span class="font-italic">drugs</span>, rather than the money used to purchase the drugs.<span class="font-italic"> </span>That being said, it is possible that a person’s power or authority over the money used to purchase the drugs may also affect that person’s power or authority over the drugs themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">290 Secondly, and more importantly, Salzawiyah did have some measure of control, power or authority over the Bundles. It is true that, based on the evidence, Jumadi was the leader of the drug trafficking operation and the primary decision-maker. It is also true that Salzawiyah gave Jumadi the $10,000 upon his request. However, what is required for s 18(4) is “some measure of <span class="font-italic">control</span>” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan </span>([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [63]) and “a degree of ‘power or authority’” (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli </span>([132] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [52])<span class="font-italic"> </span>over the object in question. Such control, power or authority depends on the dealings between the parties in relation to the drugs and the role that the accused played therein (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan </span>at [64]; <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Azli </span>at [52]). It is evident from the Court of Appeal’s observations in the cases cited above that the control, power or authority need not be <span class="font-italic">absolute</span>; it is always a question of degree. In this case, looking at the dealing between Salzawiyah and Jumadi in relation to the Bundles, Salzawiyah was not only the safekeeper of the proceeds of the drug sales, she also helped to maintain the accounts of the drug trafficking operation. She could almost be regarded as a “treasurer” of sorts. In this context, her passing of the $10,000 to Jumadi can hardly be characterised as acquiescence or passive. Her control, power or authority over the Bundles arose from her critical role in providing Jumadi the money used to purchase them, with the knowledge that such money was going to be used to purchase a large amount of controlled drugs, specifically diamorphine. This is even though such moneys were only being <span class="font-italic">safekept </span>by her rather than belonging absolutely to her. By passing Jumadi the money, she knowingly <span class="font-italic">enabled </span>him to pay for and collect the Bundles. Therefore, I find that she consented to Jumadi’s possession of the Bundles for the purpose of s 18(4) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">291 In relation to the other packets of diamorphine in the red bag and camouflage bag (marked A1E1 and A1F1), I also find that Salzawiyah knew that these were controlled drugs in Jumadi’s possession and that Salzawiyah consented to Jumadi’s possession of them, given her participation in Jumadi’s drug trafficking activities.
