<p class="Judg-1">It is not disputed that the plaintiffs were given opportunity to
                    inspect the originals of the documents listed. Having inspected these accounts,
                    the plaintiffs made the application mentioned above at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> on the ground that the individual documents in each account
                    book were not specifically particularised. They further submitted that they
                    could not properly inspect the documents given that many documents were not in
                    English.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b>The AR’s
                    decision</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The AR dismissed the application, holding that
                    the defendants’ obligation was merely to produce the documents for the
                    plaintiffs to inspect and nothing more; if the plaintiffs sought to rely on
                    those documents, it was instead for the plaintiffs themselves to make the
                    translations. She further held that the defendants had provided the plaintiffs
                    with the documents, bundled according to the accounts for the relevant months,
                    and had given the plaintiffs the opportunity to inspect those
                documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On appeal before me, a sample of the accounts
                    was produced. The accounts for each relevant period are compiled in a loose-leaf
                    manner and bound in a booklet. The contents for each relevant period relate to
                    financial transactions including receipts, invoices and payment particulars
                    partly in English and partly in Mandarin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Order 24 r 9 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) requires a party who has served a list of
                    documents to allow the other party to inspect the documents referred to in the
                    list (other than any which he objects to produce) and to take copies. It is not
                    in dispute that the defendant has complied with those requirements, and the
                    plaintiffs admitted to having sighted “a handful of the Accounts”.
                    Even though they now complain that they “were forced to cease inspection,
                    as the Accounts were incomprehensible”, the fact of the matter is that
                    the plaintiffs had been given discovery and they could have, if they wished,
                    made copies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendants should provide a further and better list of
                documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Order 24 r 3 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>3. —(1</b>)    A list of
                            documents made in compliance with an order under Rule 1 must be in Form
                            37, and <em>must enumerate the documents in a convenient
                                order and as shortly as possible but describing each of them or, in
                                the case of bundles of documents of the same nature, each bundle,
                                sufficiently to enable it to be identified</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The provision for enumerating and describing bundles of documents is
                    an exception – usually, documents must be listed individually. As
                    explained in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>
                    (ed-in-chief GP Selvam) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at
                    para 24/3/5:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The provisions in regard to bundles of documents only apply where
                        there is a large number of documents of the same nature. In such a case,
                        each of the documents must be numbered, as in other cases, but the bundle
                        may be described as whole, <em>eg</em>. “letters
                        (or copy letters) from A to B, tied up in a bundle marked A and numbered
                        from 1 to 50 and initialled by me.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The documents must be of the same nature. Diverse documents though dealing
                        with the same subject-matter or transaction and filed or bundled together do
                        not come within the exception (<em>Sveriges Angfartygs
                            Assurans Faening v The 1976 Eagle Insurance Co. S.A</em>.
                        (March 28, 1990, Hobhouse J., Com.Ct unreported) [<em>sic</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In substance, the plaintiffs’ appeal on
                    this point is that a further and better list of documents ought to be provided
                    because the 30 November List does not comply with the requirements of
                    O 24 r 3, <em>ie</em>, the bundles do not contain
                    documents of the same nature and the description of the bundles is insufficient
                    for the documents to be identified. The plaintiffs submit that the items listed
                    at 101–103 have to be further elaborated with a list of each and every
                    invoice and receipt in each period’s account book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In relation to the above submissions, the issue
                    I have to consider is whether the wording of items 101–103 in the
                    30 November List is sufficient disclosure of the bundles of documents
                    contained in the accounts for each relevant period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>Singapore Civil
                        Procedure 2007</em> at para 24/1/12, it is observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A list of documents, verified by affidavit is normally conclusive
                        … subject to two qualifications, namely: (1) that an application may
                        be made under r.5, for an affidavit in regard to specific documents or
                        classes of documents, where the facts fall within that rule; and (2) that an
                        application may be made for a further and better list of documents in the
                        following conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An order may be made for a further and better list of documents where it
                        appears (1) from the list itself, or (2) from the documents referred to in
                        it, or (3) from admissions made either in the pleadings of the party making
                        discovery or otherwise, that the party making discovery has or has had other
                        relevant documents in his possession, custody or power. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The relevant considerations behind the
                    discovery process is to ensure the conduct of litigation in an efficient,
                    economical and expeditious manner that is consistent with doing justice between
                    the parties (see <em>Averiges Angfartygs Assurans Forening v The
                        1976 Eagle Insurance Company SA &amp; Ors</em> 28 March 1990
                    Unreported (QBD Comm Ct)). My attention was also drawn by counsel to the
                    following passages in the Australian case of <em>DCH Legal Group
                        v Skevington &amp; Anor</em> [2001] WADC 116
                        (“<em>DCH</em>”), per Muller DC at
                    [8]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where reliance is placed on disclosure of a bundle of documents the
                        description of documents in that bundle must be reasonably precise.
                        Discovery in bundles is acceptable provided the description of each bundle
                        accurately and adequately describes its contents and specifies the dates
                        between which the correspondence was produced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A balance must be struck between the duty to identify bundles of documents
                        adequately to enable their ready identification by the other party to the
                        litigation and the protection of the party making discovery upon being
                        overborne or oppressed by the magnitude of the task.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>DCH</em>, the list of documents produced
                    was held to be unsatisfactory because the description of the bundles of
                    documents did not enable the documents in each individual bundle to be readily
                    identified as a class. In fact, the descriptions were found to be misleading and
                    unhelpful on many occasions. There were documents in the individual bundles that
                    were found not to be documents of the same nature as those described by the
                    general title of the bundle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the present case, the account books are
                    originals of the accounts KingHope for the relevant periods. They contain, as
                    would be expected, a compilation of all receipts and invoices that constitutes
                    the accounts of such company in the possession of the defendants. By contrast to
                        <em>DCH</em>, having examined the original accounts
                    bundles presented to me, I conclude that they do indeed correspond entirely to
                    reflecting the financial receipts and invoices for the relevant periods as would
                    be expected in a bundle described as accounts for these periods. I am
                    accordingly of the view that there has been sufficient compliance with O 24
                    r 3 as all items in this bundle constitute documents of the same nature. I
                    do not accept the plaintiffs’ submission that because there are receipts
                    and invoices, these are necessarily diverse documents (though dealing with the
                    same subject-matter or transactions) that do not come within the exception as
                    set out in para 24/3/5 of <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2007</em> (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). It is
                    therefore my view that the accounts books for each period which contains the
                    relevant receipts and invoices constitutes an accurate and adequate description
                    of the contents and the periods of such items.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the defendants are obliged to translate the documents in the
                30 November List</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The second issue before me is whether the
                    defendants are obliged to translate the items in each of the account books for
                    the plaintiffs at <em>this stage</em> of the discovery
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The AR referred to Registrar’s Appeal
                    No 134 of 2009 and held that the onus for translation lies with the party
                    who relies on the relevant documents in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiffs submit that notwithstanding the
                    existence of authority to the contrary, the court ought to order translations of
                    each item of the accounts in the list of documents pursuant to O 92
                    r 3. They submit that this court can and must order the translation to be
                    done. However O 92 r 1 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Every document if not in the English language must be accompanied by a
                        translation thereof certified by a court interpreter or a translation
                        verified by the affidavit of a person qualified to translate it <em>before it may be received, filed or used in the
                            Court</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As it remains uncertain, at this discovery stage, whether or not some
                    or all of the accounts will be received, filed or used in court, I see no reason
                    to prematurely order translation pursuant to O 92. I also agree with the AR
                    that the onus for translation lies with the party who relies on the relevant
                    documents for the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the light of the above, I dismiss the
                    appeal and award costs to the defendants, to be taxed or agreed.</p>
