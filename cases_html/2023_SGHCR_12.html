The defendants contend that Malaysia is the more appropriate forum for the dispute in OC 163 to be tried. The applications raise, among other things, two questions for consideration. First, in ascertaining whether personal connections exist between the dispute and a competing forum, is the court limited to the facts contained in the affidavits filed for the stay application? Secondly, can an arbitration agreement give rise to a connecting factor <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the jurisdiction identified as the seat of the arbitration for the purposes of a court proceeding that is the subject of a stay application on <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>grounds, where that court proceeding pertains to a dispute coming within the scope of the arbitration agreement and where it had been commenced in circumstances which did not constitute a repudiatory breach of the arbitration agreement? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The claimant, Chang Chee Kheo (“Chang”), is a Malaysian citizen residing in Johor Bahru.

The third defendant, Fatfish Capital Limited (“FCL”), is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and is also a subsidiary of FGL.

The PNs were entered into on three separate occasions, and they were each for a term of 12 months. Upon the maturity of each PN, Chang was entitled to a return of the principal with interest. The PNs were extended upon maturity – in the case of the first two of the three PNs (which I refer to respectively as “PN1” and “PN2”), they were extended twice, while the remaining PN (which I refer to as “PN3”) was extended once.

</div>
</div>
</div> On 19 April 2023, the Defendants filed a defence challenging the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts in respect of OC 163 pursuant to O 6 r 7(4) of the Rules of Court 2021 (“the ROC 2021”). Shortly after, FIPL and FCL filed SUM 1518, and FGL filed SUM 1517. In this judgment, I refer to both summonses as “the Stay Applications”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Stay Applications</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Defendants’ position in the Stay Applications is that Malaysia is the more appropriate forum for the determination of the claims in OC 163, for two main reasons. First, the transactions underlying the PNs had nothing to do with Singapore, and everything to do with Malaysia – the deal was struck in Malaysia, Chang transferred the monies in Malaysian Ringgit from his bank account in Malaysia to FV, a Malaysian-incorporated company, and the relevant contractual documents were all prepared and signed in Malaysia. Secondly, there are material<span class="font-italic"> </span>factual disputes in OC 163 in connection with which the evidence of Tay and Chai, both of whom are located within and compellable only in Malaysia, will be critical. These factual disputes include <span class="font-italic">why </span>the transactions in each of the PNs have been structured in the way they had, which in turn bears on the contractual intention of the parties to the PNs and whether the Defendants ought to be liable for the transactions in the manner claimed by Chang in OC 163. The connections of Tay and Chai, which are a weighty factor, point to Malaysia as the more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On the other hand, Chang’s position is that Singapore is the forum with which the dispute in OC 163 has closest connection, because of two weighty connections that render Singapore the more appropriate forum: the Arbitration Clause, which shows that the parties had agreed to Singapore as the more appropriate forum; and the governing law clause, which provides that Singapore law is to be applied to disputes arising from or in connection with the PNs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Chang also has two points in response to the Defendants’ submissions. First, he disagrees that the location of Tay and Chai is a material consideration.  He argues that the two affidavits filed in the Stay Applications by the defendants do not raise any material disputes of fact on which the evidence of Tay and Chai will be required or will be essential. Instead, based on what the Defendants have identified as their likely defences in the affidavits, the key issues in OC 163 are legal in nature, and in any case, even if these issues raise questions of fact, the evidence of Tay and Chai would not be material. Chang also argues that there is also no evidence that Tay and Chai are unwilling to testify at a trial of OC 163 in Singapore, and to the contrary, it is likely that they would be willing to testify in Singapore against the Defendants. Secondly, the fact that the transactions took place in Malaysia is not in and of itself a significant consideration, unless the Defendants can show that having Chang’s claims tried in Malaysia will occasion the least expense and inconvenience. In any case, the locations of the transactions are immaterial to the key issues in dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The principles in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd </span>[1987] AC 460, which were approved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span>”) (at [12]), govern an application for a stay of proceedings on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. There are two stages in the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> analysis. At the first stage, the court will determine, by reference to connecting factors that link the dispute with the competing jurisdiction(s), whether there is some other available forum which is more appropriate for the case to be tried. These connecting factors include: (a) the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses; (b) the connections to relevant events and transactions; (c) the applicable law to the dispute; (d) the existence of proceedings elsewhere or <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span>; and (e) the shape of the litigation (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span>”) at [71]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 If the court concludes at the end of the first stage that there is a “more appropriate” forum, a stay will ordinarily be granted, unless the court finds, at the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis that there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay be refused, such as if the claimant establishes with cogent evidence that it will be denied substantial justice if the case is not heard in the forum (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> at [68]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 At the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spilliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, the legal burden is on the applicant for a stay to show that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [53]). To this end, what the stay applicant must show is that there are connecting factors pointing <span class="font-italic">away</span> from Singapore and <span class="font-italic">towards</span> a foreign jurisdiction as the more appropriate forum (<span class="font-italic">Siemens AG v </span><span class="font-italic">Holdrich Investment Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1007 (“<span class="font-italic">Siemens AG</span>”) at [7]). It is not enough for the stay applicant to just show that Singapore is not <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>(see <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 (“<span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd</span>”) at [26]). Hence, even if there might be few, or even no, substantive connecting factors pointing to Singapore, that does not necessarily mean an applicant would have discharged the burden that is placed upon it under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [53]).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 At the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, the search is for those connections that have the most relevant and substantial association with the dispute (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70]). Thus, greater weight may be ascribed to those connections that are material to the fair determination of the dispute, and those which have little or no bearing on the adjudication of the issues in dispute will generally carry little weight (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [71]; <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [41]). Accordingly, I will focus on those connecting factors which are in contention given the parties’ submissions, namely, the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses, the connections to relevant events and transactions, and the applicable law to the dispute. I do not propose to elaborate on the remaining factors, namely, <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span> and the shape of the litigation which, based on the parties’ submissions, do not appear to be in issue, save for the following brief observations that I make for completeness: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In this case, there is no <span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span>, or the existence of an action or suit pending in another jurisdiction between the same parties and involving the same or similar issues (see <span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span><span class="font-italic"> Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1097 at [26]). This is because OC 163 is undisputedly the <span class="font-italic">only </span>action that so far has been commenced in connection with the disputes involving the PNs. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As for the shape of the litigation, which is a question of how the claim and defence have been pleaded and whether that points to Singapore or elsewhere as a more appropriate forum (see <span class="font-italic">Trisuyo</span><span class="font-italic"> Garuda Nusa Pte Ltd v SKP Pradiksi (North) Sdn Bhd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 814 at [39]), it is generally of more significance in complex litigation involving multiple issues and multiple parties, and the court has regard to this factor with the aim of avoiding the fragmentation of the litigation and ensuring that the dispute is adjudicated in the jurisdiction in which it may be more appropriately determined (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2016 Resissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span>”) at para 75.095). I do not find this factor engaged in this case, as Chang’s claim in OC 163 is unlikely to give rise to complex litigation since it involves a single cause of action premised upon the PNs, where FIPL is sued in its capacity as a borrower, while FCL and FGL are sued in their capacities as guarantors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Accordingly, the Stay Applications raise the following issues for determination:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, whether the connecting factors identified by the Defendants – namely, the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses, and the location of the events and transactions – point to Malaysia as the more appropriate forum? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, whether the connecting factors identified by Chang – namely, the governing law clause in the PNs and the Arbitration Clause – point to Singapore as the more appropriate forum? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, in the light of my views on each of the connecting factors discussed under the first and second issues, whether the Defendants have discharged their legal burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis in demonstrating that Malaysia is the more appropriate forum, and if so, whether there are any reasons by which a stay ought to be refused? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In terms of analysis, if the first issue is determined <span class="font-italic">against</span> the Defendants, then it follows that the Defendants would have failed to discharge their legal burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spilliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, and the Stay Applications would necessarily have to be dismissed, irrespective of whether the connecting factors identified by Chang have the effect of pointing towards Singapore as the more appropriate forum. It is only if the connecting factors identified by the Defendants point to Malaysia as the more appropriate forum will I have to consider the strength of the connections pointing to Singapore, in determining the normative weight to be given to each connecting factor in the circumstances of the case and the jurisdiction which these connections identify as the more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the connecting factors identified by the Defendants point to Malaysia as the more appropriate forum? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I start by considering the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses, before turning to the connections arising from the location of the events and transactions relating to OC 163 as identified by the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Personal connections of the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Defendants submit that the personal connections of the parties point towards Malaysia as the more appropriate forum.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Claimant’s Written Submissions at para 26. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In my view, the personal connections of the parties do <span class="font-italic">not</span> point towards Malaysia as the more appropriate forum. First and foremost, in the circumstances of this case, I do not think it was sufficient for the Defendants, in support of their contention that FIPL has connections to Malaysia, to barely assert that FIPL has business operations in Malaysia without any further substantiation. This is because FIPL is a Singapore-incorporated company, and its operations and affairs are also subject to the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) and its relevant subsidiary legislation. The natural inference arising from FIPL’s status as a Singapore-incorporated company is that it has a place of business in Singapore. For the Defendants to satisfy the court that FIPL’s place of business is in Malaysia and <span class="font-italic">not</span> Singapore, despite it being a Singapore-incorporated company, surely the Defendants must do more by way of adducing of evidence as to what those business operations in Malaysia entailed and precisely where in Malaysia they were located, other than a bare assertion to that effect. Accordingly, I am not persuaded, on the basis of the material in the Defendants’ affidavits, that FIPL’s place of business is in Malaysia and not Singapore. The Defendants’ case on this connecting factor therefore fails on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Secondly, even if I were to accept that FIPL has business operations in Malaysia, this still does not point to Malaysia as a more appropriate forum. Bearing in mind that FGL and FCL are respectively Australian and BVI entities, it remains the case that the personal connections of the parties are dispersed across various jurisdictions, namely Malaysia, Australia and the BVI, <span class="font-italic">other than Singapore</span>. This means that the personal connections of the parties are incapable of pointing to any particular jurisdiction as a more appropriate forum than Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In any case, I do not find the personal connections of the parties to be a factor of significant weight in this case. Parties in modern commercial litigation are often well connected, with relational and business ties to many different jurisdictions (see <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([13] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70]). The mere fact that an entity is resident or has business operations in a particular jurisdiction, does not in and of itself<span class="font-italic"> </span>render that jurisdiction a more appropriate forum, unless the stay applicant can show that any connections thereby arising are<span class="font-italic"> </span>substantial in the light of the likely issues in the dispute. In this case, other than merely asserting that FIPL’s place of business is in Malaysia, the Defendants have not demonstrated to me the significance of that connection, for example, that FIPL’s alleged place of business in Malaysia had something to do with the transactions under the PNs and which in turn render any dispute arising from those transactions more appropriately determined in Malaysia. Therefore, even if the personal connections of the parties did point to Malaysia, it would be accorded little to no weight in the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Personal connections of the witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The personal connections of witnesses encompass two distinct factors: (a) first, the physical location of the witnesses and the convenience in having the case decided in the forum where they are ordinarily resident; and (b) second, the jurisdiction in which a witness is compellable to give evidence (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([15] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [63]). Generally, the physical locations of witnesses are of less significance today given the ease of travel and the possibility of that witness giving evidence by video-link (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [63]; <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra </span>[2019] 2 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span>”) at [72]). On the other hand, because a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify in court proceedings in Singapore (see, for example, O 15 r 4(3) of the ROC 2021, which requires that an order for a witness to attend court or to produce documents be served on the witness by personal service <span class="font-italic">in Singapore</span>), that a witness is compellable to testify in a particular jurisdiction points to that jurisdiction as the more appropriate forum (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [71]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 There are two further points of principle to note in connection with the issue of compellability. First, it generally assumes significance where the main disputes in the action revolve around questions of fact, so that there would be savings of time and resources if the trial is held in the forum in which the witnesses reside and where they are clearly compellable to testify (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw </span>at [19]). Secondly, it generally focuses on third-party witnesses not in the employ or control of the parties to the dispute, because these are the witnesses who the parties may not be able to persuade to give evidence voluntarily in the absence of their compellability (see <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili, </span><span class="font-italic">Bidzina and others v Credit Suisse Trust Ltd </span>[2020] 2 SLR 638 (“<span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [84]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 With these principles in mind, I turn to the submissions. The Defendants argue that there are material disputes of fact arising in OC 163, in connection with which Tay and Chai are material witnesses. This is because Tay and Chai, who are the brokers of Chang’s investment in FIPL, were instrumental in structuring the transactions and their evidence is needed on why the transactions under the PNs have been structured in the way they had. According to the Defendants, Tay and Chai would be able to give evidence on matters like how Chang came to know of the Defendants, what they (Tay and Chai) had told Chang, what Chang understood of the transactions, and how the transactions under each of the PNs had been carried out.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In arguments, the Defendants’ counsel emphasised that the transactions relating to the PNs could not be as simple as what Chang’s pleaded claims in OC 163 suggest, because if it did simply involve a claim to recover investment monies and interest as Chang’s pleaded case suggests, then Chang could have simply entered into an agreement with the entity that he had paid (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, FV), instead of entering into such an elaborate arrangement under the PNs which provided for FIPL (which is not the entity that received payment) to make repayment and for FGL/FCL to act as guarantors. The main point which the Defendants’ counsel appears to make is that the agreement between Chang and the Defendants is contained in something other than the PNs, and because of their role as brokers, Tay and Chai would know and hence be able to give evidence on what the terms of that agreement are, and why those terms had been put in place. The material disputes of fact which the Defendants allude to in their submissions therefore appear to be those relating to the terms of the transactions pursuant to which the claims in OC 163 have been made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, the level of detail in the Defendants’ submissions is absent from the two affidavits they have put forward in the Stay Applications – one filed jointly by FIPL and FCL, and the other filed by FGL (“the Affidavits”). The material in the Affidavits relating to the issue of personal connections of witnesses cover two main areas: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the defences that each of the Defendants would likely mount. For FIPL, it is stated that it would be “(a) challenging the purported issuance and validity of [the PNs]; and (b) disputing the alleged terms in relation to payment”. For FCL, it is stated that, because FCL had not been a signatory or party to PN1B, PN2B and PN3A, it would be “challenging the allegation that it is a corporate guarantor of [FIPL’s] liabilities”.

</div> For FGL, it is stated that FGL had only been a guarantor of FIPL’s liabilities under PN1A, PN2A and PN3, and by virtue of the entire agreement clause found in the Term Sheet (see [5(b)] above), its obligations as a guarantor would have been discharged following the entry into of PN1B, PN2B and PN3A between Chang and FCL.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the evidence that Tay and Chai could give, which includes how Chang came to learn about FIPL, the materials and documents that Chang had received from the brokers, what the brokers had said to Chang, what Chang understood of the PNs, where the transactions were carried out, and the purpose of the transactions. This largely mirrors what the Defendants have said was the evidence that Tay and Chai could give in their submissions (see [26] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is therefore not apparent from the Affidavits that the Defendants are asserting that material disputes of fact exist, and further,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the evidence of Tay and Chai would be critical to these disputes of fact. The question arising is whether I am limited to the Affidavits alone or can additionally take into account what was said by the Defendants’ counsel in submissions in assessing the personal connections of Tay and Chai and their due weight in the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the court is limited to the affidavit evidence in determining if a material dispute of fact exists and/or if the evidence of a witness is critical  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Whether a material dispute of fact <span class="font-italic">exists</span> as a state of affairs is a <span class="font-italic">fact</span> that the stay applicant must make good in discharging its legal burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. That a material dispute of fact <span class="font-italic">exists</span>, which in turn renders the personal connections of particular witnesses relevant,<span class="font-italic"> </span>is a fact on which the stay applicant relies to persuade the court that the identified jurisdiction is a more appropriate forum. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Siemens AG</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([15] above) (at [6]), “the existence of a fact which shows that a jurisdiction is <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span> is a question of fact, and the party who alleges the fact bears the burden of proving it”. The burden is therefore on the stay applicant to <span class="font-italic">prove </span>that a material dispute of fact <span class="font-italic">exists</span>. This could be done, for instance, by a reference to the factual circumstances which it intends to rely on, which on its face contradicts the factual position taken by the claimant. Since the issue of whether a material dispute of fact <span class="font-italic">exists </span>is a matter to be proven, the factual circumstances on which the stay applicant relies in support of the position that such a state of affairs exists must necessarily be deposed to in an affidavit. It would be inappropriate, as a matter of principle, for the court to have regard to matters that have not been stated on oath, in determining if a material dispute of fact exists. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Also, as the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([25] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [86] and [94]), whether the evidence of a particular witness is critical to a defendant’s defence requires a consideration of the following: (a) <span class="font-italic">what </span>is the evidence that the defendant will require to establish its defence; and (b) <span class="font-italic">what </span>is the evidence from that particular witness located within a foreign jurisdiction that the defendant will require for that purpose, which the defendant would be deprived of and hence suffer prejudice if it were required to run its defence in Singapore, where that witness will not be compellable to give evidence. These are similarly questions of fact that the stay applicant must make good, in order to persuade the court that the identified jurisdiction in which that witness resides is a more appropriate forum. The facts on which the stay applicant relies in support of its position on these matters must therefore also be deposed to in an affidavit. It similarly would be inappropriate, as a matter of principle, for the court to have regard to matters that had not been stated on oath, in concluding that the evidence of a particular witness is indeed critical.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I should emphasise, however, that none of what I have said above requires the stay applicant to commit itself to a particular position in respect of its defences to the claim, which I accept would be impractical at a stage when it is not yet required to file a defence on the merits in the action (see O 6 r 7(4) of the ROC 2021). Rather, the point here is simply that the <span class="font-italic">matters </span>on which a stay applicant relies in support of its contention that a jurisdiction is <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> – for example, that material disputes of fact exist or that the evidence of particular witnesses are critical to its defence – must be stated on oath, since these are facts going towards the discharge of its legal burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. This approach is also consonant with the Court of Appeal’s caution in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([15] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [67])<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a defendant applying for a stay should not be permitted to assert, without substantiation, that it requires foreign witnesses, because that would make it easy for defendants to manufacture a connecting factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Defendants have shown that a material dispute of fact exists and/or that the evidence of Tay and Chai are critical to their defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Accordingly, the issues of whether the Defendants have shown that a material dispute of fact exists, and/or that the evidence of Tay and Chai are critical to their defence, are to be determined by reference to the Affidavits alone. I therefore proceed on this basis in considering these issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For FGL, I agree with Chang’s submission that the issues arising from FGL’s defence are largely legal in nature and there are minimal factual disputes. This is because, in so far as FGL is concerned, the Affidavits do <span class="font-italic">not </span>allude to any version of events or facts which contradict that put forward by Chang in his pleaded case, and the <span class="font-italic">only </span>point made by FGL in the Affidavits is that its obligations as a guarantor of FIPL’s liabilities, which existed under PN1A, PN2A and PN3, would have been discharged by the entire agreement clause contained in the Term Sheet.

</div> Thus, on the basis of the Affidavits, the only issue raised in respect of FGL is whether the Term Sheet had the effect of superseding any guarantee arrangements made in the previous PNs, thereby discharging FGL’s obligations as a guarantor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 For FCL, the only point made in the Affidavits is that it had not been a signatory or party to PN1B, PN2B and PN3A, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the latest extended versions of each of the PNs.

</div> The Defendants then clarified that FCL’s position is that no consideration had been provided by Chang in respect of its obligations as a guarantor under PN1B, PN2B and PN3A. That, however, is not stated anywhere in the Affidavits. That being the case, there is no basis for me to conclude that a material dispute of fact exists, in so far as FCL is concerned. In any case, since it is not in dispute that Chang did remit the investment monies under each of the PNs to FV (see [4] above), any contention about consideration would appear to raise a legal issue as to whether payment to FV constituted good consideration for FCL’s promise to guarantee FIPL’s repayment obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 For FIPL, I accept that the defences which it has stated it likely will raise to Chang’s claims in OC 163 – namely, a challenge to the purported issuance and validity of the PNs and a dispute over the terms in the PNs relating to payment

However, because FIPL has not provided any details as to the factual circumstances which it intends to rely on in support of these defences, such as how and/or why it seeks to challenge the issuance and validity of the PNs and dispute the payment terms under the PNs, there is nothing before me suggestive of the evidence that FIPL will require in running its defence. That being the case, there is no basis for the court to conclude that the evidence that FIPL will require in running its defence can <span class="font-italic">only </span>be obtained from a foreign jurisdiction, for example, from a witness compellable in that jurisdiction.

</div> However, that Tay and Chai can give evidence of some relevance to the issues in dispute is not conclusive. What is needed, in order to establish that they are critical witnesses, is that the evidence they can give is that which the Defendants will require to establish their defence to the claims in OC 163 (see <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([25] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [94]). Because the Defendants have not provided any indication on the factual circumstances which FIPL intends to rely on in support of its intended defences to the claims in OC 163 (see [35] above), there is no basis on which I can conclude that the matters which Tay and Chai can testify to corresponds to the evidence that FIPL will require in establishing its defence. Given my view that there appears to be no material disputes of fact in so far as FGL and FCL are concerned (see [33]–[34] above), there is similarly no basis on which I can conclude that the matters which Tay and Chai can testify to corresponds to the evidence that FGL and FCL would require in establishing their respective defences which, as I have noted earlier, appear to raise legal rather than factual issues. In other words, the Defendants have not satisfied me that they would be prejudiced by the unavailability of evidence from Tay and Chai if OC 163 were tried in Singapore. In these circumstances, I am unable to conclude that Tay and Chai are witnesses critical to the Defendants’ defences, and the fact that they are compellable only in Malaysia does not give rise to a connecting factor for the purposes of the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For completeness, however, let me also consider this issue on the basis of what the Defendants have relied on in their submissions, which is that the agreement between Chang and the Defendants is contained in something other than the PNs, the terms of which Tay and Chai would be privy to given their role in brokering the transactions (see [26] above). Obviously, if the Defendants take the position that the <span class="font-italic">actual terms </span>governing their relationship with Chang is found elsewhere other than in the Terms of the PNs relied on by Chang, a material dispute of fact exists. However, it is not obvious to me why the Defendants would require the evidence from Tay and Chai in establishing this position, which is the critical element that must be made out for the Defendants to satisfy me that Tay and Chai are critical witnesses. I accept that Tay and Chai, by virtue of their role as brokers, would be aware of the alleged <span class="font-italic">actual terms </span>of the transactions, but would Chang and the Defendants’ representatives involved in the transactions not be similarly privy to these alleged <span class="font-italic">actual terms</span>, given that there is no dispute that Chang and the Defendants were parties to the transactions? Since the Defendants would be able to rely on evidence, other than that from Tay and Chai, to prove the alleged actual terms of the transactions, I am not satisfied that the Defendants will <span class="font-italic">require</span> evidence from Tay and Chai in establishing what they say is their intended defences, and any prejudice caused to them in the absence of such evidence is minimal to none. Therefore, even if the matters relied on by the Defendants in their submissions were considered, I would have come to the view that they do <span class="font-italic">not</span> show that Tay and Chai are witnesses critical to the Defendants’ defences, and I would still <span class="font-italic">not</span> have considered the personal connections of Tay and Chai as relevant for the purposes of the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For completeness, I note that, while there are other actors in the dispute not resident in Singapore, such as FIPL’s Chief Executive Officer/Director Lau Kin Wai, there has been no issue raised about the compellability or location of these other witnesses. In any case, these witnesses, who are in the employ of the parties to OC 163, would likely be willing to testify voluntarily (see <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([25] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [84]). The parties have not regarded the connections of these other witnesses as relevant for the purposes of the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, and consistent with that, I also do not consider those connections. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Tay and Chai’s purported willingness to testify in Singapore against the Defendants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Finally, I deal with Chang’s submission that there can be no issue of compellability in connection with Tay and Chai, since they are both <span class="font-italic">willing </span>to testify against the Defendants. In the light of my views above, this issue is moot, but I address it for completeness given the submissions that have been made.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 As a starting point, the court proceeds on the basis<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the compellability of a witness is in issue, unless shown otherwise by evidence of the willingness of the foreign witness to testify in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Sinopec International (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Bank of Communications Co Ltd </span>[2021] SGHC 245 (“<span class="font-italic">Sinopec</span>”) at [90]). Thus, in order for Chang to satisfy me that the compellability of Tay and Chai pose no issue, Chang must adduce evidence that Tay and Chai are willing to testify at a trial of OC 163 in Singapore. What Chang has provided in his reply affidavit for the Stay Applications falls short of the requisite evidential threshold. In respect of Tay, there is only Chang’s assertion that he remains in regular contact with Tay, and that Tay had assured him over the phone that he (Tay) is willing to testify in Singapore, if need be.

</div> In submissions, the Defendants’ counsel clarified that the location of the transactions is significant in that Malaysia is where the relevant witnesses and the relevant documentary evidence are located. However, the Defendants did not identify with precision in the Affidavits what the alleged documentary evidence entailed. For instance, it is unclear if those documents would simply be the documents relating to the PNs, most of which would have been exhibited in Chang’s reply affidavit for the Stay Applications. At the hearing, the Defendants’ counsel added that these documents consist of written communications, taking the form of either WhatsApp messages or e-mails, exchanged between: (a) the brokers themselves; (b) the brokers and Chang; and (c) the brokers and FV, which received the investment monies remitted by Chang. The Defendants’ counsel also said that there would <span class="font-italic">presumably </span>be a “Term Sheet” governing the relationship between the brokers and the Defendants in connection with the fund-raising exercise to which the PNs relate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I have several difficulties with the position taken by the Defendants. First and foremost, it suffers from the same fundamental defect as that afflicting the Defendants’ position on the personal connections of Tay and Chai, because no part of the Affidavits identifies or specifies what exactly is the documentary evidence that the Defendants say is located within Malaysia. None of what the Defendants’ counsel informed me at the hearing, relating to the WhatsApp messages or e-mails as well as the alleged “Term Sheet” between the brokers and the Defendants is identified or raised in the Affidavits. The only reference in the Affidavits to “documents” is “certain documents” which Tay and Chai had “procured for [Chang] to sign and execute … in Malaysia”.

</div> There is no elaboration as to what these documents are and why they are located within Malaysia. That relevant documentary evidence <span class="font-italic">exists</span>, and that they are exclusively located <span class="font-italic">within Malaysia</span>, are facts which the Defendants must prove in discharge of their legal burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis that Malaysia is a more appropriate forum (see [29] above). The Affidavits are therefore plainly inadequate in so far as these facts are concerned. There is simply no material by which I can conclude that there is relevant documentary evidence located within Malaysia. That being the case, the location of the events and transactions do not give rise to a connecting factor for the purposes of the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Secondly, even if I were to accept that the alleged documentary evidence exists and that they are located within Malaysia, the Defendants have not explained to me why these documents are critical to their defences. In order for the stay applicant to satisfy the court that the location of certain documents gives rise to a relevant connecting factor, it must also explain how those documents contain evidence that it would require in establishing its defence, of which it would be deprived and hence prejudiced if a stay was refused and the dispute was tried in Singapore. It cannot suffice for the stay applicant to point to these documents in the abstract and make bare assertions as to their relevance. In this case, since the Defendants have not explained or stated in the Affidavits the evidence that they would likely require in establishing their intended defences, it follows that no explanation had been given in the Affidavits as to why the alleged documentary evidence contains evidence required for their defences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Finally, even if the location of the documentary evidence were a relevant connecting factor, I do not think much weight can be given to it in the circumstances of this case. The location of documents becomes a relevant connecting factor if the disclosure of documents can <span class="font-italic">only </span>be obtained in the jurisdiction in which it is located; beyond those situations, documentary evidence is generally transportable between jurisdictions (see <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([25] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [98]). In this case, it is not suggested by the Defendants that the documentary evidence they have identified cannot be transported from Malaysia to Singapore. Importantly, most of the documents identified by the Defendants in their submissions would presumably be in electronic format, such as the WhatsApp chat records and e-mail correspondence. The location of where these communications took place is therefore nothing but a red herring. It is also important to note that these documents, even if unavailable in electronic format, would generally be within the possession, custody or control of the parties to OC 163, and this would also apply to the alleged “Term Sheet” governing the relationship between the Defendants and brokers. It therefore stands to reason that, even if these documents were presently located within Malaysia, the parties would arrange for them to be transported to Singapore, in support of their respective case or defence at a trial of OC 163 in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the connecting factors identified by Chang point to Singapore as the more appropriate forum? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For the applicant to succeed in obtaining a stay on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, it must show that there are connecting<span class="font-italic"> </span>factors pointing <span class="font-italic">away </span>from Singapore towards a foreign jurisdiction as the more appropriate forum; the strength of the connections between the dispute and Singapore does not in and of itself have a bearing on whether the competing jurisdiction identified by the stay applicant is the more appropriate forum (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Sinopec</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([40] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [180]). Given my conclusion above that the connecting factors identified by the Defendants do <span class="font-italic">not </span>point to Malaysia as the more appropriate forum, the Defendants have failed to discharge their legal burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spilliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, and it follows from that alone that the Stay Applications are to be dismissed, irrespective of the effect of the connecting factors identified by Chang. The second and third issues therefore do not arise for consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 However, given the arguments that have been made by the parties on these connecting factors – governing law and the effect of the Arbitration Clause – I set out my views on them in this section.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Arbitration Clause </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 To the best of my knowledge, there appears to be no direct authority on whether an arbitration agreement can give rise to a connecting factor <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the jurisdiction identified as the seat of the arbitration in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis. This is unsurprising because, if there is an arbitration agreement, parties are obliged to resolve disputes combining within that agreement by arbitration, and in the event that court proceedings are commenced in respect of such disputes, the other party to the arbitration agreement would apply for a stay of those proceedings. It is only in the specific circumstances of this case (see [56] below) that the effect of an arbitration agreement in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis arose for consideration.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What effect should an arbitration agreement have (if at all) in the </span>forum non conveniens<span class="font-italic"> analysis?</span><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Where a non-exclusive jurisdiction agreement identifies a foreign jurisdiction as the chosen forum, the defendant seeking to stay proceedings commenced in Singapore may rely on the non-exclusive jurisdiction clause as indicative that the foreign jurisdiction is a more appropriate forum than Singapore in the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis (see <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo Enterprises Ltd v Liu Ming </span>[2019] 1 SLR 779 (“<span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span>”) at [88(b)]). In this context, the non-exclusive jurisdiction agreement provides a basis for the court to infer that the parties had agreed that the foreign jurisdiction identified therein is <span class="font-italic">an</span> appropriate forum (see <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo </span>at [87]; <span class="font-italic">UBS AG v </span><span class="font-italic">Telesto Investments Ltd and others and another matter </span>[2011] 4 SLR 503 at [118]; <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya Putra </span><span class="font-italic">Kundur Indah v Guthrie Overseas Investments Pte Ltd </span>[1996] SGHC 284 at [64], cited in Yeo Tiong Min, “The Contractual Basis of the Enforcement of Exclusive and Non-Exclusive Choice of Court Agreements” (2005) 17 SAcLJ 306 (“<span class="font-italic">Enforcement of Choice of Court Agreements</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 81; see also Richard Fentiman, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Litigation </span>(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2015) at para 2.242). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the other hand, where proceedings are commenced in Singapore in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction agreement identifying a foreign jurisdiction as the chosen forum, the proceedings in Singapore are to be stayed, unless “strong cause” for refusing a stay is shown by the party commencing those proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span><span class="font-italic"> Overseas (Singapore) Pte Ltd v PTT International Trading Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1271 (“<span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span>”) at [71] and [112]). Where exclusive jurisdiction agreements are concerned, the court is concerned with the need to give effect to party autonomy by upholding the parties’ bargain on the forum in which they have agreed for their disputes to be resolved (see <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [72] and [115]). The appropriateness of the chosen forum would therefore not have been a consideration where the case concerns an exclusive jurisdiction agreement. Nonetheless, in my view, it would be fair to say that the exclusive jurisdiction agreement also provides a basis for the court to infer that the parties had agreed that the chosen jurisdiction is <span class="font-italic">the </span>more appropriate forum, to the exclusion of all other competing fora. This is because the exclusive jurisdiction agreement, as Professor Yeo explained in <span class="font-italic">Enforcement of Choice of Court Agreements </span>(at paras 15–16 and 20), has a derogation function, namely, it specifies that the chosen court is the <span class="font-italic">only </span>court that should hear the case, and that all other courts should <span class="font-italic">not </span>hear the case. That is not to say that the exclusive jurisdiction agreement necessarily results in the chosen forum being designated as <span class="font-italic">the </span>more appropriate forum, because the question of appropriateness ultimately turns on an analysis of all relevant factors under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. All I say is that, if an exclusive jurisdiction agreement ever featured in the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis as a connecting factor, its weight must be significant because the agreement therein is not only that the chosen forum is <span class="font-italic">an </span>appropriate forum, but further, that it is <span class="font-italic">the </span>appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Two broad points of principle that are relevant for present purposes may be summarised from the above. First, the basis on which a jurisdiction agreement comes to have effect in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis is contractual. In other words, a particular jurisdiction comes to be regarded as an appropriate forum by virtue of a jurisdiction agreement, only because the parties intended it be so. In other words, if the jurisdiction agreement is to have any such effect, it must not have been brought to an end at the time when the court proceedings in question were commenced. Secondly, the weight that is to be accorded to the jurisdiction agreement in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis would in principle depend on whether it is indicative of the parties’ contractual intention in relation to <span class="font-italic">an </span>appropriate forum or <span class="font-italic">the </span>more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 With the above in mind, I now turn to consider what effect, if at all, an arbitration agreement should have in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis. First, in my view, an arbitration agreement <span class="font-italic">can</span> give rise to a connecting factor <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the jurisdiction identified as the seat of the arbitration in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis. This is because, an arbitration agreement not only specifies the <span class="font-italic">mode </span>by which the parties’ disputes are to be resolved, it also, by reference to the jurisdiction designated as the seat of the arbitration, identifies <span class="font-italic">where </span>the parties intended for their dispute to be resolved. In other words, it identifies a jurisdiction that, by virtue of the parties’ agreement, had a relevant and substantial association with disputes coming within the scope of the arbitration agreement. That the arbitration agreement provides for the dispute between the parties to be resolved other than by way of court proceedings is immaterial for present purposes, provided there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that a claimant would not be allowed to justify court proceedings in a particular jurisdiction by relying on an arbitration agreement and thereby circumvent the arbitration agreement (see [54] below)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Secondly, any such connecting factor that an arbitration agreement gives rise to would ordinarily have significant weight in the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. This is because an arbitration agreement, like an exclusive jurisdiction agreement, has a derogation function, by “deselecting” all the other venues of dispute resolution save for that which is specified in the arbitration agreement (see <span class="font-italic">Enforcement of Choice of Court Agreements</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 27). The arbitration agreement therefore reflects, not only the parties’ intention on the <span class="font-italic">exclusive </span>mode by which disputes coming within the scope of that agreement are to be resolved, but also their intention that such disputes should <span class="font-italic">not </span>be resolved in any other jurisdiction, save in the jurisdiction that has been designated as the seat of the arbitration. In other words, an arbitration agreement is indicative of the parties’ contractual intention in relation to <span class="font-italic">the </span>more appropriate forum for the resolution of their disputes. That, however, does not mean that the identified jurisdiction is necessarily <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> because the question of appropriateness ultimately turns on an analysis of the other relevant factors under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis (see also [50] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Finally, like a jurisdiction agreement, an arbitration agreement’s effect in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis is founded upon its contractual nature, meaning that it identifies a jurisdiction as an appropriate forum in the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis only because the parties intended it be so. This has two consequences. First, the dispute that is the subject of the court proceeding for which a stay is sought on <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>grounds must come within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Second, at the time when that court proceeding was commenced, the arbitration agreement must not have been brought to an end and must remain in force and continue to be binding on the parties. Put simply, the claimant’s commencement of court proceedings must not have given rise to a repudiation of the arbitration agreement that was subsequently accepted by the defendant so that the arbitration agreement is brought to an end (see <span class="font-italic">Marty Ltd v Hualon Corp (Malaysia) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd (receiver and manager appointed) </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1207 (“<span class="font-italic">Marty Ltd</span>”) at [51]). On this note, it is relevant to note the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Marty Ltd </span>(at [54]) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… parties who enter into a contract containing an arbitration clause can reasonably expect that disputes arising out of the underlying contract would be resolved by arbitration and indeed have a contractual obligation to do so. Thus, where court proceedings are commenced without any accompanying explanation or qualification and the relief sought will resolve the dispute on the merits, the defending party in the court proceedings is entitled to take the view that the party who commenced those proceedings (‘the claimant’) no longer intends to abide by the arbitration clause. <span class="font-italic">It would, however, still be open to the claimant to displace this </span>prima facie<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">conclusion by furnishing an explanation for commencement of the court proceedings, either on the face of the proceedings themselves or by reference to events and correspondence occurring before the proceedings started which showed objectively that it had no repudiatory intent in doing so</span>. But in the absence of any explanation or qualification, the commencement of court proceedings in the face of an arbitration clause is, in our view, sufficient to constitute a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>repudiation of the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The effect of the Arbitration Clause </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In this case, whether the Arbitration Clause has any effect in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis turns on whether the arbitration agreement therein had been repudiated as a result of Chang’s commencement of OC 163. I should also add that there is no dispute that the subject matter relating to the claims in OC 163 come within the scope of the Arbitration Clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my view, the events occurring before the commencement of OC 163 show that Chang had no repudiatory intent in commencing OC 163, and so the arbitration agreement in the Arbitration Clause had not been repudiated by the commencement of OC 163. First, it is important to note that this is not a case where a claimant had commenced court proceedings <span class="font-italic">instead </span>of arbitration; Chang <span class="font-italic">had </span>in fact commenced arbitration first, and it was only when the Defendants’ participation in the arbitration was not forthcoming that Chang refused to pay further deposits requested by the SIAC which eventually led to the arbitration being withdrawn.

The Defendants stress that it was Chang <span class="font-italic">himself </span>who discontinued the arbitration by ceasing to pay the deposits required by SIAC. That much is undisputable, but the fact is the Defendants did <span class="font-italic">not </span>participate in the arbitration, and in those circumstances, it was not unreasonable for Chang to decide to cease prosecution of the arbitration and commence OC 163 instead. The Defendants sought to explain their non-participation in the arbitration by saying that they never received the Notices of Arbitration and letters from SIAC.

</div> In these circumstances, I am of the view that Chang had a good explanation for commencing OC 163, and his commencement of OC 163 did not constitute a repudiation of the arbitration agreement contained in the Arbitration Clause. I need only add that, <span class="font-italic">after </span>OC 163 had been commenced, Chang’s solicitors had informed the Court at a Registrar’s Case Conference that Chang was prepared, on certain conditions, to stay the proceedings in OC 163 pending arbitration.

</div> Although conduct post-commencement of court proceedings is not immediately relevant for present purposes (see <span class="font-italic">Marty Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([54] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [54]), it reinforces my conclusion that Chang had <span class="font-italic">not </span>acted with repudiatory intent in commencing OC 163. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Accordingly, I agree with Chang that the Arbitration Clause has the effect of identifying Singapore as a more appropriate forum in the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, and by virtue of what I have said above (at [52]–[53]), it is to be given significant weight as a connecting factor. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The governing law of the PNs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I now come to the last connecting factor raised in the Stay Applications – the governing law clause of the PNs, which provide that “all acts and transactions of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Singapore”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The governing law of the dispute is a connecting factor that points to the courts of the jurisdiction from which that system of law originates as the more appropriate forum because there will clearly be savings in time and resources if a court applies the laws of its own jurisdiction to the substantive dispute (see <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd </span>([15] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [63]; <span class="font-italic">Sinopec</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([40] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]). This starting point, however, is subject to two qualifications. First, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the court proceeds on the basis that the law in the foreign jurisdiction is no different from Singapore law (see <span class="font-italic">Sinopec </span>at [78]). This is because if foreign law is not proved, the content of foreign law will be presumed to be the same as the law of the forum (see <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Chem Orchid” </span>[2015] 2 SLR 1020 at [159]). Second, if the legal issues raised in the dispute are straightforward, or if the competing forum has domestic laws which are substantially similar to those of the forum, little weight is given to the governing law as a connecting factor (see <span class="font-italic">CIMB</span><span class="font-italic"> Bank Bhd </span>at [61]; <span class="font-italic">Sinopec </span>at [79]). Taken together, both these qualifications mean that, if a party seeks to persuade the court that a particular forum is more appropriate by virtue of it being a court in the system of law identified as the governing law, it must show that the content of those laws are of such nature that only courts of that system of law will be adept in applying them, thereby producing cost savings if trial takes place there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 With these principles in mind, I turn to the facts of the present case. The claimant submits that the governing law clause is the most significant connecting factor that points to Singapore as the more appropriate forum because Chang’s claim in OC 163 is relatively straightforward with no substantial disputes of fact, and that the likely issues in OC 163 are mostly legal in nature, given the defences which the Defendants have identified in the Affidavits.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Claimant’s Written Submissions at paras 19, 22 and 23. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I have two difficulties with this submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 First, the fact that the claims are straightforward and raise mostly legal issues does not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>render the governing law a weighty connecting factor for the purposes of the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis. The governing law of the dispute assumes significance because the familiarity<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the courts in a jurisdiction with that system of law means the dispute can be tried with least expense and inconvenience in that jurisdiction. The fact that the dispute raises mostly legal issues or involves straightforward claims do not have a bearing on that consideration. If the legal issues raised are straightforward, and if the laws of the competing foreign jurisdiction are no different from those of the forum, then all other things being equal, the action may be tried in either jurisdiction with no appreciable distinction in expense or inconvenience. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Secondly, I do not think there is enough material for the court to conclude at this stage that Chang’s claims would raise mostly legal issues. Whether Chang’s claims are indeed straightforward would depend on the defences that the Defendants ultimately put forward, if those claims proceed in the Singapore courts. As the Defendants have not provided much detail about precisely what defences they intend to run (see [36] above), there is no basis for the court to draw conclusions at this stage about the likely issues in OC 163, and whether they would be largely legal in nature. In any case, the fact that these issues are largely legal in nature do not <span class="font-italic">per se </span>make Singapore a more appropriate forum, for the reasons that I have explained earlier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In this case, the burden is on Chang, who seeks to argue that Singapore is a more appropriate forum than Malaysia by virtue of the governing law clause, to show that the part of Singapore law applicable to the PNs is unique to Singapore and hence distinct from that under Malaysian law. In the absence of proof that Singapore law differs from Malaysian law in this aspect, the court would proceed on the assumption that both Singapore and Malaysian law is identical on this count. Therefore, Chang has not shown, by virtue of the governing law clause, that having the dispute tried in Singapore will produce savings in time and resources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, in the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the governing law clause constitutes a connecting factor pointing towards Singapore for the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, when it is seen together with the Arbitration Clause. This is because the parties have, by their choice of governing law and also by the Arbitration Clause, regarded Singapore as the jurisdiction with the most substantial and relevant connections with the dispute in OC 163. Therefore, while the governing law clause does not have much weight as a connecting factor if seen in isolation, when taken together with the Arbitration Clause, it has the effect of identifying Singapore as the more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As mentioned earlier, it follows from my conclusion on the first issue that the Defendants have failed to discharge their legal burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spilliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, and for that reason alone, the Stay Applications are to be dismissed. In these circumstances, there is also no need for me to consider the third issue, namely, the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, a point which was not dealt with in much length in arguments anyway. I should also emphasise that my reasons and conclusion on the second issue are <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>because, once I conclude that the Defendants have failed to discharge their legal burden under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis, the Stay Applications are to be dismissed, and the strength or otherwise of the connections between OC 163 and Singapore do not have a bearing on that result. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I will separately deal with the costs of the Stay Applications at a hearing to be fixed by the Registry. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Perry Peh<br/>Assistant Registrar</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Patrick Ong Kok Seng and Kimberly Lim (Patrick Ong Law LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chu Hua Yi and Goh Jia Jie (FC Legal Asia LLC) for the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
