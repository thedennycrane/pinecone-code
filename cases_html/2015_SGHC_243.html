<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by Tienrui Design &amp;
                    Construction Pte Ltd (“the plaintiff”) to set aside an
                    adjudication determination (“the AD”) made pursuant to the
                    Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“SOP Act”). G &amp; Y Trading &amp; Manufacturing Pte Ltd was
                    the defendant (“the defendant”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing arguments, I dismissed the
                    application and awarded costs fixed at $5,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to
                    the defendant. I now set out the grounds of my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The background facts are as
                follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties were at the material time involved
                    in a building project to convert an existing office building into a hotel at 33
                    Jalan Afifi (Geylang Planning Area) (“the Project”). The plaintiff
                    was the main contractor for the Project. By a contract in writing dated
                    19 December 2012 (“the Contract”), the plaintiff engaged
                    the defendantas its sub-contractor to supply and install timber doors
                    (“the Works”). The contract was for the sum of
                $399,280.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the course of the Project, the
                    defendant’s performance was allegedly sub-par. The plaintiff complained
                    that the defendant performed parts of the works poorly, failed to rectify the
                    defects in its works and failed to complete other parts of the works. The
                    defendant attributed its poor performance to its poor financial situation. In
                    view of this, the plaintiff agreed to increase the frequency of payments
                    (“the Variation Agreement”). This was evidenced in the
                    plaintiff’s email dated 6 April 2013 where the plaintiff
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, in order to help your financial issues; [<em>sic</em>] we have decided to omit the down payment as stipulated
                        in your contract and converted to verify based on work done on site,
                            <em>every 2 weeks</em> with necessary
                        documentations supported together with your submission of progress
                        claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Under the original payment terms of the
                    Contract, the defendant was required to submit its payment claim to the
                    plaintiff before the 30th of each month and the plaintiff was supposed to issue
                    an “interim certificate” with respect to the defendant’s
                    payment claim by the 25th of the subsequent month. The relevant clauses are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>14</b>.    
              <b><u>PAYMENT</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The Sub-Contractor shall submit to the Contractor
                            before the 30<sup>th</sup> of each month (Month M) a
                            request for payment in the form to be agreed with the Contractor showing
                            the estimated value of the Sub-Contract Works executed up to the end of
                            that month unless in the opinion of the Sub-Contractor such values and
                            amounts together will not justify the issue of an Interim
                            Certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The Contractor will issue an interim certificate
                            with respect to the above claim by 25 [<em>sic</em>] of the subsequent month (Month M+1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The Contractor’s Interim Certificate to the
                            Sub-Contractor will show the amounts which have been accepted for
                            payment by the Contractor taking into account the real progress achieved
                            during the month less a deduction of retention money at the rate of ten
                            percent (10%) of the value of the Interim Payment up to a maximum
                            retention of five percent (5%) of the Sub-Contract Price and less any
                            back charges due by the Sub-Contractor to the Contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Despite the increase in payment frequency, the
                    defendant’s performance remained sub-par. That led to the termination of
                    the Contract on 28 August 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Prior to the termination of the Contract, on
                    19 August 2014, the defendant served payment claim no 1
                    (“the Payment Claim”) for work done between March 2013 and July
                    2014. The total amount claimed was $85,580.05. On 27 August 2014, the
                    plaintiff responded by way of payment response no 1 (“the Payment
                    Response”) which stated that the plaintiff did not owe any amount to the
                    defendant and that the defendant was actually indebted to the plaintiff in the
                    amount of $186,774.96 by reason of defective works and
                overpayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 8 September 2014, the defendant
                    notified the plaintiff of its intention to apply for adjudication. On
                    9 September 2014, the defendant lodged an adjudication application in
                    respect of the Payment Claim with the Singapore Mediation Centre (“the
                    SMC”). An adjudicator (“the Adjudicator”) was appointed by
                    SMC on 11 September 2014. On 8 October 2014, the AD was
                    rendered in favour of the defendant. Dissatisfied, the plaintiff filed the
                    present application to set aside the AD on the ground that the adjudication
                    application had been filed prematurely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The adjudication proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In order to make sense of the issues raised by
                    the parties, I first set out the statutory timeline for the adjudication
                    process. Sections 11 and 12 of the SOP Act state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) by the date as specified in or
                            determined in accordance with the terms of the construction contract, or

                            whichever is the earlier; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>b</em>) where the construction contract does
                            not contain such provision, within 7 days after the payment claim is
                            served under section 10.</p>

                        application under section 13 in relation to the relevant payment
                        claim.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the claimant is entitled to make an adjudication application under section

                        provide the payment response, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) In this section, “dispute settlement period”, in

                        be provided under section 11(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Adjudication applications</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13. — (1) A claimant who is entitled to make an adjudication
                        application under section 12 may, subject to this section, apply for the

                        application with an authorised nominating body.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) An adjudication application —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) shall be made within 7 days after the
                        entitlement of the claimant to make an adjudication application first arises
                        under section 12;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The key feature of the provisions set out
                    above is that the recipient of a payment claim is to provide a payment response
                    within the period stipulated in the contract, except that if this is more than
                    21 days, the time is limited to 21 days (s 11(1)(<em>a</em>)). In the absence of such a stipulation in the contract, the
                    payment response must be provided within seven days of the service of payment
                    claim (s 11(1)(<em>b</em>)). Thereafter, regardless
                    whether a payment response has been provided, the claimant has to wait out a
                    mandatory seven-day dispute settlement period which commences after the
                    “date on which or the period within which” the payment response is
                    required to be provided (s 12(5)). The entitlement to lodge an adjudication
                    application only begins after the expiry of the dispute settlement period
                    (s 12(2)) and <em>lasts for seven days</em>
                        (s 13(3)(<em>a</em>)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff had originally objected to the
                    adjudication application on two grounds. <em>First</em>,
                    the plaintiff argued that the adjudication application was premature as it was
                    made before the expiry of the dispute settlement period. <em>Secondly</em>, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant did not
                    include a complete set of the payment response in the adjudication application.
                    However at the hearing before me, the plaintiff abandoned the second ground and
                    proceeded only with the first. I shall therefore only address the first
                    ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I have summarised the statutory timelines at
                    [11] above. The plaintiff argued that, should the Variation Agreement be found
                    to be effective, the Payment Response was due two weeks after the submission of
                    the Payment Claim. Accordingly, as the Payment Claim was submitted on
                    19 August 2014, the Payment Response was only due on
                    2 September 2014. This would mean that the 7-day dispute settlement
                    period ran from 3 September 2014 to 9 September 2014, and
                    the defendant’s entitlement to lodge an adjudication application only
                    arose on 10 September 2014. Since the adjudication application was
                    lodged before that, on 9 September 2014, it was
                premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff contended that, even if the
                    Variation Agreement was found to be invalid and therefore not applicable, the
                    adjudication application was also premature. This was because the Payment
                    Response was due 21 days after the submission of the Payment Claim <em>ie</em>, by 9 September 2014. The dispute
                    settlement period would run from 10 September 2014 to
                    16 September 2014, and the defendant’s entitlement to lodge an
                    adjudication application arose on 17 September 2014, eight days after
                    the date on which the adjudication application was actually lodged on
                    9 September 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In essence, the plaintiff took the position
                    that the earliest date on which the defendant’s entitlement to lodge an
                    adjudication application was 10 September 2014. Since the defendant
                    lodged the adjudication application with the SMC on 9 September 2014
                    (the day before its entitlement arose), the plaintiff submitted that the
                    adjudication application was brought prematurely and that consequently, the
                    resulting AD was null and void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The defendant’s position was that the
                    adjudication application was lodged within the statutory timeframe. This was
                    based on two grounds. The first was that the terms of both the Variation
                    Agreement and the Contract (collectively termed “the Agreements”)
                    did not specify or determine the timelines for payment claims and responses.
                    This was because they did not expressly refer to payment claims and responses.
                    Therefore, in the absence of any contractual provision, the default period of
                    seven days applied. Accordingly, the plaintiff was required to furnish its
                    Payment Response by 26 August 2014 and the dispute settlement period
                    ran from 27 August 2014 to 2 September 2014. The
                    defendant’s entitlement to lodge an adjudication application thus arose on
                    3 September 2014 and continued till 9 September 2014, the
                    day on which the adjudication application was actually lodged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant’s second ground was that
                    the dispute settlement period began after the date on which the Payment Response
                    was actually provided and not the date on which it was due. Therefore, although
                    the Payment Response was only due on 2 September 2014, the Payment
                    Response was actually issued earlier, on 27 August 2014. Accordingly,
                    the dispute settlement period begun on 28 August 2014 and ended on
                    4 September 2014. Accordingly, the defendant’s entitlement to
                    lodge the adjudication application arose on
                5 September 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The adjudicator’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Adjudicator determined that the
                    adjudication application was validly lodged within the statutory timeframe. He
                    concluded that the timelines provided by the Agreements applied to payment
                    claims and responses within the meaning of the SOP Act. However, he found that
                    the dispute settlement period started to run from the date of actual service of
                    the Payment Response as opposed to the date by which it was required to be
                    served. This meant that the defendant’s application on
                    9 September 2014 was not premature since its statutory entitlement to
                    lodge an adjudication application began as early as 5 September 2014
                    and only ended on 11 September 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The only point of contention in this
                    application was whether the adjudication application had been lodged
                    prematurely. This turned on two issues. <em>First</em>,
                    whether the timelines stipulated in the Agreements applied to payment claims and
                    responses under the SOP Act. <em>Second</em>, whether the
                    dispute settlement period started to run from the date the payment response was
                    actually served or the date the payment response was required to be
                    served.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The parties in the present application
                    proceeded on the basis that a premature adjudication application would
                    necessarily lead to the invalidation of the resulting AD. Nonetheless, I would
                    like to make the following observations on the consequences of filing an
                    adjudication application outside the timeframe prescribed by
                        s 13(3)(<em>a</em>) of the SOP Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Lee Wee Lick Terence
                        (alias Li Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt

                        (“<em>Chua Say Eng</em>”) at [61], the
                    Court of Appeal left open the question of whether s 13(3)(<em>a</em>) of SOP Act operated as a mandatory condition so that
                    an adjudication application filed out of time is necessarily invalid. However,
                    subsequent decisions have answered the question in the
                affirmative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In <em>Shin Khai Construction

                        (“<em>Shin Khai Construction</em>”), the
                    assistant registrar (“AR”) held that s 13(3)(<em>a</em>) of SOP Act constituted a mandatory condition under
                    the Act and that consequently, an adjudication determination may be set aside if
                    there has been a breach of s 13(3)(<em>a</em>),
                    however slight the breach. The AR stated (at [27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… If s 13(3)(<em>a</em>) was directory
                        and not mandatory, an intolerable uncertainty which would considerably
                        compromise the regime under the Act would be introduced. The adjudicator
                        would be called upon to decide when an application is late but forgivable so
                        as to accept the adjudication application, and late and unforgivable so as
                        to reject it. In the continuum of time, apart from the extreme cases, there
                        would be little predictability and considerable uncertainty as to where such
                        a distinction will lie. <em>In contrast, if s 13(3)(a)
                            was mandatory, the certainty introduced by the bright line test in s
                            13(3)(a) which excludes any adjudication application outside of the
                            seven day window period leaves no room for doubt and is more consistent
                            with and emblematic of the regime</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    The timelines under
                            the SOP Act are therefore very tight so as to facilitate “cash
                            flow by establishing a fast and low cost adjudication system”:
                                <em>W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte

                                Steel</em>”) at [25]. The importance of observing such
                            tight timelines was elaborate [<em>sic</em>] by
                            McDougall J in the Australian decision of <em>Chase
                                Oyster Bar v Hamo Industries</em> [2010] NSWCA 190

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">208 Further, the <em>Security of Payment Act</em>
                            operates in a way that has been described as “rough and
                            ready” or, less kindly, as “Draconian”. It imposes
                            a mandatory regime regardless of the parties’ contract: s 34. It
                            provides extremely abbreviated time frames for the exchange of payment
                            claims, payment schedules, adjudication applications and adjudication
                            responses. It provides a very limited time for adjudicators to make
                            their decisions on what, experience shows, are often extremely complex
                            claims involving very substantial volumes of documents (see, for
                            example, my decision in <em>Laing O’Rourke
                                Australia Construction v H&amp;M Engineering and
                                Construction</em> [2010] NSWSC 818 at [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">209 The <em>Security of Payment Act</em> gives
                            very valuable, and commercially important, advantages to builders and
                            subcontractors. At each stage of the regime for enforcement of the
                            statutory right to progress payments, the <em>Security of
                                Payment Act</em> lays down clear specifications of time and
                            other requirements to be observed. It is not difficult to understand
                            that the availability of those rights should depend on strict observance
                            of the statutory requirements that are involved in their
                            creation.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In my view, the reasoning in <em>Shin Khai Construction</em> and <em>YTL
                        Construction</em> applied with equal force to the situation where an
                    adjudication application was filed prematurely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Furthermore, I should add that the dispute
                    settlement period was designed so as to provide parties with a final opportunity
                    to settle the dispute before triggering the adjudication process (<em>Security of Payments and Construction Adjudication</em> (Chow
                    Kok Fong, 2nd Ed, LexisNexis, 2013) (“SOPCA”) at para 8.4). To
                    help crystallise the issues in dispute and encourage settlement between the
                    parties, both parties are allowed to seek additional information or
                    clarification of the payment dispute (s 12(4)(<em>a</em>) of the SOP Act). Additionally, the respondent is given the
                    right to furnish a payment response where he has failed to do so or vary the
                    payment response that he had furnished earlier (s 12(4)(<em>b</em>) of the SOP Act). The legislative intent of encouraging
                    settlement would be undermined if parties were allowed to “jump the
                    gun” during the dispute settlement period. Therefore, I was satisfied
                    that a premature adjudication application went towards the jurisdiction of the
                    adjudicator, and nullified any resulting adjudication
                determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the timelines in the Agreements applied to payment claims and
                responses under the SOP Act</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ positions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiff submitted that the timelines
                    stipulated in the Agreements applied to payment responses under the SOP Act
                    (“statutory payment responses”). To that end, the plaintiff relied
                    primarily on s 2 of the SOP Act which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“payment claim” means a claim made by a claimant for a
                        progress payment under section 10;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“payment response” , in relation to a construction contract,
                        means a response to a payment claim made by a respondent under section 11(1)
                        or 12(4); …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     According to the plaintiff, the
                    “request for payment” in cl 14(1) of the Contract constituted
                    a claim for a progress payment within the statutory meaning of a payment claim.
                    Since the “interim certificate” in cl 14 was a response to
                    such a claim, it fell within the statutory meaning of a “payment
                    response”. Although the period provided in cl 14 is, in effect, 25
                    days, and this exceeds the limit of 21 days in s 11(1)(<em>a</em>) of SOP Act, this merely operated to bring to effect the
                    statutory limit of 21 days in that provision. Therefore the period for providing
                    the Payment Response in the Contract would be 21 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On the other hand, the defendant argued that
                    the Agreements did not cover statutory payment responses and consequently, the
                    default statutory timeline of seven days applied. First, the defendant contended
                    that the language used in the Agreements (“request for payment”
                    and “interim certificate”) was distinct from the language used in
                    the SOP Act (“payment claim” and “payment response”)
                    and that for reasons of certainty, such clauses ought not to be construed as
                    prescribing the timelines for statutory payment responses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the alternative, the defendant argued that,
                    as a matter of construction, that cl 14 did not refer to a statutory
                    payment response. <em>First</em>, the defendant contended
                    that cl 14 provided the plaintiff with up to 25 days to issue an interim
                    certificate, which is more than the maximum 21 days allowed under the SOP Act.
                        <em>Secondly</em>, the defendant claimed that the
                    progress claims and interim certificates that were issued during the Project did
                    not comply with the provisions of the SOP Act because, for example, the interim
                    certificates did not set out the reasons for the certified amounts even though
                    such reasons are required to be included in a statutory payment response.
                        <em>Lastly</em>, the defendant highlighted the fact
                    that the numbering of the payment claims and responses which were the subject of
                    the adjudication began from one and did not follow the numbering of the progress
                    claims and interim certificates that were previously issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The SOP Act establishes a speedy and low cost
                    dispute resolution mechanism to facilitate the cash flow of contractors
                    operating in the building industry. Under the SOP Act, a party who carries out
                    any construction work or supplies any goods or services under a construction
                    contract is entitled to progress payments (s 5). While that statutory
                    entitlement to payment is founded on the underlying contract, it is separate and
                    distinct from a party’s contractual entitlement to be paid. The result is
                    a “dual railroad track system” consisting of the statutory regime
                    under the [SOP Act] which operates concurrently with, but is quite distinct
                    from, the contractual regime (<em>TransGrid v Siemens and
                        anor</em> [2004] NSWSC 87 at [56]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In practical terms, the dual track regime
                    allows a claimant to make separate claims under the contract and the SOP Act,
                    or, make a claim that has both contractual and statutory force. Likewise, a
                    respondent may provide separate responses under the contract and the SOP Act,
                    or, issue a response that has both contractual and statutory force. At paras
                    9.30, 9.32 and 9.33 in SOPCA, the learned author observed that each of the two
                    major standard forms – the Singapore Institute of Architects
                    (“SIA”) Standard Form and the Public Sector Standard Conditions of
                    Contract (“PSSCOC”) – had taken different approaches:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he arrangement under the SIA Standard Form consists of firstly
                        a provision under clause 31(3) for the architect to issue an interim
                        certificate within 14 days of the receipt of the payment claim, and
                        secondly, a separate provision under clause 31(15(a) for the employer to
                        issue a payment response within 21 days of the receipt of the payment claim.
                            <em>The separation between an interim certificate for
                            progress payment issued by the architect and a payment response issued
                            by the employer is maintained throughout the entire process and there is
                            no intersection in terms of their operation</em>. Consequently, a
                        respondent cannot answer an adjudication application under section 12(2)(b)
                        on the basis that his architect has issued an interim payment certificate if
                        he has not also issued a payment response.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The position in the SIA Standard Form may be contrasted with the approach
                        taken in the PSSCOC. … In essence, the superintending officer has to
                        issue a payment certificate within 14 days from the receipt of the
                        contractor’s payment claim showing the response amount which is the
                        sum computed after taking into account set-offs or counterclaims. <em>Up to this point, the payment certificate has only contractual
                            force</em>. Specifically it does not constitute a payment response
                        for the purpose of the Act notwithstanding the stipulation in the clause
                        that it shall comply fully with the requirements for a payment response
                        under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The transformation of the payment certificate into a payment response is
                        provided under clause 32.2(2). … The payment certificate as issued by
                        the superintending officer is turned into a payment response for the purpose
                        of the Act only if the employer fails to or elects not to provide any
                        response within the 14-day period. The payment certificate is then deemed to
                        be the payment response. <em>At this point, the same document
                            has both contractual and statutory force</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The SIA Standard Form made a clear distinction
                    between an interim certificate and a statutory payment response, and stipulated
                    timelines that applied to each. The interim certificate and statutory payment
                    response were respectively due 14 days and 21 days after the submission of a
                    payment claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In contrast, the PSSCOC envisaged a possible
                    intersection between a payment certificate and a statutory payment response.
                    Under the PSSCOC, a payment certificate was due 14 days after the submission of
                    a payment claim. Thereafter, the same payment certificate would be deemed a
                    statutory payment response where the employer failed to or elected not to
                    provide a further response within the same 14-day period. Thus, a statutory
                    payment response would be provided (or come into existence) within 14 days after
                    the submission of a payment claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Although these standard forms have managed the
                    dual track characteristics of the payment regime differently, what is common
                    between them is that the relationship between the contract and the statutory
                    regime is clearly spelt out. The difficulty in the present case arose due to the
                    failure in the Contract to spell out the relationship between the contractual
                    and statutory tracks. The Contract referred to a “request for
                    payment” and an “interim certificate”, omitting any
                    reference to the statutory language. The pertinent question was <em>whether the parties had intended the timeline provided in cl 14 of
                        the contract to supplant the default timeline in the SOP
                    Act</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     A similar issue was examined in <em>Shin Khai Construction</em> at [30]. The disputed clause read
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Sub-contractor shall submit interim progress claim base on work done
                        upto [<em>sic</em>] the date of claiming on every
                            <b>25<sup>th</sup> of the
                            month</b>. The Contractor shall within 10 days after receipt of
                        the Sub-Contractor’s claim, evaluate and issue a
                        Sub-Contractor’s Payment Certificate certifying the amount of work
                        done, such sums as may be properly due and payable, less the <b>retention money of 10%</b> upto [<em>sic</em>] a maximum of 5% of the contract sum. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The AR held that the dispute turned on a
                    construction of the contractual terms to determine whether the parties had
                    intended for the payment certificate to function as a statutory payment
                    response. Following that, he found that the disputed clause had envisaged a
                    payment certificate which was also to function as a payment response. Instead of
                    providing for certification by an architect or engineer as is usually the case,
                    payment certification was done by the contractor. Furthermore, in certifying the
                    sums “as may be properly due and payable”, the clause contemplated
                    the inclusion of, <em>inter alia</em>, set-offs and
                    cross-claims. For the above reasons, it was held that the contractual timeline
                    had supplanted the default statutory timeline in s 11(<em>b</em>) of the SOP Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the present case, however, for the reasons
                    that follow, I found that the parties had envisaged the contractual and
                    statutory tracks to operate separately, <em>ie</em>, that
                    the contractual timeline did not apply to supplant the default statutory
                    timeline.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     
          <em>First</em>, there
                    were notable linguistic variations between cl 14 of the Contract and the
                    SOP Act. The former used the terms “request for payment” and
                    “interim certificate” whereas the latter used the terms
                    “payment claim” and “payment
                response”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It is a cardinal rule of contractual
                    interpretation that the court must give effect to the intention of the parties
                    as expressed, that is, the meaning of the words actually used (<em>The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Raphael and others</em>
                    [1935] AC 96 at 142 (“<em>Raphael</em>”)).
                    Otherwise, all certainty would be taken from the words in which the parties have
                    recorded their agreement (<em>Raphael</em> at 143).
                    Nevertheless, as observed by Lord Hoffmann in <em>Mannai
                        Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</em> [1997] AC
                    749 at 775, the exercise is not limited to the meaning of the words as they
                    appear in the dictionary, but also extends to the relevant background against
                    which the words were used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the present case, it was unlikely that the
                    reference to an “interim certificate” imported with it a reference
                    to a statutory payment response. In the context of the building industry, a
                    payment certificate (or interim certificate) is often understood to have a
                    complexion slightly different from that of a statutory payment response. Interim
                    certificates are usually independent valuations of work done that are issued by
                    architects or engineers; persons separate from the owner or the principal (SOPCA
                    at para 6.32). On the other hand, a statutory payment response serves to state
                    the respondent’s position in relation to a statutory payment claim and has
                    to satisfy the requirements of the SOP Act (see s 11(3)). This distinction
                    was alluded to in the following passage from SOPCA at para 6.43:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, in the consultative documents on the Bill circulated by the
                        Singapore Building and Construction Authority for comments by the industry,
                        the terms ‘payment certificate’ and ‘payment
                        response’ were used interchangeably. However, the draftsman chose to
                        use the term ‘payment response’ as a specific description of a
                        response to a payment claim and this appears to stem from the consideration
                        that the position taken in the payment certificate may not always be
                        synonymous with that which the owner would adopt in the payment response.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     
          <em>Second</em>, beyond
                    the linguistic variations, the Contract did not appear to pay heed to the
                    statutory requirements of payment claims and responses. To illustrate,
                    cl 14(1) required the “request for payment” to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [Show] the estimated value of the Sub-Contract Works executed up
                        to the end of that month unless in the opinion of the Sub-Contractor such
                        values and amounts together will not justify the issue of an Interim
                        Certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     This may be contrasted with the statutory
                    requirements of a payment claim which are set out in s 10(3) of the SOP
                    Act, and further particularised in reg 5(2) of the Building and
                    Construction Industry Security of Payment Regulations 2005 (“the SOP
                    Regulations”). Section 10(3) of the SOP Act reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Regulation 5(2) reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It was evident that the requirements of a
                    “request for payment” were far less comprehensive than the
                    statutory requirements of a payment claim. In the same vein, it was also
                    apparent that requirements of an “interim certificate” was
                    similarly lacking in view of the statutory requirements of payment responses.
                    Under cl 14(3), an “interim certificate” was required
                    to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [S]how the amounts which have been accepted for payment by the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Adjudicator took the view that the
                    contractual timeline applied to both interim certificates and statutory payment
                    responses because “[f]rom contract clause 14-(3) and s11-(3), there is
                    similarity in characteristic of the content to be taken within the meaning of
                    the Act s11-(1)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> I did not agree. It was obvious from a
                    perusal of the statutory requirements that a “request for payment”
                    and an “interim certificate” that complies with the Contract would
                    not pass muster under the SOP Act. For instance, s 11(3)(<em>c</em>) of SOP Act requires the respondent to state its reason for
                    withholding payment in its payment response. This is one of the most critical
                    elements of the statutory payment response, but the Contract did not require it.
                    I also noted that the interim certificates that were issued pursuant to the
                    Contract did not include reasons for withholding payment,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> but the statutory payment response
                        did.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Payment claims and responses that fail to
                    comply with the statutory requirements risk invalidation and the serious
                    consequences that follow such invalidation. If the parties had intended to rely
                    on the “request for payment” and “interim
                    certificate” to trigger the adjudication process, the relevant terms in
                    the Contract would have presumably incorporated the salient elements of
                    statutory payment claims and responses. Those elements being absent in the
                    Contract, it would appear that the parties did not intend the “interim
                    certificate” to be coterminous with a statutory payment
                response.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Finally, the parties’ subsequent conduct
                    made it abundantly clear that the parties intended to maintain a distinction
                    between the contractual and statutory certification machinery. Although I was
                    mindful of the legal difficulties with the use of subsequent conduct to aid the
                    construction of a contract, I took the view that this was an appropriate case in
                    which recourse may be made to such conduct.</p>

                        recent judicial attention. The last major English decision was in 1973,
                        where the House of Lords firmly closed the door on this category of evidence
                        in <em>L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales
                            Ltd</em> (“<em>Schuler</em>”).
                        How much of <em>Schuler</em> can continue to co-exist
                        with the more liberal attitude evinced in the <em>ICS</em> restatement remains to be seen. In any case, the
                        arguments for and against admitting extrinsic evidence generally are equally
                        applicable to subsequent conduct, and only a few things need be said with
                        regard to this category of evidence. <em>Legally</em>,
                        the meaning of the contract is, of course, fully and finally established at
                        the time of the contract, and not subsequently. <em>Evidentially</em>, however, the considerations which drove the
                        parties to enter into a contract do not evaporate when the contract is
                        concluded, and so long as the parties remain animated by those
                        considerations, their conduct can be valuable evidence of what they meant
                        when they concluded the contract, and, once again there is no reason in
                        principle why the court should be prevented from considering probative
                        evidence in its search for the true agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The courts ought to embrace a consistently commonsensical
                        approach in relation to the admissibility of evidence in contractual
                        disputes. All relevant material which assists in revealing the parties
                        objective intentions should be considered. It can be forcefully said that it
                        is the legal entitlement of the parties to have their objective intentions
                        and the “gold of a genuine consensus”. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The above position was adopted in <em>Leong Hin Chuee v Citra Group Pte Ltd and others</em> [2015]
                    2 SLR 603 at [91] where Tan Siong Thye J held that the subsequent conduct of
                    parties could be considered to determine their common intentions if such conduct
                    was evidentially probative. Thus, I was satisfied that in appropriate cases,
                    evidence of subsequent conduct could be admitted to discern the objective
                    intention of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It was clear from the parties’ conduct
                    that they intended to treat the “interim certificate” as a
                    creature distinct from the statutory payment response. Notably, the parties had
                    restarted the numbering for the payment claim and response that were the subject
                    of the adjudication proceedings. The payment claim and payment response that
                    were the subject of the adjudication proceedings were titled Payment Claim No 1
                    and Payment Response No 1 respectively, although numerous requests for payment
                    and interim certificates had been issued previously. Therefore, I held that the
                    reference to “Interim Certificate” in cl 14 of the Contract
                    did not extend to statutory payment responses and as such, the timelines
                    prescribed therein did not apply to statutory payment responses. Accordingly,
                    the default statutory timeline of seven days applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I should add that while one does not need to
                    go to the extent of expressly stating an intention to supplant the default
                    statutory timeline for such an intention to be effective, that intention would
                    be made unassailable if there was an express provision to that effect. Thus, it
                    would be good practice and prudent for parties who wish to supplant the SOP Act
                    timelines to expressly spell out their intention for “[p]arties that do
                    not take care to properly incorporate their intentions in their contracts have
                    to accept the vagaries of litigation” (<em>Jia Min
                        Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2004] 3 SLR(R) 288 at [31]). It is particularly important in the
                    regime under the SOP Act, in which timelines are not only tight, but also
                    attract drastic consequences. Hence it is essential that contracts clearly
                    express any intention to stipulate the relevant timelines in the SOP Act.
                    Indeed, the courts would not hesitate, in the appropriate case, to interpret
                        <em>contra proferentem</em>, any ambiguity in the
                    drafting, as this would promote the desired behaviour among participants in the
                    industry players.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the dispute settlement period started to run from the date of
                actual service or the date by which the payment response was required to be
                served</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The crux of the defendant’s case was
                    that the dispute settlement period started to run from the date on which the
                    payment response was served. The defendant cited observations to this effect by
                    the assistant registrar (“AR”) in <em>LH Aluminium
                        Industries Pte Ltd v Newcon Builders Pte Ltd</em> [2014] SGHCR 10
                        (“<em>LH Aluminium</em>”) which stated,
                    at [14] – [15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>Where a payment response is in fact served at an earlier
                            date, there is nothing in cl 14.4(c) or 14.5 of the SIA Sub-Contract or
                            cl 10.3 of the Contract that suggests that the “dispute
                            settlement period” should only run from the date at which the
                            payment response was contractually due.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This would also be commercially sensible as otherwise any adjudication, if
                        required, would be delayed without good reason. As both parties have already
                        made clear their positions to each other via a payment claim and payment
                        response, <em>there is no prejudice to the parties if the
                            “dispute settlement period” commences from the actual
                            making of a payment response</em>. Such a reading would further be
                        consistent with the purpose of the [SOP Act] to provide a speedy and
                        effective dispute resolution process for the building and construction
                        industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Relying on the above observations, the
                    defendant submitted that the dispute settlement period began from the service of
                    the Payment Response which was 27 August 2014 and ended after a period
                    of seven days, on 3 September 2014. Thus, the claimant was entitled to
                    make its adjudication application between 4 and 10 September 2014.
                    Accordingly, the adjudication application, which had been filed on
                    8 September 2014, was not premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiff argued otherwise, taking the
                    position that <em>LH Aluminium</em> did not stand for the
                    proposition canvassed by the defendant. In its view, the AR there was not
                    concerned with the meaning and effect of s 12(5) of the SOP Act. Instead,
                    the issue was whether the early submission of a payment claim set the 21-day
                    period for a payment response in motion. The AR there held that where a payment
                    claim had been filed earlier than was required, the payment response need not be
                    submitted until the time contemplated by the contract. It was in this context
                    that this observation was made, <em>ie</em>, that if the
                    payment response was served earlier, there was nothing in the contract
                    preventing the dispute settlement period from commencing after the payment
                    response was served.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     To support its proposition that the dispute
                    settlement period only commenced after the date on which the payment response
                    was due, the plaintiff also cited my judgment in <em>LH Aluminium
                        Industries Pte Ltd v Newcon Builders Pte Ltd</em> [2015] 1 SLR 648 in
                    which the issue was addressed obliquely at [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The dispute settlement period is the period of seven days after the date
                        which the payment response is required to be provided under s 11(1) of the
                        Act. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In my view, the dispute settlement period was
                    only set in motion after the due date of the payment response. I was unable to
                    agree with the AR’s conclusion in <em>LH
                        Aluminium</em> for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     
          <em>First</em>, I
                    disagreed with the suggestion that the dispute settlement period could commence
                    after the payment response was served because nothing in the contract prevented
                    it. The dispute settlement period is a creature of statute and there is no
                    provision for it to be modified by contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     
          <em>Second</em>, I could
                    not see how it is possible to read s 12(5) of the SOP Act as meaning
                    anything else. The provision reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this section, “dispute settlement period”, in relation to
                        a payment claim dispute, means the period of 7 days after the date on which
                        or the period within which the payment response is required to be provided
                        under section 11(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>To facilitate understanding, I have reformatted the provision in
                    the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this section, “dispute settlement period”,
                        in relation to a payment claim dispute, means the period of 7 days
                        after:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the date on which; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the period within which</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the payment response <b>is required to be
                            provided</b> under section 11(1). [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The key words are emphasised above. Both limbs
                    (a) and (b) relate to the date on which, or period within which, the payment
                    response is required to be served, not the date on which the payment response
                    was actually served. To have the meaning contended by the defendant,
                    s 12(5) would have to be drafted along the following lines:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this section, “dispute settlement period”, in relation to
                        a payment claim dispute, means the period of 7 days after the date on which
                            <b><em>the payment response was served</em></b> or the
                        period within which the payment response is required to be provided under
                        section 11(1), <b><em>whichever is the earlier</em></b>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I should add that this interpretation is
                    supported by the following passage in SOPCA at para 8.3, where the learned
                    author stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 12(5) provides that the duration of the dispute settlement period
                        is seven days. This runs from the last day on which the payment response is
                        required to be served by the respondent. It will be noted that there is no
                        requirement for the claimant to notify the respondent of the commencement of
                        the dispute settlement period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Although an argument may be made that the
                    dispute settlement period should commence earlier (<em>ie</em>, after the service of a payment response) since the objective
                    of the SOP Act was to provide a speedy and effective dispute resolution
                    mechanism, this could introduce other problems. One of these would be that the
                    date of service of the payment response may itself be in dispute and this would
                    further delay the process. Therefore reducing the number of facts that may be in
                    dispute would promote greater certainty and further the objective of the SOP Act
                    of facilitating cash flow in the construction industry. The importance of such
                    certainty was explained in <em>Chase Oyster Bar Pty Ltd v Hamo
                        Industries Pty Ltd</em> [2010] NSWCA 190 in which Spigelman CJ
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    This detailed series of time provisions is
                            carefully calibrated to ensure expeditious resolution of any dispute
                            with respect to payments in the building industry. The time limits are a
                            critical aspect of the scheme’s purpose to ensure prompt
                            resolution of disputes about payment. <em>It is
                                commercially important that each party knows precisely where they
                                stand at any point of time. Such certainty is of considerable
                                commercial value</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For the reasons set out above, I found that
                    the Agreements did not apply to supplant the default statutory timeline in
                    s 11(1) of the SOP Act and consequently, that the payment response was due
                    by 26 August 2014. The dispute settlement period commenced on
                    27 August 2014 and ended on 2 September 2014. The claimant
                    was thus entitled to file an adjudication application between
                    3 September 2014 and 9 September 2014. Since the application
                    was in fact filed on 9 September 2014, it was not
                premature.</p>
