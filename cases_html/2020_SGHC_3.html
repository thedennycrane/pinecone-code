</div> the respondent led a team of lawyers at WongPartnership LLP (“WP”) who advised and acted for Mdm A, an octogenarian, in a series of legal proceedings. At the time, after her creation of a trust in late 2010, Mdm A was experiencing difficulties in transferring her assets out of two bank accounts because various family members had expressed concerns to her bankers that she could possibly be under the undue influence of her daughter and son-in-law. In view of the contents of the letters sent to these bankers, Mdm A was concerned that these family members might commence litigation. As anticipated, on 18 February 2011, two of Mdm A’s sisters (“the Sisters”) commenced Originating Summons (Family) No 71 of 2011 (“OSF 71/2011”). OSF 71/2011 was an application under s 20 of the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) for a declaration that Mdm A was unable to make decisions regarding her property and affairs, and for a consequential order that deputies be appointed to make all decisions regarding such matters on her behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 OSF 71/2011 was heavily contested by Mdm A’s daughter and son-in-law (as the first and second defendants), as well as Mdm A herself (as the third defendant). The case was heard at first instance by a senior district judge of the Subordinate Courts (as the State Courts were then known). Following a 30-day trial, the senior district judge found that Mdm A lacked decision-making capacity. This decision was reversed on appeal by the High Court. Eventually, OSF 71/2011 culminated in the Court of Appeal’s decision in Civil Appeal No 27 of 2014 , reported as <span class="font-italic">Re BKR </span>[2015] 4 SLR 81 (“<span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span>”). The Court of Appeal allowed the Sisters’ appeal and held that Mdm A lacked capacity. Deputies were also appointed to act on her behalf. The first and second defendants were ordered to pay the costs of all proceedings, taxed on an indemnity basis, which included Mdm A’s solicitor-and-client costs.

Yet, it is also evident that the DT recognised that it was the role of the Law Society to frame and proceed with the appropriate charges arising from the Complaint. Although the DT had stated that it would not “hear the part that …  [is] excessive”, given the informal nature of pre-hearing conferences, this might not have been their eventual position. This is supported by the Law Society’s letter to the Registrar dated 26 February 2018, where it is stated that “the [DT] also explained that it would not interfere with the Law Society’s prerogative to frame the Charges or to proceed with the [initial four charges] as stated”.

In the present case, the AG and the Law Society seek to invoke the court’s supervisory jurisdiction to quash the Determination. They rely on the references to “correctness, legality or propriety” in these two provisions, which are directly referable to the three grounds of judicial review, illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety: see <span class="font-italic">Mohd Sadique bin Ibrahim Marican and another v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Sadique</span>”) at [10]. The respondent does not dispute the applicability of judicial review nor the grounds suggested. He supports the DT’s Determination and contends that none of the grounds are made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I should clarify that the appellate jurisdiction contained within s 97 of the LPA was not invoked by parties and is therefore not the subject of this judgment. <span class="font-italic">Sadique</span> made clear that s 91A of the LPA, introduced by the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2008 (Act 19 of 2008), consolidated the judicial review process with any hearing on merit into one process: see <span class="font-italic">Sa</span><span class="font-italic">dique</span> at [11]. The appellate jurisdiction which existed prior to those amendments (see <span class="font-italic">Chia Shih Ching James v Law Society of Singapore</span> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 209 at [8] and <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Disciplinary Committee</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 886 at [51]) remains. Post-amendment, this reading is reinforced by the near-identical wording of s 97(4) and s 98(8) of the LPA. The Court of Three Judges has appellate jurisdiction and is able to “go into the merits of the findings and determination of the [DT] on the basis of the evidence led”: <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 85 at [34]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of the parties’ positions on review</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The AG’s case is premised on the ground of illegality, in that the DT failed in its legal duty to hear and investigate the Complaint, in particular, the Mental Capacity Issue, which the AG defined as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether [the respondent] should have had concerns about [Mdm A’s] lack of mental capacity when (i) [the respondent]/WP first met her and took instructions, (ii) when she engaged [the respondent]/WP as counsel, (iii) when WP’s invoices were issued to and paid by [Mdm A]; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) what steps (if any) should have been and/or were taken to determine whether [Mdm A] was in a position to agree to (i) the terms of engagement of [the respondent]/WP, (ii) the type and extent of work undertaken, staffing on the matter, and fees charged, by WP, and (iii) the payment of the invoices rendered by WP[.]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The AG asks that the Determination be set aside and a new DT be appointed to hear and investigate the matter afresh. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Law Society associates itself in the main with the AG’s submissions, although the Law Society relies on all three heads of judicial review (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety) to set aside the Determination. Further, the Law Society is also content for the matter to be remitted back to the same DT if the Determination is to be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The respondent, on the other hand, contends that the Complaint did not include the Mental Capacity Issue, and was only concerned with whether there was overcharging.

</div> In any event, the charges that were eventually proceeded against the respondent did not include the Mental Capacity Issue, and the DT was only required to hear and investigate the charges, and not the Complaint. The DT therefore fulfilled its duty to hear and investigate the charges that were placed before it. The Law Society had unilaterally withdrew the charges pertaining to Mdm A’s mental capacity. Consequently, none of the grounds of judicial review are made out. In the event that any grounds are made out, the respondent submits that it would be “unjust” to subject the respondent to another investigation, whether before the same DT or another DT.

</div> Accordingly, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the areas of concern highlighted by the deputies, and WP’s responses, ought to be investigated by a DT. These areas of concern related to mental capacity issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I am therefore satisfied that the Complaint includes mental capacity issues, and this is evident from the text of the Complaint read in context with the correspondence leading to the Complaint. Specifically, the mental capacity issues concern the adequacy of the steps taken by the respondent and WP to ensure that Mdm A was capable of instructing WP and was capable of agreeing to the fees charged by WP: see [45] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the charges addressed the mental capacity issues within the Complaint</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is clear from a reading of the 4th and 5th charges that they do not engage the mental capacity issues, and are only concerned with overcharging <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Since the mental capacity issues were not the subject matter of the 4th and 5th charges, it follows that the DT would not have heard and investigated these issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The respondent, however, contends that the DT was at all times alive to and did investigate the overcharging charges against the factual matrix of Mdm A’s mental capacity issues. In this regard, the respondent pointed to various extracts in the agreed statement of facts, the respondent’s opening statement, and the transcripts to support this contention. It is not necessary for me to address this issue at length, as it is apparent from the face of the Determination that mental capacity issues were not investigated at all. This stemmed in part from the DT’s determination that mental capacity issues were not within the scope of the Complaint, and the Law Society’s decision to withdraw the charges pertaining to Mdm A’s mental capacity and to proceed on the basis that the mental capacity issues were not relevant for the 4th and 5th charges. Mr Lim, who appeared for the Law Society in the proceedings before the DT, candidly accepted that the Law Society’s case was run <span class="font-italic">on the basis that evidence of mental capacity was not relevant</span> <span class="font-italic">to the proceedings before the DT</span>. It follows that the mental capacity issues would not have been investigated by the DT, whether in the context of the overcharging charges or otherwise. This is reflected in the Determination itself, where the DT expressly stated that “[t]he Coram was concerned by the sums claimed and the terms which were agreed to.” There was no mention in this regard to the Court of Appeal’s concern about mental capacity issues: the Determination at [8]. The DT also expressly mentioned that the 1st to 3rd charges, which touched on Mdm A’s mental capacity, “did not relate to the matters of concern which the Coram had directed to be investigated into”: the Determination at [13]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The respondent further contended that the DT did not have to deal with mental capacity issues as the Law Society had not discharged its preliminary burden of showing that there was overcharging. The mental capacity issues were “irrelevant” if “the basic issue of overcharging has not been proved”. This argument misses the point that the Court of Appeal’s concern was as to whether Mdm A had the capacity to instruct the respondent and WP and agree to the fees charged. Whether or not there was overcharging had to be seen against those factual determinations. Indeed, r 17(8) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015) (“PCR 2015”) provides that there is overcharging if a reasonable legal practitioner cannot in good faith charge the fee, disbursements or amount, taking into account, <span class="font-italic">inter alia, </span>the requirements of the client concerned and any other relevant circumstances. The analysis of whether there is overcharging must therefore take into account the mental capacity issues. These are not two distinct issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Determination should be set aside</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Illegality</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The AG relies only on the ground of illegality, as his contention is that the DT’s failure to consider the Mental Capacity Issues meant that it had not discharged its statutory duty to hear and investigate the Complaint.

Illegality “serves the purpose of examining whether the decision-maker has exercised his discretion within the scope of his authority and the inquiry is into whether he has exercised his discretion in good faith according to the statutory purpose for which the power was granted, and whether he has taken into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take account of relevant considerations”: <span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng </span>at [79]–[80]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 <span class="font-italic">The King v The Board of Education </span>[1910] 2 KB 165 (“<span class="font-italic">Rice (Court of Appeal)</span>”) and the decision on appeal, <span class="font-italic">Board of Education v Rice</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1911] AC 179 (“<span class="font-italic">Rice (House of Lords)</span>”) explains such an approach to duties imposed by statute. A useful summary of <span class="font-italic">Rice (Court of Appeal) </span>is found in <span class="font-italic">Tan Tiang Hin Jerry v Singapore Medical Council </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 553 at [21]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the district of Swansea in England there were two categories of schools: “provided” and “non-provided” schools. The local educational authority gave an increase to the salaries paid to teachers in “provided” schools but did not do likewise for the salaries of teachers in “non-provided” schools. A complaint was made by the Oxford Street school, which was a non-provided school, to the Board of Education that the local education authority was acting in breach of the Education Act 1902 by paying different salaries to teachers in provided and non-provided schools. The Board of Education appointed a barrister, Mr J A Hamilton KC, to hold an inquiry into the matter. After hearing the evidence, Mr Hamilton reported that although Oxford Street school had been maintained and kept efficient, this had been done by the funds provided by the managers of the school and that the school could not be kept efficient unless higher salaries than those which the local authority fixed were paid. The Board of Education decided that there had been no failure on the part of the local education authority to fulfil its statutory duty to maintain the school and that it had not been shown that the money provided by the local education authority was inadequate for the purpose of maintaining and keeping efficient the school in question. The complainant applied for a writ of <span class="font-italic">certiorari</span> to quash the Board of Education’s decision and for a <span class="font-italic">mandamus</span>. The Divisional Court held that the local education authority had no power to discriminate between provided and non-provided schools in the matter of the salaries paid to the teachers and they allowed the application on the ground that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">board had not decided the true question submitted to them</span>. The board appealed and the appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the question placed before the board was whether there were any circumstances existing in the school managed by the complainants such as to justify a different treatment from that accorded to provided schools of the same character. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The board did not address this question at all and there was no indication of the board’s view on this matter.</span> The Court of Appeal thus upheld the first instance decision to grant the application, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">holding that the board had acted in a manner that amounted to a non-exercise of the jurisdiction entrusted to it</span>. Cozens-Hardy MR said at 174–175: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Divisional Court held that a writ of certiorari ought to issue on the ground that the <span class="font-italic">question submitted to the Board had not been answered</span>. On this simple ground I am clearly of opinion that the decision of the Divisional Court was correct. The question was formulated in paras 3 and 4 of the letter of 3 February 1908. It was not whether the Oxford Street school was efficient, in the sense of being able to earn a Government grant, but whether there were any circumstances existing in the case of the Oxford Street school such as to justify a different treatment from that accorded to the ‘provided’ schools of the same character. <span class="font-italic">There is nothing in the Board’s decision to indicate that the right to discriminate, about which the whole battle raged, had ever been challenged</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Accordingly, the English Court of Appeal set aside the Board of Education’s (“the Board”) decision on the ground that there was a “non-exercise of the jurisdiction entrusted to it” as the Board had not answered the question that was referred to it. The House of Lords agreed with the Court of Appeal’s decision. The language used by the House of Lords to set aside the Board’s determination was that the Board had failed to fulfil its duty to answer the true question that was referred to it (<span class="font-italic">Rice (House of Lords) </span>at 181). The House of Lords reasoned as follows at 182:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Comparatively recent statutes</span> have extended, if they have not originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or officers of State the <span class="font-italic">duty of deciding or determining questions of various kinds</span>. … if the Court is satisfied either that the Board have not acted judicially in the way I have described, <span class="font-italic">or have not determined the question which they are required by the Act to determine</span>, then there is a remedy by mandamus and certiorari. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57  In substance, the point that both the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords were making was that the Board had not determined the question which they were required to determine statutorily. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I come, then, to the question of the duties imposed by the LPA. The question is whether the DT had indeed failed to fulfil its legal duty and the following sub-issues arise:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the DT’s duty was to investigate the Complaint or the charges?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the DT’s duty was to investigate the Complaint, did it fail in<span class="font-italic"> </span>that duty?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the DT’s duty was to hear and investigate the Complaint or the charges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It is not in dispute that the LPA stipulates that a DT is required to hear and investigate the matter referred to it: s 93(1) of the LPA. The dispute centres on what constitutes the “matter” which must be heard and investigated by the DT: whether this is the Complaint or the charges referred to it. Both the AG and the Law Society take the position that the DT’s duty is to investigate the Complaint, while the respondent’s position is that the DT only has a duty to investigate the charges that are brought by the Law Society. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Seah Pong Tshai</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The AG relies on <span class="font-italic">Re Seah Pong Tshai </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 744 (“<span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai</span>”) to support his contention that the DT’s duty was to investigate the Complaint. <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>concerned show cause proceedings before the Court of Three Judges. There, the disciplinary committee (the former name of the DT) held that there was sufficient gravity for disciplinary action before the Court of Three Judges. The court held that “the determination was not sustainable as there was a fundamental error in the proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee which … vitiated the entire proceedings”. The order made against the respondent to show cause was accordingly discharged: <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>at [1].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai</span>, the complaint made against the respondent was that he was paid a sum of $1,000 by the complainant, but did not perform any service that justified that sum and refused to refund it to the complainant: <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>at [7]. However, the charge preferred against the respondent was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You, Seah Pong Tshai, an advocate and solicitor, are charged that on or about 17 December 1987, having received the sum of $1,000 in cash as part payment of costs from one Ang Beng Kheng, <span class="font-italic">falsely denied the receipt of the said sum of $1,000 </span>and you are thereby guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty s 80(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161). [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The court held that the charge framed by the Law Society was different from the complaint both in form and substance. As the court explained, “[t]he complaint was not that the respondent had falsely denied receipt of the sum of $1,000 but that the respondent had overcharged him and had refused to refund the amount.” That was the “gravamen” of the complaint. Accordingly, “[t]he Law Society was in error in framing such a charge and bringing it before the Disciplinary Committee for hearing and investigation, as the Disciplinary Committee had no jurisdiction over such a matter and to make a determination thereon”: <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>at [9]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The court further explained that under the LPA, the disciplinary committee was appointed by the Chief Justice to “hear and investigate the matter”. Critically, the court noted that the “matter” refers to the “application or complaint that has been received by the Law Society, that has been inquired into and reported upon by the Inquiry Committee and on which the Council has made a determination”: <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>at [10]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai</span> makes clear that the DT has a duty to hear and investigate the complaint. In the case of a complaint made by a lay complainant (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by way of s 85(1) of the LPA), the “complaint” refers to that received by the Law Society, inquired into and reported upon by the Inquiry Committee and on which the Council has made a determination: <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>at [10]. In other words, the complaint is not the original complaint as such, but the complaint as “filtered” by the Inquiry Committee and Council. In this regard, there might be matters in the complaint which do not disclose a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of ethical breach or other misconduct, and therefore not warrant formal investigation and consideration by a DT: <span class="font-italic">Loh Der Ming Andrew v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2018] 3 SLR 837 at [69]. In contrast, for a complaint made by a judicial office holder, the Attorney-General, the Director of Legal Services or the Singapore Institute of Legal Education, pursuant to s 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA, that complaint is referred <span class="font-italic">directly </span>to a DT without the need for the complaint to be inquired by the Inquiry Committee. Since the LPA does not provide a filter mechanism, implicit in the legislative framework is an expectation that the entire complaint is of sufficient gravity to warrant a formal investigation and consideration by the DT, and ought to be placed before the DT.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 At the same time, it is not inconsistent<span class="font-italic"> </span>to suggest that the DT has a duty to investigate <span class="font-italic">both </span>the complaint and the charges, as the charges must encapsulate the gravamen of the complaint. As the AG rightly noted in reply to the respondent, the charges perform a sifting function in relation to complaints by lay complainants. Charges also give shape to the disciplinary proceedings, as the DT does not sit <span class="font-italic">in vacuo </span>but convicts or acquits the respondent on the basis of the charges that are before it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In my judgment, the following propositions emerge from <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>and the case law which I discuss in turn below: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the “matter” that has to be heard and investigated by the DT is the complaint, and in a typical case, it is assumed that the matter would be the complaint as properly framed by the Law Society in the charge.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Put another way, it is assumed that the substance of the complaint will be reflected in the charge, and that constitutes the matter to be heard and investigated. Where the Law Society has erred in framing the charge, then the DT’s determination is liable to be set aside, as it was in <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the DT has a duty to hear and investigate the complaint. The DT also has a duty to hear and investigate the charges. The two duties are not mutually exclusive and in fact are complementary to one another, in that the expectation must be that the charges reflect the gravamen of the complaint and fall within the scope of the complaint.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I find the cases relied on by the respondent to suggest that the DT does not have a duty to investigate the complaint to be consonant instead with the principles I have mentioned above. I turn to these cases to explain.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Manjit Singh </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal </span><span class="font-italic">Singh and another v Attorney-General </span>[2013] 4 SLR 483 (“<span class="font-italic">Manjit Singh</span>”) at [5], raised by the respondent, the Court of Appeal stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Second, the disciplinary process cannot be procedurally and substantively contingent on the subsistence of a complaint. Indeed, it is settled law that a DT, once seised of jurisdiction, will be unaffected by the withdrawal of the <span class="font-italic">initial complaint</span>. The basic rationale for this is that the DT has been appointed to <span class="font-italic">investigate the charges formulated by the Law Society and not the complaints which occasioned those charges</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 308, <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v Rajagopal Shan</span> [1994] SGDSC 2 and <span class="font-italic">Re Shan Rajagopal</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 60). By analogy with criminal prosecutions, the investigation and hearing of disciplinary charges is predicated not on the validity of the complainant’s further thoughts in relation to his complaint, but on the propriety of the subject’s conduct. We would also underscore that the disciplinary process cannot be held hostage to the whims of complainants, who may, in the nature of things, have a multitude of personal reasons for choosing to submit and then withdraw a complaint. The fact that a complaint has been withdrawn does not necessarily mean that there was no truth to the complaint. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 When read in its proper context, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Manjit Singh </span>was not suggesting that the DT has no duty to investigate the complaint. Rather, the context of the passage above was that it concerned a lay complainant withdrawing her complaint. The Court of Appeal was simply pointing out that the mere withdrawal of the “initial complaint” would not affect the jurisdiction of the DT, as the <span class="font-italic">substance </span>of the complaint would continue to subsist in the charges formulated by the Law Society.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Shan Rajagopal</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I turn to the case of <span class="font-italic">Re Shan Rajagopal </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 60 (“<span class="font-italic">Shan Rajagopal</span>”). The respondent points out that in <span class="font-italic">Shan Rajagopal</span>, a case which was decided close to three years after <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai</span>, a similarly constituted coram held that the “matter … refers to the charges formulated by the Law Society and not the original complaint”: <span class="font-italic">Shan Rajagopal </span>at [15]. On one reading, one might say that <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>and <span class="font-italic">Shan Rajagopal </span>are inconsistent insofar as the former suggests that the matter which the DT is required to hear and investigate refers to the complaint while the latter suggests that the matter refers to the charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my view, however, both <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>and <span class="font-italic">Shan Rajagopal </span>ought to be read consistently and it could not be the intent of <span class="font-italic">Shan Rajagopal </span>to alter the principles in <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai</span>. Given that <span class="font-italic">Shan Rajagopal </span>was another case which concerned the withdrawal of a complaint, the Court of Three Judges was simply making the point, as did the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Manjit Singh</span>, that the substance of the <span class="font-italic">complaint</span> continues to subsist in the charges formulated by the Law Society, which the DT is required to hear and investigate. The withdrawal of the “original complaint” does not mean that the DT has no jurisdiction to make a determination. The matter refers to the substance of the complaint as reflected in the charge, and the DT still has a duty to hear and investigate the complaint. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Ravi Madasamy</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v Ravi Madasamy </span>[2006] SGDSC 8 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy (DT)”</span>), the respondent was charged for failing to act with due courtesy to a District Judge by turning his back to the District Judge while being addressed, remaining seated while being addressed, speaking in loud tones to the Prosecuting Officer whilst mention cases were being carried out and responding to the District Judge in an unbecoming manner. Initially, there was a fifth aspect to the charge, which was an allegation that the respondent had threatened the District Judge to report her to the Ministry of Law and the Legal Service Commission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It transpired that there was an agreement between the Law Society and the respondent for the respondent to withdraw his defence, admit to the facts in the amended statement of case and the amended charge, provided that the fifth aspect to the charge was deleted from the charge. The disciplinary committee was of the view that it was placed in a “rather awkward position” as the respondent admitted that he had said to the District Judge that he would report her. Yet, the disciplinary committee was unable to deal with that “most serious misconduct” as it had been deleted from the proceeded charge: <span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy (DT) </span>at [21]. The respondent in the present case relies on the following paragraph from the disciplinary committee’s determination at [22] to assert that the DT only has a duty to hear and investigate the charge and not the complaint:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Law Society is <span class="font-italic">absolutely correct that we cannot go beyond the charge preferred</span><span class="font-italic"> by them against the Respondent</span>. In fact, Mr Sreenivasan, learned counsel for the Respondent, took great pains to impress upon us our limitations … But that did not help us understand the Law Society’s position. It would do well for the Law Society to remind itself that every single disciplinary case they undertake must “showcase” why the legal profession can be entitled to regulate themselves. Sadly, the way these proceedings were handled is not a good example. Something has gone quite wrong. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The respondent argues that it is telling that the disciplinary committee in <span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy (DT) </span>did not seek to direct the Law Society to amend its charge, as it would have if its duty was to hear and investigate the complaint. Further, when the case went before the Court of Three Judges (see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ravi Madasamy </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 300 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy</span>”), the court stated that the disciplinary committee was “entitled to express its misgivings”: <span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy </span>at [51]. This suggests that the court was of the same view as the disciplinary committee, in that it was for the Law Society to frame the charges and that the committee did not have a duty to direct the Law Society to reframe the charges based on the committee’s view of the complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I accept the respondent’s contention that under the principle of self-regulation, it is for the Law Society to frame the charges based on its view of the complaint. It is important to note, however, that <span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy </span>also makes clear at [47] that the Law Society’s “exercise of disciplinary powers”, including the “prosecution of disciplinary charges”, is open to judicial review. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76  In my view, what <span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy </span>stands for is that the Law Society itself has a duty to frame charges that reflect the complaint, and where this is not done, the Law Society’s power is subject to judicial review. This is clear from the following passage in <span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy </span>at [47]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the first issue, the DC accepted that, on the principle of self-regulation, the Law Society had the power to amend the original charge subject to leave being obtained from the DC. That was why the DC allowed the amendments. We agree with the DC that the Law Society was so entitled, but not to the extent that counsel has claimed, <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">viz</span>, in the prosecution of disciplinary charges, the Law Society’s powers are no different from those of the Public Prosecutor in relation to criminal charges. <span class="font-italic">The two powers are not equiparate.</span> The power of the Law Society to “prosecute” advocates and solicitors for disciplinary offences is a statutory power derived from the Act, whereas, in contrast, the prosecutorial power of the Public Prosecutor, in so far as he is also the Attorney-General, is constitutionally based: see s 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) read with Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed). The fundamental difference is vast: the exercise of disciplinary <span class="font-italic">powers by the Law Society is subject to judicial review whilst the exercise of his prosecutorial powers by the Attorney-General </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">qua</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor is not subject to judicial review. </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Pursuant to s 91A of the LPA, that review may be dealt with in the context of a s 97 application. In <span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy</span>, there was no application made to review the Law Society’s decision not to proceed with the fifth allegation in the original charge. But the passage referred in the preceding paragraph suggests that if the Law Society had proceeded with a charge that took away the gravamen of the complaint, or was outside the scope of the complaint, then that exercise of its power could be judicially reviewed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In summary, the cases relied on by the respondent do not in any way show that the DT has no duty to hear and investigate the complaint. Rather, the Law Society has a concomitant duty to frame the charges appropriately, and this is a duty that is consistent with the DT’s duty to hear and investigate the complaint. Both duties may be the subject of review before me. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Exercise of statutory roles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In my view, there are two separate issues in relation to the exercise of statutory duties at hand, and either suffices to set aside the Determination. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the charges brought by the Law Society did not reflect the gravamen of the Complaint. The mental capacity charges were withdrawn and in any event did not reflect accurately the mental capacity issues the Court of Appeal were concerned with. Further, the charges were also based on the wrong PCR and were thus also wholly outside the scope of the Complaint. A failure to fulfil a legal duty amounts to illegality. Since the charges were erroneous, it must follow that the Determination was also erroneous and has to be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, because the charges were defective and did not reflect the substance of the Complaint, the DT lacked jurisdiction in hearing and investigating the 4th and 5th charges and making a determination thereon. In the present case, a second aspect of the DT’s misapprehension of its jurisdiction was that it had made an erroneous determination that mental capacity issues were not within the scope of the Complaint. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The defective charges </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The role of the charges</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I first consider the Law Society’s role in the preferment of the charges in disciplinary proceedings generally. Because of the principle of self-regulation, it is for the Law Society, and not the DT, to determine what charges should be brought against the respondent: <span class="font-italic">Ravi Madasamy </span>at [19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 This is supported by r 3(1) of the Legal Profession (Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules (Cap 161, R 2, 2010 Rev Ed) (“DT Rules”), which states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Commencement of Disciplinary Tribunal proceedings by Society</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span>—(1) Where the Council applies to the Chief Justice under section 89(1) to appoint a Disciplinary Tribunal to hear and investigate a matter against a regulated legal practitioner, the Society shall, within 2 working days after the date the Council makes the application —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">…</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provide the Secretariat with the following information:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (ix) the charge or charges against the regulated legal practitioner;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Section 89(1) of the LPA, with which r 3(1) is concerned, applies where Council has determined under s 87 of the LPA that there should be a formal investigation. While there is no express provision in respect of a referral by a judicial office holder to a DT, such a referral is made pursuant to s 85(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which mandates that Council must apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a DT. The same responsibility to frame charges must therefore exist as part of the process of application to the Chief Justice to appoint a DT. I was informed by the Law Society that in practice, the procedure is the same as that when the DT is appointed pursuant to s 89(1) of the LPA.

</div>
</div> That is to say, Council would apply to the Chief Justice to appoint a DT, and within two working days, provide the charge or charges to the secretariat which provides administrative support to the DT. Neither the AG nor the Law Society contend that the Law Society’s responsibility over the charges would differ depending on whether the complainant was a lay complainant (where s 89(1) of the LPA would apply) or in the case where the complainant was a judicial office holder (where s 85(3) of the LPA would apply).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The withdrawn charges</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It is convenient at this juncture to briefly mention that, the AG took the view, with which I agree, that <span class="font-italic">even if </span>the 1st to 3rd charges were <span class="font-italic">not </span>withdrawn by the Law Society, they would not have in any event fully encompassed the mental capacity issues in the Complaint. In other words, the charges preferred by the Law Society against the respondent were defective from the outset, as they did not fully capture the gravamen of the Complaint. The 1st charge, withdrawn on 16 July 2018, focused on Mdm A’s mental capacity to litigate. The AG pointed out that the Complaint related to her <span class="font-italic">capacity to instruct the respondent and WP and to agree to the fees charged</span>. The 2nd charge, withdrawn on 25 April 2018, was concerned with a breach of r 35 of PCR 2010. Rule 35 stipulates certain information that a solicitor shall inform his client, such as the basis for which fees will be charged and the manner in which those fees and disbursements shall be paid. As regards the 3rd charge, withdrawn on 16 July 2018, the rule that was alleged to have been breached was r 40 of PCR 2010, which provides that a solicitor “shall, in appropriate cases, evaluate with a client whether the consequence of a matter justifies the expense or the risk involved”. These two rules (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, rr 35 and 40 of PCR 2010) do not engage the mental capacity issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Returning to the 1st charge, the Law Society’s position was that it had “little or no reasonable alternative” but to withdraw the charge relating to Mdm A’s mental capacity in the face of the DT’s clearly communicated views. This contention ignores the fact that the DT had stated, on more than one occasion, that it was the Law Society’s prerogative to frame the charges: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the Law Society’s letter to the Registrar dated 26 February 2018, it is stated that “the [DT] also explained that it would not interfere with the Law Society’s prerogative to frame the Charges or to proceed with the [initial four charges] as stated”: see [14].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At the pre-hearing conference on 20 April 2018, the DT made clear that it was the role of the Law Society to prefer the charges and that it was “not obliged” to agree with the DT as to the scope of the Complaint: see [12]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At the pre-hearing conference on 22 May 2018, the DT recognised that pursuant to r 18 of the DT Rules, the DT can permit amendments to the charges but would not initiate such amendments, and it is for the Law Society to frame the charges as it sees fit: see [16].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The point made by the DT, referred to at [84(c)] above, merits closer attention. Rule 18 of the DT Rules states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amendments of or additions to statement of case</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>—(1) If it appears to the Disciplinary Tribunal that the allegations in a statement of the case should be amended or added to, the Disciplinary Tribunal may permit the amendment of or addition to the statement of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) If the amendment or addition is allowed at the Disciplinary Tribunal hearing, and the amendment or addition is such as to take any party by surprise or prejudice the conduct of his case, the Disciplinary Tribunal shall grant an adjournment of the Disciplinary Tribunal hearing as the Disciplinary Tribunal thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) If the Disciplinary Tribunal permits the amendment of or addition to the statement of the case, the Disciplinary Tribunal shall also permit the respondent to amend his defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86  As the DT rightly recognised, the statement of case will also “[specify] the charges and allegations that the regulated legal practitioner is required to answer”: see r 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the DT Rules. The DT’s view was that it could permit amendments to the charges but would not initiate such amendments. This is consonant with the Law Society’s role in r 3(1) to frame the charges and pursue their prosecution as part of its responsibility in self-regulation. In this particular case, the DT had refused leave to amend the charges; however the proposed amendments to the charges merely cut down various mental capacity elements. It was the withdrawal of the charges altogether which took the mental capacity issues out of consideration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The 4th and 5th charges </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I come then to the charges the Law Society proceeded with. It is appropriate at this juncture to deal with whether the 4th and 5th charges were correctly brought under the appropriate version of the PCR. Although the initial charges were based on the PCR 2010, this was later amended to the PCR 2015 by the Law Society. It transpired that the DT had taken the view that the PCR 2015 was applicable. In agreeing to amend the charge, it appears that the Law Society agreed with the DT’s view. Before me, counsel for the Law Society also maintained that the DT was right in maintaining that view, and in that sense, there was a “parting from ways” from the AG and the respondent,

The 4th charge, as originally framed, alleged that the respondent was in breach of r 38 of the PCR 2010, which is the provision on gross overcharging. On 27 February 2018, the DT made the following request to the parties:

</div> This is because the substance of the conduct that was to be heard and investigated by the DT occurred <span class="font-italic">before </span>the PCR 2015 was in force. The relevant fees and bills were charged and rendered by WP to Mdm A <span class="font-italic">before </span>18 November 2015 (when the PCR 2015 came into effect). The only relevant acts after the PCR 2015 came into effect was that the bills were subject to taxation proceedings and a fee agreement was entered into. However it was still the case that the<span class="font-italic"> </span>taxation proceedings and fee agreement were based on fees and bills incurred and rendered before the PCR 2015 was in force. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I note that in taking the erroneous view that the PCR 2015 was applicable (see also [31]–[32] of the GD), the DT was acting consistently with its misplaced view that the Complaint did not concern mental capacity issues. If the DT had appreciated that mental capacity issues were relevant in deciding whether the respondent and WP took sufficient steps to ascertain if Mdm A could instruct them and agree to the fees charged, then it would have been clear that the applicable PCR was the PCR 2010. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Law Society, notwithstanding that it <span class="font-italic">initially </span>agreed with the respondent that the PCR 2010 was applicable, proceeded to rely on the PCR 2015 when it added the 5th charge and amended the 4th charge to change the reference from the PCR 2010 to the PCR 2015. These proceeded charges were defective. First, the charges did not encompass the mental capacity issues, and hence the gravamen of the Complaint referred by the Court of Appeal was not put before the DT. Second, the charges were in any event based on the wrong edition of the PCR, taking them outside the premise of the Complaint. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left"> (2) Lack of jurisdiction</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In the light of the charges proceeded with, <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai </span>is squarely applicable. To recapitulate, in that case, the Court of Three Judges held there that the charge was different from the complaint in both form and substance. The Law Society had erred in the framing of the charge and the DT had “no jurisdiction to hear and investigate anything else other than the complaint”: <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai</span> at [14]. In the present case, the 4th and 5th charges (see [21]) are wholly outside the scope of the Complaint. This is because the Court of Appeal was not concerned with overcharging <span class="font-italic">per se </span>and whether the sums were reasonable for the nature of proceedings and the amount of work done. The true gravamen of the Complaint was as to whether the respondent and WP had taken sufficient steps to ascertain if Mdm A had the capacity to instruct them and to agree to the fees charged. Those were also the concerns highlighted by the deputies. Whether or not there was overcharging, a related aspect of the Complaint, then had to be seen in the context of the findings made on these issues. In addition, the charges were also based on the wrong PCR and that took it outside the scope of the Complaint. Accordingly, as in <span class="font-italic">Seah Pong Tshai</span>, the charges were different from the Complaint both in form and substance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Irrationality</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Given the conclusion that I have reached, I make only brief observations on the submissions regarding irrationality for the sake of completeness. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Seet Eng </span>explained at [80] that irrationality, as a ground of review, seeks to ascertain the range of legally possible answers and asks if the decision made is one which, though falling within that range, is so absurd that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The AG’s position is that irrationality does not arise, because the charges were wholly defective. The Law Society’s position is that the 4th and 5th charges were broad enough to cover mental capacity issues. This is because in determining if there is overcharging (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether a reasonable legal practitioner can in good faith charge the fee, disbursements or amount: see r 17(8) of PCR 2015), the mental capacity of the client must be taken into account. However, this is not the manner in which the Law Society ran its case before the DT, and Mr Lim, its counsel, confirmed that. It was the responsibility of the Law Society to present all the relevant facts before the DT. If the Law Society had done so, and the DT determined that it would not consider any facts relating to Mdm A’s lack of mental capacity, then its Determination would be open to challenge on the ground of irrationality. But Mr Lim, who appeared for the Law Society in the proceedings before the DT, candidly accepted that the Law Society’s case was run <span class="font-italic">on the basis that evidence of mental capacity was not relevant</span> <span class="font-italic">to the proceedings before the DT</span>. In the circumstances, the AG’s position on irrationality is, in my view, more apposite. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Procedural impropriety</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The ground of procedural impropriety refers to a failure by the DT to observe basic rules of natural justice or a failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision. It will also cover a failure by a DT to observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is conferred, even where such failure does not involve any denial of natural justice: <span class="font-italic">GCHQ </span>at 411.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The Law Society relies on the same two points for the ground of procedural impropriety, as that put forward for the ground of illegality. The Law Society’s position is that “a refusal to hear evidence that might lead to a different decision amounts to procedural impropriety”.

</div> Specifically, it was highlighted that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The DT did not consider the fact that Mdm A had been found to lack capacity at the material time in coming to its determination on the propriety of the fees charged;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The DT did not undertake adequate or proper investigation into the facts showing that Mdm A lacked mental capacity at the material time given its determination, during the course of the proceedings, that these matters were not within the scope of the Complaint.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As I have stated in the context of irrationality, it is not tenable to suggest that the DT had refused to hear such evidence when the Law Society did not proffer the evidence.

I do not accept the respondent’s contention that the Determination should be allowed to stand as an investigation on the mental capacity issues will not affect the findings on overcharging. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 A more fundamental question is whether it would be “unjust”, as the respondent submits, for the respondent to be subject to another investigation for the same matter.

</div>
</div>
</div> I accept that the respondent was fully prepared to defend himself against the mental capacity issues. Further, the respondent had also proceeded on the right basis that the applicable PCR was the PCR 2010. The situation is an unfortunate one. That the court is only able to review the errors on the part of the Law Society and the DT after disciplinary proceedings have concluded is a function of Parliament’s intent in introducing s 91A of the LPA in order to speed up the DT process. The framework relies upon the Law Society and the DT dealing with their respective responsibilities as the statute envisages. Section 97(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) envisions that the matter could be reheard and reinvestigated before the same DT or before a new DT, upon a review by a Judge under a s 97 application. Any fresh hearing is consistent with the legislative framework and the public interest that complaints against lawyers are fully heard and investigated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether a new DT should be appointed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I turn then to whether the matter should be remitted to the same DT or to a new DT. The AG’s position is that a new DT should be appointed to hear and investigate the Complaint. In contrast, both the Law Society and the respondent take the view that the matter may be remitted back to the same DT for the Complaint to be heard and investigated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The AG submits that the case of <span class="font-italic">Secretary of State for the Home Department v Raytheon Systems Ltd </span>[2015] Bus LR 626 (“<span class="font-italic">Raytheon</span>”) is pertinent. There, Akenhead J held that there was an irregularity affecting the arbitral tribunal or the award on the basis that the tribunal had failed to deal with two material issues that were raised before it. The tribunal had not applied their minds to the issues and “any right minded party to [the] arbitration would feel that justice had not been served”: <span class="font-italic">The Secretary of State for the Home Department v Raytheon Systems Ltd </span>[2014] EWHC 4375 at [50] and [61]. Akenhead J held that the matter, which was to be remitted, ought to be resolved by a different arbitral tribunal. He reasoned as follows at [23(b)] of <span class="font-italic">Raytheon</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Like Mance J on the <span class="font-italic">Lovell Partnerships (Northern) Ltd</span> case (1996) 81 BLR 83, I can see that it would be "invidious and embarrassing [for the tribunal] to be required to try to free [itself] of all previous ideas and to re-determine the same issues" and that even for a conscientious tribunal seeking to redetermine such issues the exercise could well "create its own undesirable tensions and pressures". Of course, it is not possible to predict what this tribunal would do if matters were remitted to them. If however, albeit conscientiously and competently, the tribunal in effect reached exactly the same conclusions as before, that might well lead to a strong belief objectively that justice had not been or not been seen to have been done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The respondent points out that the DT is already aware of the factual matrix of the present case. He relies on <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel </span>[2010] 3 SLR 390 (“<span class="font-italic">Jasmine Gowrimani</span>”) to contend that the matter should be sent back to the same DT. In that case, the DT had held that it did not possess the discretion to refrain from referring matters to the Court of Three Judges once all the elements of a disciplinary charge had been made out. The Court of Three Judges held otherwise and remitted the matter to the same DT for it to decide on the appropriate punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In <span class="font-italic">Jasmine Gowrimani</span>, the DT had before it all the relevant facts to impose any sanction it thought fit. In fact, the DT in that case had expressly stated that they were prepared to find that there was no cause of sufficient gravity notwithstanding that all the elements of the charge were satisfied. However, the DT was persuaded otherwise by an academic commentary which was of the view that when a charge under s 83(2) of the LPA is made out, a finding of cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action is mandated: <span class="font-italic">The Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel </span>[2009] SGDT 6 at [38]. As the Court of Three Judges clarified, this view was an erroneous one. Remitting the matter back to the same DT would therefore have provided them the opportunity to carry out what they had initially sought to do, which was to find that no cause of sufficient gravity existed and to impose alternative sanctions. In the case at hand, the Law Society would be required to frame wholly fresh charges. Counsel representing the Law Society would be required to conduct the new proceedings on a substantially different footing, with material additional evidence. <span class="font-italic">Jasmine Gowrimani </span>is therefore not on point. In considering the matter afresh, there is no doubt that the same DT would conscientiously do so if the matter is remitted to it again. Nevertheless, <span class="font-italic">Raytheon</span> points out that there could be a wider issue of public perception if the same DT in such circumstances reaches the same conclusion. In the interests of fairness to the respondent, this should be remitted to a fresh DT, who would not be thus constrained. It follows from the same rationale that Council should also appoint fresh counsel to represent the Law Society, who will be required to adduce material evidence pertaining to the mental capacity issues and run the Law Society’s case on that new basis. A second DT, assisted by counsel on both sides, could consider directions appropriate to save costs in the fresh proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applications for extension of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Both the AG and the Law Society filed applications for an extension of time to bring OS 810/2019 and 812/2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">OS 812/2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Under the scheme of the LPA, the findings and determination of the DT under s 93 will first be drawn up in the form of a report and submitted to the Chief Justice and the Law Society: see s 93(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the LPA. Thereafter, s 94(4) of the LPA provides that Council must “inform the regulated legal practitioner and the person who made the complaint” of the determination of the DT within 14 days from the date the Law Society receives a copy of the report. Section 97(1) of the LPA provides that the complainant, respondent or the Council may apply to a Judge for a review of that determination “within 14 days of being notified of that determination”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Pursuant to s 92(1) of the LPA, the reference to a “person who made the complaint” shall be construed as including a reference to the AG. Accordingly, reading ss 94(4) and 97(1) in the light of s 92(1) must mean that Council should inform the AG of the determination of the DT within 14 days from the date the Law Society receives a copy of the report. Further, upon being notified, the AG may apply to a Judge under s 97 of the LPA for a review of the DT’s determination within 14 days of being notified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The respondent contends that the AG acts <span class="font-italic">on behalf</span> of and represents the judicial office holder in s 97 applications. Since his position is tied to that of the complainant (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the judicial office holder), he cannot stand in a different position from the complainant. In the present case, there is no evidence before the court as to when the judicial office holder was notified of the Determination. Therefore, the respondent submits that the inference to be drawn is that OS 812/2019 was brought more than 14 days after the judicial office holder was notified of the Determination.

</div> Section 91A of the LPA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Restriction of judicial review</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">91A.</span>—(1) Except as provided in sections 82A, 97 and 98, there shall be no judicial review in any court of any act done or decision made by the Disciplinary Tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The respondent relies on two English decisions to support his contention: <span class="font-italic">R v Cornwall County Council, ex parte Huntington and another </span>[1992] 3 All ER 566 (“<span class="font-italic">Cornwall</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler </span>[1976] 3 All ER 90 (“<span class="font-italic">Ostler</span>”). The relevant time-limited ouster clauses in both cases are worded similarly. Since <span class="font-italic">Ostler </span>was cited and directly applied in <span class="font-italic">Cornwall</span>, it is convenient to refer to the latter decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In <span class="font-italic">Cornwall</span>, an application was brought to review a public right of way order pursuant to s 53(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (c 69) (UK). The time-limited ouster clause, found in para 12 of Sch 15 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) If any person is aggrieved by an order which has taken effect and desires to question its validity on the ground that it is not within the powers of section 53 … or that any of the requirements of this Schedule have not been complied with in relation to it, <span class="font-italic">he may within 42 days from</span><span class="font-italic"> the date of publication of the notice under paragraph 11 make an application to the High Court under this paragraph.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) On any such application the High Court may, if satisfied that the order is not within those powers or that the interests of the applicant have been substantially prejudiced by a failure to comply with those requirements, quash the order, or any provision of the order, either generally or in so far as it affects the interest of the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) <span class="font-italic">Except as provided by this paragraph, the validity of an order shall not be questioned in any legal proceedings whatsoever.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In coming to the view that para 12 was a time-limited ouster clause, such that leave to seek judicial review was set aside, the English High Court reasoned as follows at 575:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… When paragraphs such as those considered in [<span class="font-italic">Ostler</span>] are used, then the legislative intention is that questions as to invalidity may be raised on the specified grounds in the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner, but that otherwise the jurisdiction of the court is excluded in the interest of certainty. This was the view of Lord Denning MR (with whom Shaw LJ agreed) [in <span class="font-italic">Ostler</span>] and that view is binding on this court. I would, however, have independently formed the same view <span class="font-italic">for the legislative intention seems to </span><span class="font-italic">me to be plain from the language employed when the two sub-paragraphs of para 12 are taken together. </span>… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The question of whether s 91A of the LPA is a time-limited ouster clause is therefore one of statutory interpretation. In my judgment, a plain reading of the text of s 91A read with ss 82A, 97 and 98 of the LPA makes clear that s 91A is <span class="font-italic">not </span>a time-limited ouster clause. As the AG rightly points out, s 91A of the LPA could not be intended by Parliament to be a time-limited ouster clause, simply because ss 82A and s 98, the other two provisions referred to in s 91A, do not contain any time limits at all. There is therefore a material difference between s 91A and the ouster clause in <span class="font-italic">Corn</span><span class="font-italic">wall</span>, where para 12(1) stated that the application for judicial review had to be brought within 42 days and para 12(3) specifically provided that the court’s jurisdiction would be ousted if that condition was not met: see [116] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The common feature of ss 82A (which refers to s 98), 97 and 98 of the LPA is that they concern applications to the court <span class="font-italic">after </span>disciplinary proceedings have concluded where the court is able to exercise supervisory and appellate jurisdiction over the DT: see [24]–[26] above. In my view, the legislative purpose of s 91A is simply to provide that a DT’s findings and determination can only be reviewed <span class="font-italic">after </span>the proceedings are completed, by way of the applicable provision (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ss 82A, 97 or 98). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 This reading of s 91A of the LPA is supported by the parliamentary debates, which make plain that s 91A was introduced, by way of the 2008 amendments to the LPA, to <span class="font-italic">defer </span>judicial review, such that it takes place after disciplinary proceedings have concluded so as to prevent delay. The Minister of Law stated at the Second Reading of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (No 16 of 2008) (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(26 August 2008) vol 84 col 3251) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I would clarify that judicial review is not </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">“ousted”. What we are doing is deferring it</span>, because what has happened in the past is that even before the tribunal proceedings and disciplinary proceedings are over, there were repeated applications for judicial review, which then dragged on and delayed the entire proceedings, vastly contributing to delays. <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">So, the approach has been to finish with the process, then you go for judiciary review</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. </span>… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Woo Bih Li J held similarly in <span class="font-italic">Deepak Sharma v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2016] 4 SLR 192, concluding at [39] that the object of s 91A is to consolidate the judicial review process to the end of the DT process: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Viewed against this background, s 91A is more accurately characterised as <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">restricting</span> or <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">consolidating</span> the then-existing judicial review process over DT decisions to the extent provided under ss 82A, 97 and 98 of the LPA. This is in contrast to the characterisation of the provision by the Law Society as “[providing] judicial review as a form of recourse … for DT proceedings”. Section 91A’s purpose is to speed up the disciplinary process <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at the DT stage</span>. It would be a stretch, on a purposive statutory interpretation, to say that by restricting or consolidating the judicial review process over DT decisions, Parliament intended to completely exclude judicial review over decisions of a review committee which is an entirely different stage of the disciplinary process. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The decision of the Court of Three Judges in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Zulkifli bin Mohd Amin and another matter </span>[2011] 2 SLR 620 (“<span class="font-italic">Zulkifli</span>”) is also relevant. In <span class="font-italic">Zulkifli</span>, the Law Society had failed to comply with s 87(1A) of the LPA as the Inquiry Committee had submitted its further report to the Council after the statutory timeframe had elapsed. The respondent in <span class="font-italic">Zulkifli</span> argued that such a breach would disempower the Law Society from referring the matter to the court. The Court of Three Judges disagreed with the respondent and held as follows at [35]–[36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Section 87(1A) of the Act merely sets timelines for certain actions to be taken by the Law Society in certain circumstances. <span class="font-italic">They were not meant to be condition precedents necessary for the</span><span class="font-italic"> exercise of the Law Society’s powers to refer the findings of the DT to this court.</span> The modern approach as to the effect of a breach of a statutory provision is not to treat every breach as a disempowering or invalidating event. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Lang v Sassoon Samuel Bernard </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 597, the Court of Appeal endorsed the modern approach in these words (at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Judge applied this modern approach to statutory interpretation, which requires the court …:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [to look] at the whole scheme and purpose of the Act and … [weigh] the importance of the particular requirement in the context of that purpose and [ask] whether the Legislature would have intended the consequences of a strict construction, having regard to the prejudice to private rights and the claims of the public interest (if any).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question therefore was whether non-compliance with the time periods in s 87(1A) of the Act was fatal to the present proceedings. In our view, the answer was “no” as these provisions were enacted for the purpose of expediting the disposal of disciplinary proceedings – see the Second Reading speech of the Minister for Law in Parliament when moving the amendment bill …. <span class="font-italic">The amendments were no</span><span class="font-italic">t enacted to put obstacles in the way of disciplining errant advocates and solicitors who were guilty of professional misconduct. </span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 <span class="font-italic">Zulkifli </span>was a not a case concerning whether the court could grant an extension of time if a s 97 application was filed out of time.

The primary object of Pt VII of the LPA is one of regulating the legal profession: finding that s 91A is a time-limited ouster clause detracts from that object. The complainant, the Council and the AG will lose their right to review the DT’s findings and determination regardless of the merits of their application. In addition, a solicitor who is dissatisfied with the DT’s imposition of alternative sanctions in s 93(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) will also lose his right of review if he does not file his application within the 14 days’ time window.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The respondent relies on the following passage in <span class="font-italic">Top Ten </span>(at [42]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We start our analysis by considering the civil jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under ss 16 and 17 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”). The Supreme Court consists of the High Court and the Court of Appeal (see Art 94(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”) and s 3 of the SCJA). Section 16 of the SCJA provides for the general jurisdiction of the High Court with respect to <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">in personam</span> actions, and s 17 sets out the specific areas of law within its jurisdiction. The general powers of the High Court are set out in the First Schedule to the SCJA. None of these provisions refers to disciplinary proceedings. The ordinary meaning of an <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">in personam</span> action does not include a disciplinary action. In short, the civil jurisdiction of the High Court does not include jurisdiction over any disciplinary matter under Pt VII of the LPA. If the High Court has no jurisdiction over disciplinary matters, it follows that the Court of Appeal also has no jurisdiction over such matters …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I disagree with the respondent’s contention. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Top Ten </span>was making the point that in disciplinary proceedings, the Judge exercises disciplinary jurisdiction under Pt VII of the LPA, and not civil jurisdiction under ss 16 and 17 of the LPA. The Court of Appeal explained, at [44]–[45], that a Judge in the context of a s 97 application is, following s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed), “a judge of the <span class="font-italic">High Court</span> exercising disciplinary jurisdiction under Pt VII of the LPA, and not a judge of the High Court exercising civil jurisdiction under ss 16 and 17 of the SCJA”. It does not follow that because the Judge is exercising disciplinary rather than civil jurisdiction, that s 18(2) is inapplicable. In my view, given that a Judge in a s 97 application is still sitting as a Judge of the High Court, albeit exercising disciplinary jurisdiction instead of civil jurisdiction, s 18(2) of the SCJA applies and confers on the Judge the powers under the First Schedule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In this regard, a distinction ought to be drawn between a court’s <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> and a court’s <span class="font-italic">powers</span>. As stated by Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Muhd Munir v Noor Hidah and other applications </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 348 at [19]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The jurisdiction of a court is its authority, however derived, to hear and determine a dispute that is brought before it. The powers of a court constitute its capacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party to the dispute. The jurisdiction and powers of the High Court are statutorily derived. Whether it has any common law jurisdiction or powers is a question which is not relevant here. A court may have jurisdiction to hear and determine a dispute in relation to a subject matter but no power to grant a remedy or make a certain order because it has not been granted such power, whereas if a court has the power to grant a remedy or make a certain order, it can only exercise that power in a subject matter in which it has jurisdiction. The distinction between jurisdiction and power is recognised in the SCJA, ss 16 and 17 (which confer jurisdiction) and s 18 (which confers powers). …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In my judgment, a Judge hearing a s 97 application is a Judge of the High Court exercising disciplinary jurisdiction, and would have the powers vested in the High Court, including those in the First Schedule by virtue of s 18(2) of the SCJA. I therefore hold that the court has the power to extend time in a s 97 application under s 18(2) of the SCJA read with para 7 of the First Schedule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I next turn to s 97(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA. The AG contends that s 97(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA also confers on the Judge the power to extend time as that power is an “intrinsic part of the court having control over its own processes”.

</div>
</div>
</div> Section 97(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides that the Judge hearing the application “may make such orders as the Judge thinks fit”. Rather than seeing s 97(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as a stand-alone provision which confers upon the court the power to extend time, I view s 97(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) as referring to the width of the orders the court may make pursuant to its full arsenal of powers necessary to do justice in the case, which would include s 18 of the SCJA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I come to the last argument on the inherent powers of the court. As I have concluded that there is an express statutory provision, I do not rely on the court’s inherent powers. Courts would generally not invoke such powers where statutory powers are present, save in exceptional circumstances: see <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 at [81], cited by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re Nalpon Zero</span><span class="font-italic"> Geraldo Mario</span> [2013] 3 SLR 258 at [39], and <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the court should grant the Law Society an extension of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Finally, I turn to the issue of whether the Law Society should be granted an extension of time. Regarding the criteria for such an extension of time, I consider that the test for extensions of time to appeal from court decisions, found in <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another suit </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 757 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong</span>”) at [18], is relevant. In my view, it is appropriate to use the same criteria for extensions of time to apply under s 97 of the LPA against a DT’s determination, as such a determination is made after a trial on charges, similar to court proceedings. The single judge hearing such an application exercises appellate jurisdiction: see [25]–[26] above on my views on the supervisory and appellate jurisdiction. While in this case parties relied on grounds for judicial review of the DT’s determination, I do not think the inclusion and consolidation of judicial review should displace the standard that should be in play for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction. Consonant with the parliamentary intent of having a single process governing both the court’s appellate and supervisory jurisdiction, the same criteria should apply whether an applicant in a s 97 application seeks to invoke the court’s supervisory and/or appellate jurisdiction, for reasons of coherence and consistency. On a related note, in respect of judicial review, I note that O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) specifies the criteria for granting extensions of time to applications for quashing orders. The applicant must ensure that “the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge”. It is an open question as to whether this exception, which the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Per Ah Seng Robin and another v Housing and Development Board and another </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1020 (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">Per Ah Seng</span>”) referred to as the “delay exception”, applies where statute prescribes a time period, as in the present case: <span class="font-italic">Per Ah Seng </span>at [46]. Notwithstanding, <span class="font-italic">Top Ten </span>states at [34] that disciplinary proceedings under the LPA are “specialised forms of inquisitorial proceedings with adversarial elements … and judicial proceedings … to which the Rules of Court are not applicable because they are not civil proceedings as defined in those rules”. For the various reasons explained above, therefore, I am of the view that the <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong</span> factors are appropriate to the issue of extensions of time to apply under s 97 of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 These factors are the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The length of the delay;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The reasons for the delay;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The merits of the application;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The prejudice to the respondent if the extension of time was to be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 These factors are not to be applied mechanically. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo </span>[2011] 2 SLR 196 at [30], “it is the overall picture that emerges to the court as to where the justice of the case lies which will ultimately be decisive”. The four factors are of equal importance and are to be balanced amongst one another, having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case concerned: <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong </span>at [28].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Turning to the facts at hand, the Determination was received by the Law Society on 29 May 2019.

</div>
</div> There was thus a delay of 13 days. As for the reasons for the delay, I was informed by the Law Society that some time and effort was expended to seek the views of Senior Counsel to review the Determination. A special meeting was convened on 21 June 2019 for Council to consider the Determination and there was a vote to determine if the matter should be reviewed pursuant to s 97 of the LPA. The vote closed on 24 June 2019 and the application was filed the next day. With respect, these reasons do not provide strong justification for the delay of close </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">to two weeks. Nevertheless, I place significant weight on the fact that there are strong merits to the application to set aside the Determination, for all the reasons I have explained above. In the context of considering an extension of time to appeal, the court adopts a “very low threshold”, the test is whether the appeal is “hopeless”: see <span class="font-italic">ARW v Comptroller of Income Tax and another and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 499 (“<span class="font-italic">ARW</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [76]. Using this threshold, the strong merits to the application ought to render this a particularly weighty factor. As for the last factor, prejudice, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ARW </span>explained that the court is entitled to take into account the prejudice to the respondent, but also to the applicant and the public interest: <span class="font-italic">ARW </span>at [80]. In my view, this factor is particularly relevant in an application to file a s 97 application out of time, given the public interest in regulating advocates and solicitors who might be guilty of misconduct: see [123] above. In any event, the AG’s application in OS 812/2019 does not require an extension of time: the present circumstances are therefore such that the outcome of a grant of an extension to the Law Society would not result in any change in the final orders made. In the circumstances, taking matters in the round, I consider that the interests of justice lies in favour of granting an extension of time to the Law Society to file OS 810/2019. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In conclusion, the Determination is set aside in its entirety pursuant to s 97(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA. The Law Society is to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of another DT to hear and investigate the Complaint. Fresh charges are to be framed for these purposes and fresh counsel instructed by the Law Society. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The AG, the Law Society and the respondent have confirmed that they would not ask for costs regardless of the result of these applications. I therefore make no order on costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gregory Vijayendran SC (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP), Jason Lim and Teng Boon Hui (De Souza Lim &amp; Goh LLP) for the applicant in OS 810/2019;<br/>Kristy Tan and Jamie Pang (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the applicant in OS 812/2019;<br/>Chelva Rajah SC (Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah) for the respondent.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
