        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal concerns an alleged breach by the
                    appellant, Mr Anthony Sabastian Aurol (“Aurol”), of an interim
                    sealing order made by an Assistant Registrar (“the AR”). Upon the
                    application of the respondent, Sembcorp Marine Ltd (“SCM”), in
                    Originating Summons No 465 of 2011 (“OS 465 of 2011”) for an
                    order of committal against Aurol for contempt of court, Aurol was found guilty
                    by the High Court and sentenced to five days’ imprisonment. The decision
                    of the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) finding Aurol guilty of
                    contempt is reported in <em>Sembcorp Marine Ltd v Aurol Anthony
                        Sabastian</em> [2012] 2 SLR 645.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The present appeal is brought by Aurol against
                    his conviction and sentence. It was heard together with Civil Appeal No 66
                    of 2012 (“CA 66 of 2012”), which was Aurol’s appeal
                    against the refusal of the High Court to grant him leave to adduce further
                    evidence at a very late stage in the proceedings below. Following brief oral
                    arguments before us, we dismissed CA 66 of 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The background to the present appeal revolves
                    around a related action in Suit 351 of 2010 (“Suit 351”)
                    which was brought by SCM and PPL Shipyard Pte Ltd (“PPLS”) against
                    PPL Holdings Pte Ltd (“PPLH”) and E-Interface Holdings Limited.
                    SCM had entered into a joint venture with PPLH pursuant to which each party was
                    to and did come to own shares in PPLS. Under the joint venture agreement, each
                    party was granted pre-emption rights in the event the other party wished to sell
                    its shares. However, the parent company of PPLH, Baker Technology Ltd
                    (“Baker”), which was not a party to the joint venture agreement,
                    sold its shares in PPLH to a competitor of SCM, ostensibly by-passing the
                    restrictions imposed by the pre-emption rights. This subsequently led to the
                    filing of Suit 351 by SCM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Aurol was a director of Baker, PPLH and PPLS at
                    the material time. He also had indirect interests in Baker and had played a
                    central role in arranging the sale of Baker’s shareholding in PPLH to
                    SCM’s competitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Wong Weng Sun (“Wong”) is the
                    President and Chief Executive Officer of SCM. He filed various affidavits in
                    Suit 351 in that capacity. In his 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit
                    (“Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit”) filed on
                    26 November 2010, Wong set out fairly detailed information about the SCM
                    Group’s foreign exchange hedging policies. It subsequently occurred to SCM
                    that this was confidential information and if the release of that information
                    into the public domain was not restrained, it could be exploited by non-parties
                    to the detriment of the SCM Group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> On 3 December 2010, SCM filed Summons 5659
                    of 2010 (“SUM 5659”) seeking a sealing order in relation to
                    various documents including Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SUM 5659</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Specifically, the following reliefs were sought
                    in SUM 5659:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     That SUM 5659 itself and all its
                        contents including the supporting affidavit be sealed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     That Wong’s
                            4<sup>th</sup> affidavit be sealed from non-parties to
                        Suit 351; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     That any further affidavit in Suit 351 containing references to,
                        or quotations or extracts from exhibit WWS-47 to Wong’s
                            4<sup>th</sup> affidavit, be sealed from non-parties to
                        Suit 351.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The affidavit filed in support of
                    SUM 5659 and referred to in [6(a)] above was Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit. SUM 5659 and Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit were filed together on
                    3 December 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interim Sealing Order of 6 December 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 6 December 2010, counsel for SCM
                    appeared <em>ex parte</em> before the AR on duty, seeking
                    an urgent hearing date for SUM 5659 to be heard by a High Court Judge. The
                    minutes of the hearing before the AR were recorded on the backing sheet of the
                    summons and read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bernette Meyer and Mr Issac Lum for Pf</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">PC: Application is for the sealing of an affidavit that my client has
                        filed a week before, on 26 Nov 2010. And also any further affidavits filed
                        in this Suit which refers to a exhibit WWS-47 in that affidavit. Other side
                        expected to file an affidavit this Friday. Seeking an urgent hearing date
                        for this sealing application. And also to ask that in the interim, before
                        that hearing, for this affidavit to be sealed such that non-parties to the
                        suit cannot inspect the affidavit. We asked for consent to the sealing last
                        week but did not receive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ct: Application fixed for Friday 10 December 2010 on the usual OS SUMS
                        list at 9am. In the interim (till the hearing of the application), Mr Wong
                        Weng Sun’s 5<sup>th</sup> supporting affidavit dated
                        26 November 2010, together with the summons, are to be sealed as against
                        non-parties to the Suit. To serve on all parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As it turned out, the AR had made a mistake:
                    Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit was dated 3 December
                    2010, not 26 November 2010; it was Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit that was dated 26 November
                    2010. The AR’s order was not extracted in the usual way. As a result, this
                    notation on the backing sheet of the summons is the only record of the order
                    that was made by the AR on 6 December 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">6 December 2010 letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On the same day, after the AR had made the
                    interim sealing order, SCM’s lawyers, Drew &amp; Napier LLC
                    (“Drew”), wrote to the lawyers acting for the defendants in
                    Suit 351, Straits Law Practice LLC (“Straits Law”), informing
                    them of the hearing date for SUM 5659. The letter also stated the
                        following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Please be informed that the Court has granted an interim order that

                        support of the Summons be sealed as against non-parties to the Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 7 December 2010, Drew served a copy of
                    SUM 5659, the interim sealing order (as recorded on the backing sheet of
                    the summons) as well as Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit on
                    Straits Law. It is undisputed that copies of SUM 5659, the interim order,
                    Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit and Drew’s letter of
                    6 December 2010 were sent to Aurol on or prior to 9 December
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It is also undisputed that
                    Aurol had received and read all of these documents on or before that
                        date.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Aurol’s conversation with Conrad Raj on 10 December

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mr Conrad Raj (“Raj”) is a
                    senior journalist with the Today Newspaper (“Today”) and an old
                    friend of Aurol’s. Raj had previously published an article on 2 July
                    2010 in Today, commenting on the fall-out between SCM and Baker. Raj and Aurol
                    had a telephone conversation on 10 December 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> There is some
                    dispute as to whether it was Raj who called Aurol or the other way around; there

                    conversation.</p>

                    following from their conversation, Aurol emailed a copy of SUM 5659 and
                    Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit to Raj.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 13 December 2010 Today article</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 13 December 2010, an article written
                    by Raj was published in Today detailing the fact that SUM 5659 had been
                    filed and setting out the reasons for the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This prompted an immediate reaction from SCM.
                    Its lawyers wrote to Mediacorp Pte Ltd (“Mediacorp”) which owned
                    and published Today, drawing attention to the alleged breach of the interim
                    sealing order and asking Mediacorp to name the source of the information which
                    Raj had published in his article. Upon Mediacorp’s refusal to reveal its
                    source, SCM commenced Originating Summons No 74 of 2011 (“OS 74 of
                    2011”) against Mediacorp.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mediacorp ordered to reveal its source</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 7 March 2011, the AR who heard
                    OS 74 of 2011 at first instance ordered Mediacorp to reveal its source.
                    Mediacorp appealed this decision but the order was upheld by the High Court on
                    31 March 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The apology</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 5 April 2011, Aurol wrote to the High
                    Court and SCM. The letter was written on a PPLH letterhead but was signed by
                    Aurol as a director. Aurol appeared to have identified himself as the source of
                    the leak. He also stated as follows in the letter:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We humbly and sincerely apologise to this Honourable Court for breaching

                    2011 and pursuant to O 52 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R
                    5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”), SCM commenced committal
                    proceedings against Aurol. Leave was granted by the Court on 30 June 2011.
                    On 1 July 2011, SCM filed Summons 2861 of 2011 to apply for an order
                    that Aurol be committed to prison for contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In coming to his decision, the Judge first

                    Aurol’s background, he must have known the difference between a summons
                    and an affidavit. Yet, Aurol had failed to offer any satisfactory explanation as
                    to how he could possibly have misread the order in relation to the summons
                        itself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In relation to the reference to the affidavit,
                    the Judge found that while there might have been some ambiguity arising from the
                    misdescription referred to above, given that it was also described in the
                    interim sealing order as a “supporting affidavit”, and further
                    given Drew’s letter of 6 December 2010, no ambiguity or doubt could
                    have persisted. In short, the Judge thought that these matters, taken together
                    would have been sufficient to dispel any ambiguity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Judge concluded that he was permitted to
                    consider all the surrounding facts and circumstances, including Drew’s
                    letter of 6 December 2010 to ascertain the real meaning and purport of the
                    interim sealing order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Judge then considered the purpose of
                    the order and determined that there was a real risk of interference with the
                    administration of justice as a consequence of its being deliberately
                    disobeyed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Judge also found that Aurol had the
                    specific intent to breach the order and found Aurol’s explanation that he
                    had not read Drew’s letter of 6 December 2010 in detail unconvincing,
                    as it was bald and evasive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In the Judge’s
                    view, Aurol’s failure to produce his phone records to show who had
                    initiated the conversation with Raj, his failure to produce the email he sent to
                    Raj or to give any explanation for this failure, as well as Raj’s
                    affidavit which appeared to contradict Aurol’s evidence, all pointed to
                    the fact that Aurol had deliberately piqued Raj’s interest before sending
                    him the email with SUM 5659 and Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit attached while asking Raj to keep his identity strictly
                        confidential.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In addition, the Judge considered it
                    significant that Aurol had failed to own up immediately after SCM instituted
                    OS 74 of 2011 and instead waited until after the High Court had affirmed
                    the AR’s order to compel Mediacorp to reveal its source. The Judge was
                    also troubled by the terms of the letter sent by Straits Law on behalf of Aurol
                    on 5 April 2011 to convey his apology, observing that the letter had been
                    carefully and deliberately crafted. As a result of all this, the Judge concluded
                    that Aurol’s actions were neither innocent nor unintentional.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Finally, the Judge held that there was a real
                    risk of interference with the administration of justice because the breach by
                    Aurol was not merely technical, but had the effect of destroying or nullifying
                    the purpose of the order. This was thought to be so especially in the light of
                    the fact that the situation was (and would have been known to be) irreversible
                    once Aurol had successfully used Raj to make public what the AR had ordered to
                    be sealed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Aurol’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the appeal, Aurol’s first argument
                    was that the interim sealing order is to be distinguished from injunctive relief
                    which takes the form of an express non-disclosure order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Mr George Lim SC (“Mr
                    Lim”), who appeared for Aurol, argued that his client should not be held
                    in contempt for disclosing SUM 5659 and Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit to Raj even assuming those
                    documents were clearly covered by the terms of the interim sealing order because
                    at its highest the order that had been made by the AR was just that: an interim
                    sealing order the effect of which was only to seal the court file but not to
                    prevent disclosure of materials from the file where this did not require any
                    inspection of the court file. According to Mr Lim, the order would only have
                    proscribed such disclosure if it had been an express non-disclosure
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mr Lim then submitted that the terms of the
                    interim sealing order were ambiguous and it was impermissible for the Judge to
                    have considered the extraneous circumstances that he did in his effort to infer
                    the intended scope and purpose of the order. Specifically, it was contended that
                    the Judge had made a number of errors in interpreting the interim sealing order.
                    First, Mr Lim argued that the Judge had erred because in fact, SCM’s
                    lawyers had applied only for Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit to be sealed. Second, it was submitted that the Judge erred because he
                    should not have relied on Drew’s letter of 6 December 2010 to
                    determine the meaning or interpretation of the interim sealing order. Finally,
                    Mr Lim submitted that the Judge erred in placing undue reliance on the words
                    “supporting affidavit” to dispel the ambiguity which was inherent
                    in the order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Lim also submitted that criminal contempt
                    proceedings fall within the supervision and jurisdiction of the Attorney-General
                    (“the AG”) in his role as the Public Prosecutor and guardian of
                    the public interest. Thus, SCM’s application ought at least to have been
                    sanctioned by the Attorney-General’s Chambers, which it was not. Mr Lim
                    contended that the proceedings were also doomed to fail on account of
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">SCM’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In response, Mr Davinder Singh SC (“Mr
                    Singh”) who appeared for SCM, argued that Aurol had failed to demonstrate
                    that the Judge had erred in his central finding that the real and central
                    purpose of making the interim sealing order was to preserve the <em>status quo</em> and specifically to prevent the disclosure
                    and publication of the protected information before SUM 5659 had been
                    substantively disposed of by the Court. Mr Singh submitted that Aurol’s
                    arguments conflated the terms of the interim sealing order with its purpose.
                    According to Mr Singh, the purpose of the interim order, when construed in the
                    circumstances of the case, was clear and unambiguous, and indeed was known to
                    Aurol. This was to preserve the <em>status quo</em> pending
                    the substantive disposal of SCM’s application. Yet, Aurol had deliberately
                    disclosed the sealed documents to Raj as part of a deliberate plan to stimulate
                    Raj’s interest in the matter and to induce him to write an article that
                    would embarrass SCM. In doing so, Aurol’s actions posed a real risk of
                    interfering with the administration of justice as the purposes underlying the
                    interim sealing order had been compromised if not destroyed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On Aurol’s contention that the criminal
                    contempt proceedings ought first to have been sanctioned by the AG, Mr Singh
                    argued that unlike the position in England, there are no specific statutory
                    provisions in Singapore that limit the power to initiate certain types of
                    contempt proceedings to the AG. Indeed, Mr Singh submitted that the law in
                    Singapore is that any interested party may, with the leave of the court, bring
                    proceedings for criminal contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues raised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The following principal issues arise for our
                    consideration in the appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     As a preliminary matter, whether a
                        party is obliged to consult or to obtain the sanction of the AG before
                        commencing proceedings for criminal contempt;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the terms of the interim sealing order
                        were ambiguous and, if so, whether the High Court erred in relying on
                        Drew’s letter of 6 December 2010 to dispel the ambiguity;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the
                        offence of criminal contempt could be made out in the circumstances even
                        though the order was a sealing order and not an express non-disclosure
                        order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there is an obligation to consult or to obtain the sanction
                of the AG before commencing proceedings for criminal contempt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As a preliminary point, it may be noted that
                    the present action is one for criminal contempt and not for civil contempt. An
                    action for civil contempt is directed at a party who is bound by an order of
                    court but is alleged to have breached the terms of that order. Such an action is
                    directed at securing compliance with the order in question. An action for
                    criminal contempt on the other hand need not be confined to parties who are
                    directly bound by the order. Any person, even one not directly bound by the
                    order, can act so as to deliberately frustrate or undermine its purpose but if
                    he does that, then he commits criminal contempt. There was no question here of
                    an action for civil contempt being taken to secure Aurol’s compliance with
                    the interim sealing order. First, Aurol was not personally a party to that
                    order. Second, the order had already been breached in circumstances where the
                    breach could not be reversed. Rather, this was an action taken to punish Aurol
                    for the asserted criminal contempt founded on his allegedly deliberate actions
                    calculated to frustrate the purposes of the interim sealing order. In short,
                    this was a prosecution for a crime that Aurol was alleged to have
                    committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Constitutional Role of the AG</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     By virtue of s 11(1) of the Criminal
                    Procedure Code 2010 (Act No 15 of 2010) (“CPC 2010”) the
                    AG is the Public Prosecutor and in him, in general, is vested the control and
                    direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings. Section 11(1) of the
                    CPC 2010 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Attorney-General shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the
                        control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings <em>under this Code or any other written law.</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     But, s 11 of the CPC 2010 does not
                    provide an immediate answer to the question of the role of the AG in relation to
                    the present proceedings. Singapore’s contempt of court law “is
                    based on common law and is an anomaly in our criminal justice system, as all our
                    criminal laws are statute-based” (see Chan Sek Keong, Chief Justice,
                    “Opening of Legal Year 2010” Response Speech (2 January 2010)
                    at para 21). What then is the position in relation to a prosecution, anomalous
                    though it be, that is brought under the common law?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     At first blush, the position is apparently
                    made somewhat clearer by Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of
                    Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”),
                    which constitutionally enshrines the integral role played by the AG in the
                    institution and conduct of <em>all</em> criminal
                    proceedings. Art 35(8) of the Constitution reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to
                        institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Notably, Art 35(8) of the Constitution
                    does not circumscribe the power of the AG only to criminal proceedings initiated
                    under any written law: it is thus intended to govern <em>all</em> criminal proceedings, whether initiated pursuant to a
                    statute or under the common law. Art 35(8) of the Constitution has been
                    judicially interpreted in many cases, and most notably in <em>Law
                        Society of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239
                        (“<em>Phyllis Tan</em>”) at [145] to mean
                    the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In relation to public prosecutions, Art 35(8) makes it clear that the
                            <em>institution, conduct or discontinuance</em> of
                            <b><em>any</em></b> criminal proceedings is a matter for
                        only the Attorney-General to decide. This means that except for
                        unconstitutionality, the Attorney-General has an unfettered
                        discretion as to when and how he exercises his prosecutorial powers.
                        … [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Insofar as it is a matter of the AG’s
                    power and discretion, the position is clear. There is no doubt that the AG has
                    the power to institute and conduct prosecutions and proceedings for criminal
                    contempt and this is reflected in the many cases where the AG has done so before
                    our courts. But, it has also been held that Art 35(8) of the Constitution
                    does not prevent other persons from commencing private prosecutions in the
                    permitted circumstances. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Norzian bin
                        Bintat</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 105 at [19], the High Court held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not disputed that in certain circumstances an aggrieved person may
                        commence a private prosecution for certain offences without the consent of
                        the Attorney-General. Thus, it is uncontroversial that the Attorney-General
                        does not have the sole discretion to institute or conduct criminal
                        proceedings ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Similarly, in <em>Attorney-General v Tee Kok Boon</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 412 at [68], the
                    High Court held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 35 deals with the office of the Attorney-General and matters
                        incidental thereto such as the appointment of the Attorney-General, his
                        duties and powers. I am of the view that while Art 35(8) states his power to
                        institute proceedings for any offence, it does not preclude others from
                        instituting criminal proceedings as may be prescribed by written law. The
                        Attorney-General has overall control over criminal proceedings. As
                        mentioned, the Attorney-General may intervene even in private
                        prosecutions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Insofar as the prosecution of statutory
                    offences is concerned, the rights of private individuals to initiate
                    prosecutions are set out in the CPC 2010 and in broad terms, these may be
                    summarised thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     Pursuant to s 10 of the CPC 2010,
                        the prosecution of the offences that are listed in that section may not be
                        initiated without the consent of the Public Prosecutor;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     Subject to this, a private prosecution
                        may be initiated pursuant to s 11(10) of the CPC 2010 if it is:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_36-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       for a summary case before a
                            Magistrate’s Court; and</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The rationale for this was explained in
                        <em>Cheng William v Loo Ngee Long Edmund</em> [2001] 2
                    SLR(R) 626 as follows at [16]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It would seem that these provisions squarely contemplate <em>the risks particular to private prosecutions, where the
                            complainant may allow his "private passions and prejudices to creep into
                            the conduct" of a criminal appeal (Ponniah v Lim</em> [1960] MLJ
                        152 ). A private prosecution is a prosecution by a private individual
                        which, if successful, relies on the state machinery to mete out the sentence
                        imposed. In addition, a criminal offence is based on the notion of a wrong
                        committed against society or social values. It follows that <em>a private prosecution should not defeat the interests of state
                            and society</em> (such interests in this context being determined
                        by the Public Prosecutor). [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     But what is the position in relation to the
                    prosecution of an offence founded in the common law? The present proceedings had
                    to be brought in the High Court. Moreover, it was for an offence against the
                    administration of justice and bears some resemblance to some of the offences
                    identified in s 10 of the CPC 2010 as requiring the prior consent of the
                    Public Prosecutor – see for instance s 228 of the Penal Code (Cap
                    224, 2008 Rev Ed). The proposition that such a prosecution for criminal contempt
                    could be initiated in the High Court without <em>any</em>
                    involvement of the Public Prosecutor would seem somewhat out of step with the
                    statutory framework, though we recognise that this may well be the position
                    ultimately since the offence concerned is a unique and anomalous one rooted in
                    the common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In England, the issue was specifically
                    considered by the <em>Report of the Committee on Contempt of
                        Court</em> (Cmnd 5794, 1974) (“the Phillimore Committee
                    report”). Mr Singh relied on the Phillimore Committee report at para 184
                    to argue that any interested person can bring proceedings for criminal
                        contempt.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The paragraph reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">184. In general, contempt proceedings, like most other proceedings, civil
                        or criminal, may be instituted by a private individual. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The English position is not entirely
                    equivalent to ours because of the greater prevalence of criminal law founded in
                    the common law there. But even so, the Phillimore Committee report goes on to
                    state at para 187:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>We are sure that the Attorney General must retain his
                            right to act in the public interest where he thinks fit to do
                            so.</b> Experience shows that such occasions are relatively rare,
                        especially in connection with civil proceedings. But we are also sure that
                        his should not be an exclusive jurisdiction. Although contempt is a public
                        offence in the sense of being an interference with the course of justice, it
                        is usually private individuals who are affected by it, and <em>if for one reason or another the Attorney General decides not
                            to act</em>, the individual should have the right to test the
                        matter in the courts. There are special reasons for such exceptions as exist
                        to the general principle that prosecutions may be privately brought. We do
                        not consider that the reasons here suffice to make contempt a further
                        exception; and the present position has not resulted in many private
                        proceedings for contempt in recent years. If any general restriction upon
                        private prosecutions were to be imposed in the future, then no doubt the
                        position in the law of contempt should be considered. <b>We
                            believe, however, that the normal practice should be, especially where
                            the alleged contempt is in relation to criminal proceedings, that the
                            attention of the Attorney General should be drawn to the matter before
                            any private proceedings are begun.</b> ... [emphasis in original
                        in bold; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Thus the Phillimore Committee concluded in
                    1974 that the right of the AG to act was not exclusive, but it also suggested
                    that the institution of an action by a private individual ought only to take
                    place “<em>if for one reason or another the AG decides not
                        to act</em>” (emphasis added). This contemplates that there is
                    a need to first consult the AG but reserving the possibility of proceeding with
                    a private prosecution for criminal contempt in the event that the AG decides not
                    to act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It may be noted that the position in England
                    was modified by s 7 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 (c 49) (UK)
                    (“UK Contempt of Court Act 1981”) which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Proceedings for a contempt of court under the strict liability rule (other
                        than Scottish proceedings) shall not be instituted except by or with the
                        consent of the Attorney-General or on the motion of a court having
                        jurisdiction to deal with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Under s 2(1) of the UK Contempt of Court
                    Act 1981, proceedings under the strict liability rule refer to those brought in
                    relation to publications which are addressed to the public at large. Thus, in
                    England, in relation to contempt by publication at least, the position has been
                    that proceedings may only be instituted either by, or with the consent of, the
                    AG or on the motion of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Outside the realm of the UK Contempt of Court
                    Act 1981, while the position under the English common law remains that the
                    consent of the AG is not strictly required, it has been noted in many instances
                    that it is desirable that the aggrieved party should place the facts before the
                    AG prior to instituting proceedings himself (see for instance David Eady &amp;
                    A.T.H. Smith, <em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on
                        Contempt</em> (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011)
                        (“<em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on
                    Contempt</em>”) at para 3-181). This view also finds support in a
                    number of judicial pronouncements. Lord Cross of Chelsea in <em>Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd</em> [1974] AC 273
                        (“<em>Times Newspapers</em>”) observed
                    thus at 326–327:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It is, I think, most desirable that in civil as well as in
                        criminal cases anyone who thinks that a criminal contempt of court has been
                        or is about to be committed should, if possible, place the facts before the
                        Attorney-General for him to consider whether or not those facts appear to
                        disclose a contempt of court of sufficient gravity to warrant his bringing
                        the matter to the notice of the court. Of course, in some cases it may be
                        essential if an application is to be made at all for it to be made promptly
                        and there may be no time for the person affected by the
                        “contempt” to put the facts before the Attorney before moving
                        himself. Again the fact that the Attorney declines to take up the case will
                        not prevent the complainant from seeking to persuade the court that
                        notwithstanding the refusal of the Attorney to act the matter complained of
                        does in fact constitute a contempt of which the court should take notice.
                        Yet again, of course, there may be cases where a serious contempt appears to
                        have been committed but for one reason or another none of the parties
                        affected by it wishes any action to be taken in respect of it. In such cases
                        if the facts come to the knowledge of the Attorney from some other source he
                        will naturally himself bring the matter to the attention of the
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In <em>Dobson and another v
                        Hastings and others</em> [1992] Ch 394 at 411, the Court found that
                    the issue was a “far reaching” one which called for extensive
                    treatment, especially in light of the cases. The following observations of the
                    Court at 411 are noteworthy:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, at the close of the submissions Mr Gray presented an argument
                        that Mr Dobson and Mr Woodward were not competent as applicants on the
                        present committal motion. Only the Attorney-General can initiate contempt
                        proceedings where the contempt alleged is not that of breaching or assisting
                        in the breach of a court order. Where a breach of a court order is asserted
                        the party to the litigation in which the order was made can himself launch
                        contempt proceedings. But when the contempt is not based on a breach of a
                        court order, the Attorney General alone has locus standi. Mr Gray presented
                        his submission crisply and succinctly, basing himself largely on
                        observations of the House of Lords in <em>Gouriet v. Union of
                            Post Office Workers</em> [1978] AC 435 to the effect that it is
                        the exclusive right of the Attorney-General to represent the public
                        interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is a far reaching argument. I am not persuaded that the matter is as
                        cut and dried as Mr Gray would have it. I am fortified in this view by
                        noting that, when addressing this category of contempt in <em>Attorney General v Newspaper Publishing Plc.</em> [1988] Ch 333,
                        362, Sir John Donaldson MR stated guardedly that “in general”
                        this form of contempt was a matter for the Attorney General to raise.
                        Further, in <em>P v. Liverpool Daily Post and Echo Newspapers
                            Plc.</em> [1991] 2 AC 370, 425, Lord Bridge of Harwich regarded
                        this as a difficult point, on which the Attorney-General should be heard. In
                        my view this important point calls for more extended treatment than it was
                        accorded before me. It is a point I ought not to decide unless that is
                        necessary ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In <em>Pelling v
                        Hammond</em> (C/00/2363), September 22, 2000 (cited in <em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt</em> at para
                    3-181), on an application for permission to appeal the refusal of the Divisional
                    Court to grant leave to bring proceedings for contempt, Laws LJ opined that
                    as the allegation was one of criminal contempt, he had considerable doubts as to
                    the applicant’s standing and said that it was “certainly desirable
                    and perhaps necessary for the Attorney-General to be approached to see whether
                    he should bring contempt proceedings”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     To similar effect is the decision of the
                    Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Young v United States
                        ex rel Vuitton et Fils, SA</em> (1987) 481 US 787 (“<em>Young</em>”) where it was held that a person charged
                    with contempt <em>has</em> a right to a disinterested
                    prosecutor. In <em>Young</em>, the petitioners had violated
                    injunctions that were the result of a settlement of a lawsuit with Louis Vuitton
                    SA, the French luxury goods manufacturer. Two of Louis Vuitton’s legal
                    representatives had requested the District Court to appoint them as private
                    prosecutors to represent the United States in the investigation and prosecution
                    of the petitioners infringing activity. The District Court acceded to that
                    request. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the petitioners argued that the
                    appointment of Louis Vuitton’s legal counsel as special prosecutors
                    violated their right to be prosecuted only by an impartial
                prosecutor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Justice Brennan, who delivered the majority
                    decision of the Court, observed at 814 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A prosecutor of a contempt action who represents the private
                        beneficiary of the court order allegedly violated cannot provide such
                        assurance, for such an attorney is required by the very standards of the
                        profession to serve two masters. The appointment of counsel for Vuitton to
                        conduct the contempt prosecution in these cases therefore was
                        improper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The facts in <em>Young</em> are slightly different from those in the case at hand
                    because the appointment of Louis Vuitton’s legal representatives as
                    private prosecutors entailed also conferring certain investigatory powers upon
                    them, over and above the power to bring proceedings. But given that the end
                    result of a private prosecution for criminal contempt is the imposition of penal
                    sanctions on the contemnor for acting to the detriment of the public interest,
                    the observations of Justice Brennan in <em>Young</em> about
                    the desirability of a disinterested prosecutor are apposite here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Indeed, in our view given the <em>sui generis</em> nature of criminal contempt, there is a
                    compelling interest in the AG being consulted before proceedings are commenced
                    by a private party. We note that an action for criminal contempt may even arise
                    out of civil proceedings either through a contumelious breach of a court order
                    or the intentional subversion of its purpose. It is commenced by an application
                    for committal brought pursuant to O 52 r 2 of the Rules of Court and
                    may then be decided solely on affidavit evidence – even though guilt has
                    to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As Lord Diplock observed in <em>Times Newspapers</em> at 311–312:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The remedy for contempt of court after it has been committed is
                        punitive; it may involve imprisonment, yet it is summary; <em>it is generally obtained on affidavit evidence</em> and <em>it is not accompanied by those special safeguards in favour of
                            the accused that are a feature of the trial of an ordinary criminal
                            offence</em>. Furthermore, it is a procedure which if instituted
                        by one of the parties to litigation is open to abuse ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In our judgment, this particular facet of
                    proceedings brought for criminal contempt more than anything else, clearly
                    distinguishes it from other criminal offences where an aggrieved person may
                    commence a private prosecution without first obtaining the AG’s
                    consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     SCM’s contention that any interested
                    party may, with leave of court, bring proceedings for criminal contempt because
                    of the absence of specific statutory provisions in Singapore that confine the
                    power to initiate certain types of contempt proceedings to the AG, in our view
                    misses the point. In Singapore, as reflected in Art 35(8) of the
                    Constitution, the AG plays a unique and integral role as guardian of the public
                    interest <em>vis-à-vis</em> the institution and conduct of
                        <em>all</em> criminal proceedings. This includes
                    proceedings for criminal contempt. While we acknowledge that a private
                    individual is entitled to institute proceedings for criminal contempt, in our
                    judgment, such an individual is obliged, at least in the absence of any
                    particular concerns of urgency, to first consult the AG, as the disinterested
                    prosecutor and guardian of the public interest, before commencing the
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Thus, prior to commencing committal
                    proceedings against Aurol under O 52 r 2 of the Rules of Court for
                    criminal contempt, SCM ought to have first consulted the AG. Had the AG then
                    decided to take up the matter, he would have been doing so pursuant to his
                    constitutional power to take conduct of the prosecution; had he declined to
                    prosecute the matter, SCM could then have commenced proceedings of its own
                    accord but in doing so it would have been obliged to join the AG as a party and
                    lay all the facts before the court including any expressed views of the AG. This
                    would enable the court to have the benefit of the AG’s views in coming to
                    a decision as to whether the matter should be pursued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In our view, this strikes an appropriate
                    balance between allowing private individuals to retain the right to initiate
                    proceedings for criminal contempt, while ensuring that there is adequate
                    oversight by the AG, in his special position as disinterested prosecutor and
                    guardian of the public interest. We are especially alive to the danger noted in
                        <em>Young</em>, that a prosecutor of a contempt action
                    who represents the private beneficiary of the order that has allegedly been
                    violated does not provide a meaningful or sufficient assurance of an impartial
                    prosecution. By mandating that such a party first consult the AG before
                    commencing action, there is the added advantage that any contumelious conduct
                    which may lead to an interference with the administration of justice is brought
                    to the attention of the AG, who might otherwise not even be aware of such
                    conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The AG’s disinclination to commence
                    proceedings for criminal contempt will not necessarily be determinative of the
                    court’s decision in relation to either the granting of leave under
                    O 52 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court, or the eventual making of an order
                    for committal. The court will determine each case on its merits, although it
                    will also take the AG’s views into consideration. As the Court held in
                        <em>Phyllis Tan</em> at [146]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The prosecutorial power cannot circumscribe the judicial power.
                        On the contrary, it is the judicial power that may circumscribe the
                        prosecutorial power in two ways: First, the court may declare the wrongful
                        exercise of the prosecutorial power as unconstitutional. … Secondly,
                        it is an established principle that when an accused is brought before a
                        court, the proceedings thereafter are subject to the control of the court:
                        see <em>Goh Cheng Chuan v PP</em> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 660,
                            <em>Ridgeway</em> at 32-33 and <em>Looseley</em> at [16]-[17]. Within the limits of its judicial and
                        statutory powers, the court may deal with the case as it thinks fit in
                        accordance with the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inherent jurisdiction of the court to punish for contempt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The source of the judicial power mentioned
                    above is, of course, enshrined in Art 93 of the Constitution, which
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in
                        such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time
                        being in force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In relation to the power to punish for
                    contempt of court, s 7(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,
                    2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) specifically provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The High Court and the Court of Appeal shall have the power to punish for
                        contempt of court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In our view, s 7(1) of the SCJA preserves
                    the court’s inherent jurisdiction to protect its own process and authority
                    by proceeding on its own motion in cases where its authority is threatened or
                    undermined. In <em>Churchman v Joint Shop Stewards’
                        Committee of the Workers of the Port of London</em> [1972] 1 WLR 1094,
                    Lord Denning MR made the following observations at 1100–1101:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would like to add this: Mr. Churchman and Mr. Cartwright themselves did
                        not seek to commit the three dockers to prison. All that they did —
                        or, rather, was done on their behalf — was that they reported to the
                        Industrial Court, as that court had directed them to do, any breaches of the
                        order. It was in pursuance of that direction that Mr. Churchman and Mr.
                        Cartwright, or those acting on their behalf, brought this matter to the
                        attention of the court. I do not say that the court was not entitled to act
                        as it did. <em>It may be that in some circumstances the court
                            may be entitled, on sufficient information being brought before it, to
                            act on its own initiative in sending a contemnor to prison.</em>
                        But, if it does so think fit to act, it seems to me that <em>all the safeguards required by the High Court must still be
                            satisfied.</em> The notice which is given to the accused must give
                        with it the charges against him with all the particularity which this court
                        or the High Court here ordinarily requires before depriving a person of his
                        liberty. The accused must be given notice of any new charge and the
                        opportunity of meeting it. Even if he does not appear to answer it, it must
                        be proved with all the sufficiency which we habitually require before
                        depriving a man of his liberty. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In <em>Seaward v Paterson</em>
                    [1897] 1 Ch 545 (<em>“Seaward”</em>), in punishing a
                    stranger to the litigation who had aided and abetted a breach of an injunction,
                    the Court made clear that it was acting on the basis of its inherent right to
                    punish conduct which obstructs the course of justice. As Rigby LJ observed at
                    559–560:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I entirely dissent from the suggestion that when once the court is
                        seised of the matter any party to the action can exercise any influence
                        whatever. <em>The court acts upon its own jurisdiction and
                            upon its own authority, though doubtless it would have due regard to the
                            wishes and feelings of the person who has brought the matter before it.
                            ...</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Rigby LJ’s observations were cited with
                    approval by Sir John Donaldson in the case of <em>Con-Mech
                        (Engineers) Ltd v Amalgamated Union of Engineering Works (Engineering
                        Section)</em> [1973] ICR 620, who concluded at 626 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Once it is accepted that the High Court is concerned to exercise its power
                        of punishment for contempt in the public interest, as distinct from the
                        interests of the parties, <em>it seems to us that that court
                            must have inherent jurisdiction so to regulate its own procedure as best
                            to achieve this object</em>. The fact that the RSC do not so
                        provide is without significance for, in general, those rules are intended
                        for the guidance of litigants and their advisers and not for that of the
                        court itself. It would be otherwise if those rules in terms curbed the
                        court's freedom of action, but they do not in fact do so. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In 1974, in considering the question of
                    whether the waiver by an aggrieved party of a contempt signified the end of the
                    matter, the Phillimore Committee noted at para 171 that this did not reflect the
                    practice of the courts and strongly recommended that the position be clarified
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the court should have the power of its own motion to act against a
                        person who disobeys its order whenever it thinks fit to do so ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Indeed, s 7 of the UK Contempt of Court
                    Act 1981 expressly preserves the court’s inherent jurisdiction even though
                    it provides that proceedings for contempt of court under the strict liability
                    rule should not be instituted other than with the consent of the AG (see
                        <em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt</em>
                    at para 3-180).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In our judgment, on this issue, the position
                    is largely similar in Singapore. While we recognise that both the AG, in his
                    role as the Public Prosecutor and guardian of the public interest, and the party
                    aggrieved by the breach, have an interest in bringing proceedings for contempt,
                    in exercising its powers to punish for contempt, the court, in the final
                    analysis, acts within its inherent jurisdiction and on its own authority in the
                    administration of justice. This is a necessary corollary of the judicial power
                    that is vested in the court pursuant to Art 93 of the
                Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In exercising such powers, the court is not
                    seeking to vindicate its own dignity or the self-esteem of judges but to
                    safeguard the integrity of legal proceedings for the benefit of those seeking
                    recourse before the courts; and so, ultimately, for the benefit of the
                    public in whose interest it is that legal proceedings, civil or criminal,
                    should be fairly tried and justly determined (see <em>Pertamina
                        Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC and others</em> [2007] 2
                    SLR(R) 518 (“<em>Karaha Bodas</em>”) at
                    [23]). In the words of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in <em>Times
                        Newspapers</em> at 302:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In an ordered community courts are established for the pacific settlement
                        of disputes and for the maintenance of law and order. In the general
                        interests of the community it is imperative that the authority of the courts
                        should not be imperilled and that recourse to them should not be subject to
                        unjustifiable interference. <em>When such unjustifiable
                            interference is suppressed it is not because those charged with the
                            responsibilities of administering justice are concerned for their own
                            dignity: it is because the very structure of ordered life is at risk if
                            the recognised courts of the land are so flouted and their authority
                            wanes and is supplanted</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Thus, the court may not only allow a private
                    prosecution for criminal contempt to proceed despite the AG’s refusal to
                    prosecute, but it may even institute proceedings for criminal contempt on its
                    own motion, so long as the requisite procedural safeguards are
                satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In this case, SCM had not sought the views of
                    the AG before commencing committal proceedings against Aurol for criminal
                    contempt. It follows that the present proceedings are procedurally defective. Of
                    course, the court may exercise its discretion within its inherent jurisdiction
                    to cure such a procedural irregularity. For the reasons stated at [51] to [55]
                    above, where a party has failed to consult the AG before commencing criminal
                    contempt proceedings on its own accord, such discretion to regularise the
                    proceedings ought, as a general rule, only to be exercised sparingly, and only
                    for compelling reasons. An example of a compelling reason would be exceptional
                    urgency (see <em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt</em>
                    at para 3-181).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     No such exceptional circumstances exist in the
                    present case. Indeed the article in question was published almost two years ago
                    on 13 December 2010. However, we are also mindful of the fact that this
                    point has not previously been laid down by the Singapore courts and SCM’s
                    attention would not have been drawn to these considerations. We therefore
                    proceed to consider the appeal on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">
<em>Whether the terms of the interim sealing order
                    were ambiguous</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     We turn to the issue of whether the terms of
                    the interim sealing order were ambiguous and, if so, whether the Judge erred in
                    relying on extraneous circumstances including Drew’s letter of
                    6 December 2010 to dispel the ambiguity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Judge found that the purpose of the
                    interim sealing order was clear based on the surrounding facts and
                    circumstances. In particular, he found that “what is sought to be
                    protected by the interim order is the eventual ability of the court to decide
                    whether parties should be prevented from disclosing the information contained in
                    Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>
                    Affidavits, and the summons” (see [54] and [55] of the judgment
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Building on the Judge’s findings, SCM
                    argued that the Court’s purpose in granting the interim sealing order was
                    to preserve the <em>status quo</em>, <em>ie</em> to ensure that the public remained unaware of:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_i"></a>(i)     the fact that SCM had sought to seal
                        Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the fact that confidential
                        information was contained in Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup>
                        affidavit; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the manner in which such information could be deployed to the
                        detriment of SCM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     There is no doubt that since the essence of
                    criminal contempt is interference with the administration of justice, a party
                    who is not directly bound by an order of court may nonetheless be held liable
                    for criminal contempt if he acts to deliberately frustrate the purpose of that
                    order (see <em>Karaha Bodas</em> at [43]). However, as this
                    Court held in <em>Karaha Bodas</em> at [46]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the purpose of the court order concerned depends, in the main, on the
                        precise terms of that order itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     That the terms of the order form the essential
                    starting point makes eminently good sense. This is especially so in relation to
                    cases concerning a third party who is not directly bound by that order because
                    such a party would have no other point of reference from which to ascertain the
                    court’s purpose in having granted the order. As Lord Nicholls of
                    Birkenhead observed in <em>Attorney General v Punch Ltd and
                        Another</em> [2003] 1 AC 1046 at [43]–[46]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    ... It is for the court to decide whether the
                            plaintiff's asserted right needs and should have any, and if so what,
                            interim protection. If the court orders that pending the trial the
                            defendant shall not do certain acts the court thereby determines the
                            manner in which, in this respect, the proceedings shall be conducted.
                            This is the court's determination on what interim protection is needed
                            and is appropriate. Third parties are required to respect this
                            determination, as expressed in the court’s order. The reason why
                            the court grants interim protection is to protect the plaintiff’s
                            asserted right. <b><em>But the manner in which this
                                protection is afforded depends upon the terms of the interlocutory
                                injunction.</em></b> The purpose the court seeks to achieve by
                            granting the interlocutory injunction is that, pending a decision by the
                            court on the claims in the proceedings, the restrained acts shall not be
                            done. Third parties are in contempt of court if they wilfully interfere
                            with the administration of justice by thwarting the achievement of
                                <em>this</em> purpose in <em>those</em> proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    This is so, even if in the particular case, the
                            injunction is drawn in seemingly over-wide terms. The remedy of the
                            third party whose conduct is affected by the order is to apply to the
                            court for the order to be varied. Furthermore, there will be no contempt
                            unless the act done has some significant and adverse effect on the
                            administration of justice in the proceedings. This tempers the rigour of
                            the principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    Departure from this straightforward approach runs
                            into serious practical difficulties. <b><em>If, in this
                                context, the purpose of the court in granting an interlocutory
                                injunction means something other than the effect its terms show it
                                was intended to have between the parties, how is a third party to
                                know what it is? How is a third party to know what is the purpose,
                                which he must respect, if it is something other than the purpose
                                evident on the face of the order?</em></b> Uncertainty is bound to
                            follow, with consequential difficulties in proving that a third party
                            knowingly impeded or prejudiced the purpose the court sought to achieve
                            when granting the injunction. I see no justification or need to go down
                            this route, which is not supported by authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    This discussion does, of course, underline how
                            important it is for courts to seek to ensure that injunctions are not
                            drawn in wider terms than necessary. This is of particular importance
                            when the terms of the injunction may, in practice, affect the conduct of
                            third parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In other words, while the court will not go so
                    far as to demand absolute precision in the drafting of the terms of an order
                    before criminal contempt can be found, yet those terms must be sufficiently
                    certain such that a third party whose conduct is under scrutiny, would
                    reasonably be taken to be in a position to ascertain its purpose upon perusing
                    it. As Lord Oliver of Aylmerton noted in <em>Attorney General v
                        Times Newspapers Ltd and Another</em> [1992] 1 AC 191 (“the
                        <em>Spycatcher</em> case”) at 223F:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Where there is room for genuine doubt about what the court’s
                        purpose is, then the party charged with contempt is likely to escape
                        liability, not because of failure to prove the actus reus but for want of
                        the necessary mens rea, for an intention to frustrate the purpose of the
                        court would be difficult to establish if the purpose itself was not either
                        known or obvious. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It follows that the starting point for the
                    inquiry in the present case would be the terms of the interim sealing order in
                    order to ascertain whether that gives a clear indication as to what the
                    AR’s purpose was in granting the order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As previously noted, the order was issued by
                    the AR on the backing page of SUM 5659; it was never extracted by either
                    party in accordance with the usual procedure. Accordingly, the annotations made
                    by the AR on the backing page constitute the only reference point for
                    determining what the terms of the order are. For ease of reference, we set out
                    the AR’s annotations again:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Bernette Meyer and Mr Issac Lum for Pf</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">PC: Application is for the sealing of an affidavit that my client has

                        asked for consent to the sealing last week but did not receive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ct: Application fixed for Friday 10 December 2010 on the usual OS SUMS

                        the Suit. To serve on all parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It is undisputed that the AR was mistaken when
                    she referred to Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit dated
                    26 November 2010: Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit was
                    dated 3 December 2010 and it was Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit that was dated 26 November 2010.
                        <em>Prima facie</em>, this gives rise to some ambiguity
                    as to whether the AR intended to seal Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit or his
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit. The question then is whether by
                    looking at the AR’s annotations as a whole it is possible to resolve this
                    ambiguity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     According to the AR’s annotations of
                    what transpired during the hearing, Ms Meyer had first described the nature of
                    her application under SUM 5659 as being “for the sealing of an affidavit
                    that my client has filed <em>before</em>, on 26 Nov
                    2010”, <em>ie</em> Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit, as well as any other affidavits
                    filed in the suit which refers to exhibit WWS-47 in Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit. At no point does it appear that Ms
                    Meyer mentioned Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit. It was
                    then further noted by the AR that Ms Meyer had asked that “in the
                    interim, before that hearing, for <em>this</em> affidavit
                    to be sealed such that non-parties to the suit cannot inspect the
                    affidavit.” On a plain reading, the reference to <em>this</em> affidavit appears to be a reference to the affidavit that
                    had been referred to in the first sentence, <em>ie</em>
                    Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Against this, however, it was contended by SCM
                    that the AR’s subsequent use of the words “<em>supporting</em> affidavit” (emphasis added) suggests that she
                    intended to seal Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit.
                    Reference was made by SCM to Prayer 1 of SUM 5659 which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">that the file relating to this Summons and all its contents including the
                        supporting affidavit be sealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     According to SCM, since “supporting
                    affidavit” in Prayer 1 of SUM 5659 referred to the
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit, the AR must similarly have been
                    referring to the 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit in her order. However,
                    we note that in the very same sentence, the AR had referenced 26 November
                    2010 as the date of the affidavit she evidently intended to seal and this is the
                    date on which the 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit was filed. This
                    suggests that the AR might have been looking at the
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit while drafting her order (which
                    seems to be the only or at least most plausible explanation for how and why she
                    referenced the date).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In our view, the most that can be said about
                    the terms of the interim sealing order, on its face, is that it was and remains
                    ambiguous as to which affidavit the AR was referring to. Indeed, the Judge below
                    acknowledged as much at [44] and [55] of the judgment. However, the Judge relied
                    on the surrounding facts and circumstances, and in particular, Drew’s
                    letter of 6 December 2010 and on this basis went on to conclude that the
                    ambiguity had been sufficiently dispelled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As noted above at [9], SCM’s solicitors
                    had written to Straits Law, the solicitors for the defendants in Suit 351 on
                    6 December 2010, informing them that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the Court has granted an interim order that until the hearing of the
                        Summons, the Summons itself and the 5<sup>th</sup> Affidavit
                        of Mr Wong Weng Sun ... be sealed ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Judge found that this letter, to which
                    Aurol’s attention had been drawn, was sufficient to dispel any ambiguity
                    in the order itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     With respect, we consider that in making this
                    finding the Judge fell into error. Drew’s letter of 6 December 2010
                    could not possibly have clarified any ambiguity that was inherent in the
                    AR’s order. At its highest, the letter could only have set out
                    Drew’s understanding of the order, though even then it is noteworthy that
                    neither Ms Meyer nor Mr Lum, who were the attending lawyers before the AR filed
                    an affidavit deposing to their understanding of the terms of the interim sealing
                    order. But the key point is that Drew’s subjective interpretation of the
                    meaning of the interim sealing order could not and should not have had any
                    bearing in determining what the AR’s decision and her purpose in making
                    the order had been. Indeed, given that the terms of the interim sealing order
                    were ambiguous, it is not unlikely that the lawyers concerned could themselves
                    have misinterpreted the order. Put simply, Drew’s letter of 6 December
                    2010 might reveal what the lawyers from Drew believed; and also what they
                    conveyed to Straits Law; even what was conveyed to Aurol by Straits Law; and
                    even what Aurol believed. But it can shed no light on what the AR intended or
                    what her purpose had been in making the order and unless that is clear beyond
                    any reasonable doubt the conviction cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The note of Ms Meyer’s appearance
                    suggests that during the hearing, mention was made of sealing one affidavit
                    only. According to SCM, Ms Meyer had asked for an interim sealing order
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the summons and Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit, but not Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit. This does not seem entirely
                    logical to us because it was the latter, and only the latter, which contained
                    the confidential information about the SCM Group’s foreign exchange
                    hedging policies. We asked Mr Singh during oral arguments what interest SCM
                    would have had in sealing Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit.
                    Mr Singh replied that Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit
                    explained in detail how information in Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit could be used to SCM’s
                    detriment. According to him, without Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit, no one would have known of the significance of Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     This may be so, but, Mr Singh did not go as
                    far as to say that the 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit itself contains
                    confidential information. Moreover, if we accept his response at face value,
                    then it would seem the sealing application was superfluous since until
                    Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit had been filed, the
                    information contained in Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit
                    would have remained in the file without attracting any attention. In our view,
                    this seems unlikely if not untenable. Ultimately, Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit is <em>descriptive</em> in nature in that it merely <em>describes</em> in a general sense what type of confidential
                    information is contained in the 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit and how
                    it could be used to SCM’s detriment; it does not itself contain the
                    confidential information that SCM really wanted to protect. On balance, our view
                    is that if SCM was seeking protection at that stage for only one affidavit, it
                    was more likely than not to have been Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In addition, according to Aurol’s
                    affidavit filed on 18 July 2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> (“Aurol’s

                    1 December 2010 between Ms Valerie Ang of Straits Law, who was one of the
                    solicitors for the defendants in Suit 351, and Ms Meyer, Ms Meyer had asked Ms
                    Ang for PPLH’s consent to seal Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit. Ms Ang was unable to obtain instructions to consent. As a result, SCM
                    then filed SUM 5659 on 6 December 2010. This is further corroborated
                    by the AR’s annotations, where the AR recorded Ms Meyer as saying
                    “We asked for consent to the sealing last week but did not
                    receive”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     It is also corroborated by a letter sent by
                    Straits Law to Drew on 16 December 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> This was a letter from Straits Law stating that
                    while they were happy to agree to a sealing order, the sealing order ought to be
                    limited in scope to the confidential portions of Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit. For present purposes, the
                    following statements by Straits Law in the letter bear highlighting:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our clients note that your client’s position on sealing has been
                        modified and clarified since your initial request made over the telephone on
                        1 December 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During that telephone conversation, your Bernette Meyer had explained that
                            <em>your client wanted your reply affidavit and any
                            response from our clients to the reply affidavit referring to any
                            documents in the reply affidavit to be sealed on the ground that it
                            contained confidential information or information not publicly
                            available, such as PPL Shipyard’s minutes of
                        meetings.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The fact that all the surrounding references
                    to sealing appear to have been to Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit was yet another factor suggesting that this was the affidavit that was
                    the subject of the interim sealing order; but the position is not clear because
                    of the other references to the “5<sup>th</sup> supporting
                    affidavit” in the note of the order itself. On the whole, the interim
                    sealing order was ambiguous in our view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The Judge did also state at [41] of the
                    judgment below as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whatever else Mr Aurol says about the mistaken reference to the number of
                        the affidavit and the date ascribed to it, he cannot deny that the interim
                        sealing order in relation to Summons 5659 was clear and
                        unambiguous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     At para 37 of Aurol’s 18 July 2011
                    affidavit, Aurol offered this explanation in relation to the disclosure of SUM
                    5659:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I never had any intention of breaching the Interim Order or thwarting or
                        frustrating its purpose. With regard to the summons, I did not realise it
                        had been sealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is evident that Aurol’s explanation
                    in relation to the summons itself is a bald statement that admits the breach but
                    asserts an absence of deliberate intent. It cannot possibly exculpate him.
                    However, we think that Lord Reid’s admonition in <em>Times
                        Newspapers</em> at 298–299 is apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think the true view is that expressed by Lord Parker C.J. in <em>Reg. v Duffy, Ex parte Nash</em> [1960] 2 Q.B. 188, 200,
                        that there must be “a real risk, as opposed to a remote
                        possibility.”That is an application of the ordinary <em>de minimis</em> principle. There is no contempt if the
                        possibility of influence is remote. If there is some but only a small
                        likelihood, that may influence the court to refrain from inflicting any
                        punishment. If there is a serious risk some action may be necessary.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The foregoing words of Lord Reid were cited
                    with approval by this Court in <em>Shadrake Alan v
                        Attorney-General</em> [2011] 3 SLR 778, where it was
                    held at [30] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would add that, <em>even if</em> the
                        Judge had indeed held the view that “a small likelihood” of
                        risk constituted a real risk (a view which we disagree with for the reason
                        stated in [28] above), such a “small likelihood” of
                        risk would merely be a “technical” contempt that may not even
                        attract any sanction at all (see Lord Reid's view in <em>Times Newspapers</em> at 299, and also <em>Shadrake</em> 1 at [77]). Such a situation would be a highly
                        borderline or marginal case of contempt and, viewed from the perspective of
                        substance and even practical principle, might not even merit
                        the initiation of contempt proceedings by the Respondent in the
                        first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In both cases, it was made clear that if the
                    nature of the contempt was such that there is no real likelihood that any risk
                    to the public interest would materialise, the court will be slow to inflict
                    punishment. In the present case, we think it not irrelevant as has been observed
                    at [85]–[88] above, that it was only Wong’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit, and not Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit nor the summons itself, which
                    contained the confidential information that SCM was seeking to protect. This,
                    coupled with the ambiguity in the interim sealing order as to whether it was
                    Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit or Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit that had been sealed, militates
                    against the Court inflicting punishment for the breach constituted solely in
                    relation to the disclosure of the summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The Judge also placed some emphasis on
                    Aurol’s background and commercial experience and his knowledge of the
                    circumstances of the case in the light of which he concluded that Aurol would
                    have known what the AR’s order was directed at. With respect, we fail to
                    see how Aurol’s background as an experienced businessman, even one with a
                    law degree, could have shed light on what the true purpose and intent of the AR
                    in making the order had been.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In our judgment, the Judge focused on
                    Aurol’s actions which showed a disregard for and a reprehensible
                    indifference to what the Court’s purposes may have been. The Judge was
                    also mindful of the fact that given the acrimonious circumstances prevailing in
                    the context of the disputes between SCM and Aurol’s principals as well as
                    Aurol’s personal involvement in those disputes, he had every motive to do
                    what he could to undermine SCM’s endeavour to rectify the situation after
                    they had put themselves in the prejudicial position of potentially having
                    released important confidential information into the public domain. We do not
                    disagree with the Judge on those conclusions. But Aurol’s dishonourable
                    intentions and even his acting upon those intentions do not constitute a crime
                    if there is a reasonable doubt as to what the real purpose of the order was. The
                    fact of the matter is that on the face of the interim sealing order there
                    remains some room for reasonable doubt as to what its precise purpose was. Given
                    that we are dealing with proceedings for criminal contempt for which the
                    standard of proof is the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,
                    this ambiguity ought to be resolved in Aurol’s favour. To use the words of
                    Lord Denning MR in <em>In re Bramblevale Ltd</em>
                    [1970] Ch 128 at 137:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A contempt of court is an offence of a criminal character. A man may be
                        sent to prison for it. It must be satisfactorily proved. To use the
                        time-honoured phrase, it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In our judgment this is true in relation to
                    each element of the offence. Here the offence lies in frustrating the purpose of
                    the order in question and that purpose must specifically be proven. Accordingly,
                    we find that in respect of his disclosure of Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit, Aurol ought not to have been found
                    guilty of criminal contempt. As to his disclosure of the summons, this was
                    technically a violation but we do not think this alone would carry a real risk
                    of interference with the administration of justice. We therefore allow
                    Aurol’s appeal on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the offence of criminal contempt could be made out in the
                circumstances even though the order was a sealing order and not an express
                non-disclosure order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The foregoing conclusion suffices for the
                    purposes of allowing the appeal. However, it is important that we also address
                    Aurol’s argument that an interim sealing order merely prevents the
                    inspection of sealed documents from the court file and has no relevance where a
                    person who has possession of the sealed material discloses it to others.
                    According to Aurol, an interim sealing order does not prevent such disclosure,
                    even by publication of the sealed documents, because this would not entail the
                    inspection of the court file. According to Aurol, this follows from the fact
                    that a sealing order is distinct from a specific non-disclosure
                order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In our view, this contention is flawed. In
                    proceedings for criminal contempt, the court will not adopt a myopic and
                    blinkered view of the scope of an order. It is ultimately the <em>purpose</em> for which the order was granted that will be the
                    lodestar in guiding the court’s determination as to the true <em>effect</em> of the order. As Mr Singh submitted, it is
                    precisely for this reason that in the <em>Spycatcher</em>
                    case at 231B, the Court held that a third party, who was neither named in the
                    injunction nor had assisted a named party to breach the order, could
                    nevertheless be found guilty of contempt where he knowingly acted so as to
                    frustrate the purpose of the order. Thus, while the injunctions granted by
                    Millett J in the <em>Spycatcher</em> case appeared, on
                    their face, to be only directed at the parties named in the order, the Court
                    adopted a purposive approach and found that the <em>effect</em> of the order was also to prevent third parties such as
                    the defendant from undermining the order by publishing the materials which were
                    covered by the injunctions. In doing so, the Court (per Lord Oliver of
                    Aylmerton) found at 223E to 224A that there was no doubt that the purpose of the
                    injunction “was to preserve, until the trial of the action, the
                    plaintiff’s right to keep confidential and unpublished” the said
                    materials.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In the same vein, in <em>Seaward</em> (referred to above at [60] and cited by this Court in
                        <em>Karaha Bodas</em> at [42]), Lindley LJ
                    observed at 555–556 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A motion to commit a man for breach of an injunction, which is
                        technically wrong unless he is bound by the injunction, is one thing; and a
                        motion to commit a man for contempt of Court, not because he is bound by the
                        injunction by being a party to the cause, but because he is conducting
                        himself so as to obstruct the course of justice, is another and a totally
                        different thing. The difference is very marked. In the one case the party
                        who is bound by the injunction is proceeded against for the purpose of
                        enforcing the order of the Court for the benefit of the person who got it.
                        In the other case <em>the Court will not allow its process to
                            be set at naught and treated with contempt</em>. ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    This is the same distinction we have already
                    alluded to at [29] above. While in a narrow sense, the effect of granting the
                    interim sealing order was that it prevented an individual from inspecting the
                    sealed documents, it was evident that the AR had intended that the public should
                    not have access to the confidential information contained in the sealed
                    documents through any other means. To find otherwise would mean that a party to
                    the proceedings who might routinely have obtained copies of the sealed materials
                    as well as a non-party who somehow obtained possession of them could, with
                    impunity, have disclosed the confidential information to the public in spite of
                    the interim sealing order. This would not only denude the interim sealing order
                    of all meaning and effect, but would also allow one, in the words of
                    Lindley LJ, to “set the court’s process at naught”. By
                    any measure, it would be perverse if such conduct were not also caught within
                    the ambit of the offence of criminal contempt provided each element had been
                    satisfactorily proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In the present case, but for the fact that
                    we have found some ambiguity as to whether the interim sealing order was
                    directed at Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit or
                    Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit, we would quite readily
                    have found Aurol’s actions to have undermined and subverted the AR’s
                    purpose in granting the order. Indeed Aurol had clearly undermined the purpose
                    of the interim sealing order insofar as the summons itself was concerned, though
                    we have found that this was a “technical” violation. Given that
                    the gravamen of the offence is the intentional impedance of the Court’s
                    purpose, we would not have accepted the argument that there was no contempt here
                    simply because the interim sealing order <em>prima
                        facie</em> only prevented inspection of the sealed documents in the
                    court’s file. There is no doubt that the disclosure of confidential
                    information contained in the sealed documents had it been done to thwart or
                    frustrate the purpose of the order would have amounted to criminal
                    contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    We have allowed the appeal and now turn to
                    the question of costs. The power to award costs is fundamentally and essentially
                    one that is discretionary. Even though the general principle is for costs to
                    follow the event, the overriding concern of the court must be to exercise its
                    discretion to achieve the fairest allocation of costs (see <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler SC
                    gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 59/3/2, <em>Soon
                        Peng Yam and another (trustees of the Chinese Swimming Club) v Maimon bte
                        Ahmad</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 279 and <em>Ng Eng Ghee and
                        others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd,
                        intervener) and another appeal</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R)
                155).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The court has a very wide discretion in
                    determining what the fairest allocation of costs is and in this regard it is not
                    confined to considering the particular outcome of the litigation. In <em>Lee Seng Choon Ronnie v Singapore Island Country Club</em>
                    [1993] 1 SLR(R) 557 (“<em>Ronnie Lee</em>”),
                    the appellant succeeded in his appeal and was found to be entitled to a
                    declaration that the decision to delete his name from the register of members of
                    the club was null and void and that he remained at all times a member.
                    Nonetheless, he was denied the costs of the appeal as well as the costs below.
                    The Court in <em>Ronnie Lee</em> explained at [31] and [32]
                    that, in doing so, it was reflecting its disapproval of the appellant’s
                    conduct in failing to pay relatively small amounts of his club’s bills
                    under the pretext of frequently travelling abroad or the unauthorised signing of
                    chits by his son, which the Court said was inexcusable and revealed a cavalier
                    attitude and disregard of the club’s rules. The Court further observed at
                    [31] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">His [the appellant’s] denial of having received the notices sent to
                        him by the club and yet being able to produce to the court the third and
                        final reminder [effectively the second notice under r 47(e)] claiming it was
                        a file copy obtained for him by an unnamed friend, when the club did not
                        keep copies of the second and subsequent reminders, was deplorable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    It seems to us that Aurol’s conduct in
                    emailing SUM 5659 and Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit
                    to Raj is equally deserving of this Court’s opprobrium. Aurol revealed a
                    reprehensible disregard for the Court and a manifest willingness to undermine a
                    litigant’s right to avail itself of the Court’s processes. In the
                    present case, it is undisputed that copies of SUM5659, the interim order,
                    Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit and Drew’s letter
                    6 December 2010 had been sent to Aurol on or before 9 December
                        2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> It is also undisputed that Aurol
                    had read these documents before his conversation with Raj. At paras 25, 28 and
                    29 of Aurol’s 18<sup>th</sup> July 2010 affidavit, he
                    deposed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    On 9 December 2010, I was reading the backing sheet
                            of Summons No. 5659/2010M, which contained the interim order, when I
                            received a telephone call from Mr Conrad Jayaraj
                            (“Conrad”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    In the course of our conversation, I mentioned the
                            application by the Applicant in Summons No. 5659/2010M.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    
              <em>I told Conrad about the
                                application because there was a comment at Paragraph 21 of Wong Weng
                                Sun’s 5th Affidavit of 3 Dec 2010 about journalists which I
                                thought would interest him.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Specifically, in relation to Drew’s
                    letter of 6 December 2010, at para 34 of Aurol’s
                        18<sup>th</sup><sup> </sup>July 2010
                        affidavit,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> he deposed to the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Drew &amp; Napier LLC has referred to the contents of their letter of 6
                        December 2010 to Straits Law Practice LLC, but this letter was not within my
                        contemplation when I spoke to Conrad on 9 December 2010. <em>I received this letter, but had not read it in
                            detail.</em> All along, I acted under the belief that it was the
                            4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit of Wong Weng Sun which the
                        Applicant had sought to seal.[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Thus, Aurol’s position was that he
                    received the letter but “had not read it in detail”. However, as
                    the Judge pointed out at [62] of the judgment below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Nowhere does he explain what he understood that letter to mean, or
                        otherwise explains why, having read it, he thought it was irrelevant or
                        forgot all about it. The letter was a short one-page, three-paragraph,
                        straightforward letter; there was nothing complex about its contents and it
                        involved an application which the Defendants [in Suit 351] had to decide
                        whether to contest or agree to. Why the contents of that important letter
                        were not in his contemplation when he spoke to Mr Raj is also not explained
                        nor elaborated upon. I do not even categorise that as an explanation,
                        because I read this as a bald and evasive statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Indeed, given that Aurol had read the
                    summons, the interim order and Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit in enough detail for him to even be aware of what para 21 of
                    Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit said about journalists, it
                    is inconceivable that he would not also have read Drew’s letter of
                    6 December 2010 with equal attention. That letter directly contradicted his
                    supposed belief that it was Wong’s 4<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit that had been sealed. Likewise, the use of the words
                        “5<sup>th</sup> supporting affidavit” in the
                    interim sealing order ought, at least, to have given him cause for pause. While
                    these factors do not resolve the ambiguity that was inherent in the order and so
                    do not establish just what the AR’s intention had been, they do shed light
                    on Aurol’s attitude and his intentions and more specifically his wanton
                    disregard for the due processes of the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The only proper thing for Aurol to have done
                    in these circumstances would have been to clarify the proper ambit of the order
                    before emailing SUM 5659 and Wong’s 5<sup>th</sup>
                    affidavit to Raj on 10 December 2010. He did not do this and his actions,
                    though not amounting to a crime, reveal a reprehensible disregard for the Court
                    and for the order that had been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The circumstances before and after the
                    publication of the Today article also reveal the lack of probity in
                    Aurol’s conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Aurol claimed that he did not ask Raj to
                    keep his identity confidential when he sent him the summons and Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> Affidavit. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> This was contradicted by
                    Raj’s affidavit filed on 23 February 2011 in OS 74 of 2011 (at
                    para 27), in which Raj deposed to the contrary. The fact that Mediacorp resisted
                    the disclosure of the source sought by SCM in OS 74 of 2011, both before
                    the AR and the High Court, lends credence to Raj’s version of the
                    events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In any event, the matter might have been
                    clarified if Aurol had simply disclosed the email he sent to Raj. However, Aurol
                    claimed he was unable to do so as he had supposedly deleted the email from his
                    computer, and was unable to retrieve it from the internet service
                    provider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Aurol’s disclosure of the information
                    to Raj, who was not only a journalist but one who had earlier written an article
                    in Today about the on-going dispute in Suit 351, adds to the dark cloud
                    that hangs over Aurol’s conduct. In particular, it may be noted that Aurol
                    had specifically drawn Raj’s attention to para 21 of Wong’s
                        5<sup>th</sup> affidavit, which explicitly states that one
                    of the reasons for the sealing order was the high possibility that journalists
                    might seek to examine the affidavits to find material for news articles. The
                    Judge had likened this to “waving a red cloth in front of a bull and
                    expecting it to ignore the instigation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Aurol’s furtive conduct throughout the
                    entire episode also belies his claim that his disclosure to Raj was entirely
                    innocuous. By a letter dated 14 December 2010 from Drew to Mediacorp, Drew
                    had requested Mediacorp to reveal the source of the leak of information to Raj.
                    If Aurol’s claim that he and Raj were old friends is to be believed, Raj
                    must have told Aurol about Drew’s request. However, Aurol chose not to
                    come forward. It was only after SCM filed proceedings against Mediacorp seeking
                    disclosure of the source and after the AR’s decision on 7 March 2011
                    ordering Mediacorp to reveal the source had been upheld on appeal by the High
                    Court on 31 March 2011 and another Today Article had been published on
                    2 April 2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>, stating that Mediacorp
                    had been ordered to disclose the identity of the source, that Aurol finally
                    surfaced on 6 April 2011 to reveal himself as the source and apologise
                    “for breaching the interim order” (see [16] above). If his apology
                    is to be taken at face value as a sincere expression of his contrition, then it
                    appears that Aurol evidently believed his actions had been in breach of the
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    For all these reasons, although we allow
                    Aurol’s appeal we register our disapproval of his conduct by not awarding
                    him the costs of the appeal. Each party will bear its own costs of the appeal.
                    We also do not disturb the order of costs that was made by the Judge in favour
                    of SCM in the proceedings below.</p>
