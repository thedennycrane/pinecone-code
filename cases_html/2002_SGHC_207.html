<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The plaintiff bankers

oversight on the part of the plaintiffs’ loan recovery department, this receipt was

not communicated to the plaintiffs’ solicitors when he appeared in court to argue the

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The issue</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1

        The issue for determination in this

registrar’s appeal was whether the court has the jurisdiction to amend a judgment

entered in favour of the plaintiffs, for an amount in excess of what was in fact due, upon

the application of the plaintiffs themselves, owing to an admitted accidental error on

their part.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brief facts</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The circumstances which gave rise to this

appeal were as follows. The plaintiff bankers brought an action against the defendant for

a sum of US$416,049.11 and interest owing to them, upon recall of facilities granted to

the defendant. After appearance had been entered, the plaintiffs applied to the court for

summary judgment on the ground that the defendant had no defence to the plaintiffs’

claim. The application was heard by the assistant registrar on 15 February 2002; judgment

was entered for the amount claimed and there was no appeal against that decision.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        The matter did not, however, end there. It

would seem that after the plaintiffs had applied to the court on 8 January 2002 for

summary judgment but before it was heard on 15 February 2002, the defendant remitted to

the plaintiffs a sum of US$50,000. Due to an oversight on the part of the plaintiffs’

loan recovery department, this latest receipt was not communicated to the plaintiffs’

solicitors when the latter appeared in court to argue the summary judgment application.

The defendant’s counsel, who was also present at the hearing, did not bring to the

attention of the court of the latest payment. The upshot was that judgment entered on 15

February 2002 in favour of the plaintiffs was in excess of US$50,000 actually due and

owing as of 15 February 2002. It must be presently observed, however, that on the date

when the plaintiffs applied to the court ie on 8 January 2002 for summary judgment, the

claimed amount was correct.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        Admitting their oversight, the plaintiffs

applied to the court to amend the judgment to reflect the correct amount due and owing as

of 15 February 2002 from the defendant. The plaintiffs’ assistant vice president and

head of the loan recovery department averred in his supporting affidavit that the slip was

due to an oversight on the part of his department; the present application for an

amendment was to reflect the actual amount due from the defendant currently; and that the

proposed amendment was to the benefit and advantage rather than to the detriment or

prejudice of the defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        It is perhaps relevant at this stage to mention

that, in the meantime, the defendant also applied to the court to set aside the judgment

so entered and to stay the action, not on account of the irregularity based on the excess

sum, but on other grounds which need not be particularised here. The deputy registrar,

having heard arguments on 14 June 2002, found the application of the defendant to be

unmeritorious and dismissed it. There was no further appeal on this matter from the

defendant. The deputy registrar also, on the same date, disallowed the plaintiffs’

application to amend the judgment. His minutes read: ‘O 20, r 11 is

inapplicable.’</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Appeal: Arguments and conclusion</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        On appeal, it was contended on behalf of the

plaintiff-appellants that the judgment entered was overstated by US$50,000 due to a

clerical error and the court had the requisite powers and jurisdiction to amend it under O

20 r 11 of the Rules of Court which provides: ‘Clerical mistakes in judgment or

orders, or errors arising therein from any accidental slip or omission, may at any time be

corrected by the court by summons without an appeal.’ Reliance was also based by

counsel on a Singapore High Court decision (per Thean J) in <i><b>Philip Securities (Pte)

v Yong Tet Miaw</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=3600&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1988] 3 MLJ 61</a> which was followed in Malaysia in <i><b>Lau Ming

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        In <i><b>Philip Securities</b></i>, the

defendant applied to court to set aside a judgment in default of defence obtained by the

plaintiffs contending that the judgment was signed for a sum greater than what was due to

the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, being alerted of the irregularity in the judgment entered,

applied for an amendment to the judgment sum. Both applications were heard by the

registrar, who, after disallowing the defendant’s application to set aside the

judgment, allowed the plaintiffs’ application to amend the judgment. The defendant

appealed to the High Court against the decision of the registrar.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        In upholding the decision of the registrar,

Thean J said at page 62:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    In my opinion, the learned registrar was plainly right in his decision. Where a judgment

    has been entered in default of defence for an amount in excess of that which is due, the

    court has jurisdiction to amend the judgment instead of setting it aside. Order 19 r 9

    empowers the court to set aside or vary a judgment entered in default of pleadings, such

    as the judgment here, on such terms as the court thinks fit. In this case, the plaintiffs

    had inadvertently entered judgment for the whole amount claimed without giving credit for

    the sum of $6,328.44 representing the net proceeds from the sale of the shares received by

    the plaintiffs for the account of the defendant. In these circumstances, the learned

    registrar was entitled under this rule to amend the judgment by reducing the amount to

    $292,450.81.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        Thean J further commented at page 62:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    It was argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, and I fully agreed that the amendment made by

    the learned registrar could also be supported and justified under O 20 r 11, and counsel

    cited in support <i>Armitage</i> v <i>Parsons</i>. In that case, a judgment was signed in

    default of appearance and due to an error the amount included in the judgment for costs

    exceeded by a few shillings the amount properly allowable for costs. The defendant applied

    to set aside the judgment on the ground of irregularity. On hearing the application, the

    district registrar refused to set it aside but amended it by reducing the amount

    accordingly. On appeal, the judge affirmed his order. On further appeal, the Court of

    Appeal dismissed it. In his judgment, Sir Gorell Barnes, President, said at p 415:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In my opinion, O XXVIII r 11,

      which provided that ‘clerical mistakes in judgments or orders, or errors arising

      therein from any accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the court or

      a judge on motion or summons without an appeal’ enables us to deal with this case so

      as to do substantial justice.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Later, in conclusion, he said, at

    p 417:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To my mind it is clear, as a

      matter of good sense and justice, that this was an accidental slip which under O XXVIII r

      1 ought to be corrected, and that the whole judgment should not be set aside because of a

      mistake to the insignificant amount of 12s. I do not think that by so amending the

      judgment any of the rules or any principle of law is infringed. For these reasons I think

      that the appeal should be dismissed.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Very recently, the Court of

    Appeal in England in the case of <i>Navimprex Centrala Navala </i>v <i>George Moundreas

    &amp; Co SA</i> held that under O 20 r 11 of the Rules of Supreme Court (which is in pari

    materia with O 20 r 11 here), the court had jurisdiction to correct mistake in the

    judgment which had arisen out of an accidental slip or omission made by the plaintiffs or

    their advisers. In that case, judgment in default entered against the defendants contained

    an error caused by the failure of the plaintiffs or their solicitors to inform the court

    of the two items of the claim totalling $63,400, which should have been excluded, and in

    consequence, the judgment sum exceeded the amount to which the plaintiffs were entitled.

    The defendants applied to have the judgment set aside and the plaintiffs applied to have

    it amended so as to exclude the two items and to reduce the judgment sum accordingly.

    Mustill J (as he then was) amended the judgment, which was for an amount of over

    $1,000,000, by reducing it by a sum of $63,400 under O 20 r 11. His decision was affirmed

    on appeal by the Court of Appeal.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        The principles stated by Thean J was followed

in <i><b>Lau Ming Hing Richard</b></i>. In that case <i><b>Chong Siew Fai J</b></i>

observed at page 332 (<i>supra</i>):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In this regard, I venture to

    observe that the modern tendency of the courts seems to lean in favour of allowing

    amendment of a judgment debt to a lesser sum in cases of accidental slip or omission

    rather than setting aside the whole sum, where justice permits the former course to be

    adopted. See <i>Navimprex Centrala Navala v George Moundreas &amp; Co SA</i>, showing that

    the power to correct clerical mistakes was extended to those made by a party or his

    advisers. See also <i>Philip Securities (Pte) v Yong Tet Miaw</i>. It may be noted that in

    those cases cited, the judgments were entered in default. In our instant case the order or

    judgment was entered by consent of the parties and hence is a stronger case for amendment.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        It was contended by plaintiffs’ counsel

that the decision of the deputy registrar was against the comments and rulings made by

Thean J in <i><b>Philip Securities</b></i>. The issue before me revolved mainly around the

construction of O 20 r 11 of the Rules of Court, and as to the court’s powers and

jurisdiction to amend the judgment entered for an amount in excess of sum actually due and

owing due to an error.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        Dealing with the scope and ambit of O 20 r 11

of the Rules of Court, the authors of <i><b>Halsbury’s Laws of England</b></i>

(reissue, 4<sup>th</sup> Edn) at para 279 comment:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    … The court has power, on summons or motion and without an appeal, at any time to

    correct clerical mistakes in judgments or orders or errors arising in them from any

    accidental slip or omission. <i>What gives the court jurisdiction under this provision is

    that the slip or omission was accidental, and not due to a mistake or error of the court

    or a party or any misunderstanding</i>. The court may decline to correct its order or

    judgment under this provision, but undue delay is not itself a ground for doing so.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">       

    In addition to this provision the court has an inherent jurisdiction to correct its own

    orders so as to give effect to its intention and to make its meaning plain. [Emphasis

    added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        On the same subject, Prof Pinsler in his book <i><b>Civil

Procedure</b></i> says at page 727:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">… After the judgment or

    order is perfected, amendments may only be made in relation to ‘clerical

    errors’, ‘accidental slips’ and ‘omissions’ (such as those which

    occur in the drawing up the judgment or order). The court also has the inherent power to

    correct errors to give clear expression to its intention in the judgment or order. The

    rationale is that the court is entitled to correct the record to make it consistent with

    the judgment or order which it obviously meant to pronounce. This is a matter of

    discretion which the court will not necessarily exercise if there is a likelihood that

    injustice might be caused thereby. The court has no power to correct substantive errors

    concerning the decision itself (ie ‘a mistake of its own in law or otherwise’)

    even if they are apparent on the face of the order. In these circumstances, the remedy

    would lie in the appeal process. …</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        Reverting to the appeal at hand, the facts in

this case were not dissimilar to that in either <i><b>Philip Securities</b></i> or the

English Court of Appeal decision in <i><b>Navimprex Centrala Navala v George Moundreas

&amp; Co SA</b></i> (1983) 127 Sol J 392 (per Ackner and Oliver LJJ, as they then were)

referred to with approval by Thean J in <i><b>Philip Securities</b></i>. I reaffirm the

principles stated in both cases<i><b> </b></i>and say<i><b> </b></i>that the court is

empowered under O 20 r 11 to amend a judgment entered, when it is established to its

satisfaction that the slip or omission was accidental, as was the case herein, provided of

course that such an amendment was not to the disadvantage of the other party which in this

case was not even opposing the application.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        Furthermore, I am of the view that para 14 to

the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act provides that the High Court

shall have the ‘powers to grant all reliefs and remedies at law and in equity’.

These additional powers conferred on the High Court are an useful adjunct which the court

may draw upon as necessary when it is just or equitable to do so. These powers are to be

exercised with utmost care to right wrongs and to offer redress to applicants with

promptitude particularly when circumstances make it plain that resiling from the exercise

of such powers would yield nothing but hardship and delay and profit none. In the case at

hand, the plaintiffs’ explanation that the error was occasioned by an accidental

lapse in communication, not at the time the claim was presented, but later when the

application was in train, and that they had moved swiftly to rectify the error to the

advantage of the defendant, appeared to have considerable merit.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        In the premises, for the reasons appearing

herein, I allowed the plaintiff’s appeal to amend the judgment so entered with no

objection from the defendant.</font></p>
