<p xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040">GROUNDS OF DECISION</font></strong></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">1. On 5 April 2002, I gave judgment in favour of the

plaintiffs in respect of their claim against the defendants for damages arising out of the negligent

repair of the engine of the plaintiffs vessel <i>Nur Marina</i>. The parties subsequently

appeared before me on the issue of quantum and this supplemental judgment relates to those

arguments.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">2. In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs claimed the following

as damages:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(1) repair costs in the sum of $628,277.25;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(2) expenses incurred being:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(i) $2,543 for survey fees and investigations;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(ii) $28,000 for towing costs;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(iii) RM40,099 for additional wages and other expenses;</font></p>
<font size="4">
</font></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(3) loss of profits while the vessel was being

    repaired.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">At the start of the trial the plaintiffs dropped their

  claim for loss of profits. I therefore have to deal only with items (1) and (2).</font></p>
<b xmlns=""><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">Expenses</font></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">3. I will deal first with the claim for expenses. The first item,

the sum of $2,543, was an amount paid to the Salvage Association for inspecting the vessel and

carrying out investigations to ascertain the nature and cause of the damage to the engine. The

Salvage Association was appointed to carry out this work by the vessels insurers. The plaintiffs

did not appoint it. The insurers were interested in ascertaining the cause of the damage so that

they could determine whether the loss was covered by their policy of insurance. In my judgment, this

amount was not an expense incurred by the plaintiffs as a result of the damage and therefore they

cannot claim it from the defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4. The second item, the towage costs of $28,000 was, on the other

hand, a direct result of the damage to the engine. The engine was so badly damaged that the vessel

could not sail under its own steam from Kuantan, the port of refuge, to Singapore for permanent

repairs to the engine. It had to be towed here and the plaintiffs had no choice but to incur the

towage expenses. They are entitled to recover the same.</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">5. The third item, a sum of RM40,099 is made up of several

separate sub-items. First, the plaintiffs paid the chief engineer of the vessel a sum of RM10,000

for himself and the engine room crew for carrying out emergency repairs to the vessel on 21 March

1995 and 25 March 1995. The plaintiffs did not, however, produce any evidence of a legal obligation

to make such payments. The chief engineer and the engine room crew were employed on board the vessel

and it was part of their duties to maintain the engine and effect minor repairs. No document was

produced showing that they were entitled to extra payments for major or emergency repairs. The

defendants submitted, and I agree, that this was a voluntary payment that cannot be recovered.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6. The second component of the RM40,099 claim was a claim for

RM11,500 representing the cost of hiring a speed boat to carry the plaintiffs technical

superintendent from Kuantan to the vessel during the two periods when the vessels engine broke

down. The vessel was apparently some 20 miles outside the port. There was no bill evidencing this

item and the only documentation adduced to support it were two internal vouchers produced by the

vessels managers in respect of payments they had made to the technical superintendent. As there

was no proof that this item was actually incurred by the superintendent, I cannot allow it.</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">7. The third component comprised payments made to the

superintendent as subsistence allowance, mileage allowance and hotel charges for his two visits to

Kuantan. These totalled RM2,423.50. Again the only evidence of these payments were the managers

internal vouchers. No contract setting out the terms of the subsistence allowance and the mileage

allowance was produced. Nor were any hotel bills adduced. Accordingly, this claim is disallowed.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8. The last component is the sum of RM16,176 that the plaintiffs

paid for some 4,000 litres of lubricating oil for the engine. The defendants objection to this

item is that the plaintiffs had decided that they would change the vessels lubricating oil when

the vessel returned from Haiphong. Accordingly, they would have incurred this expense even if the

engine had not broken down. I agree. This amount cannot be claimed.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Repair costs</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">9. The repair costs are made up of two bills from Wartsila Diesel

(Singapore) Pte Ltd (Wartsila), the manufacturers of the engine. They carried out the repairs

after the breakdowns. Their first bill is for the sum of $185,909.95 and covers repairs/inspections

of the main engine by service engineers at Kuantan from 27 March to 1 April 1995 and provision of

labour, floating crane hire and boat hire for permanent repairs at Singapore. The second bill in the

sum of $446,768.30 covers the supply of replacement parts to the engine. In respect of the first

bill, the defendants raised objections to items totalling $57,918.25 and in respect of the second

bill, they raised objections to items totalling $55,199.37. Their position was that either these

items were excessive or that they could not be attributed to the damage arising from the defendants

negligence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10. In response, the plaintiffs relied on the evidence of Mr

Michael Christopher Thompson, the surveyor from the Salvage Association, who was sent by the hull

underwriters of the vessel to establish the cause of the damage and ascertain the repairs required.

In his report dated 3 May 1995, Mr Thompson set out the recommended repairs effected and the repair

costs. He referred specifically to the two invoices that Wartsila had rendered and stated that these

invoices had been approved as being fair and reasonable for the work carried out and that such work

was attributable to the casualty under review. Subsequently, the Salvage Association approved the

invoices for payment and the underwriters paid the same.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">11. One of the objections that was raised related to the temporary

repairs done in Kuantan. At that stage, the no. 3 piston bearing was replaced and a new piston

assembly was put in. Subsequently, after the second breakdown, these new parts were found to be

damaged as well. The defendants argued that repairs of the new parts could not be claimed against

them because there was no evidence that the damage arose from their negligence. Mr Thompson,

however, who was aware of both the temporary and permanent repairs, was satisfied that these repairs

were also part of the damage arising from the negligent work of the defendants. He was not

questioned about how the subsequent damage to the new no. 3 piston and its accessories could have

arisen from the defendants negligence. Accordingly, I think it is too late for the defendants to

raise this point now.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">12. I will deal first with the bill for the replacement parts that

came to $446,768.30. Item no. 8 of this bill was $9,370.25 being the cost of replacing six sets of

piston rings. There was no evidence that all the piston rings were damaged. According to Wartsilas

report AB117, only pistons nos. 4 and 6 were renewed and the rest of the pistons were reused after

servicing. The defendants submitted that the plaintiffs thus should only have claimed the cost of

two sets of piston rings. That would have amounted to $3,123.42 ie $6,246.83 less than they claimed.

In Mr Thompsons report, however, it is stated that the pistons were re-ringed and he went on to

include this work as part of the permanent repairs. He also said that the rings were attributable to

the casualty. That being the case, I find the defendants must pay for it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">13. Item 16 on the bill was $14,165.45 for a complete set of

packing/locking materials. The plaintiffs did not show what those items were for and how the supply

of the same was attributable to the defendants default. Mr Thompsons report did not mention

this item at all. I disallow the amount.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">14. The defendants objected to the cost of $1,039.45 charged for

the lubricating oil filter elements replaced by Wartsila on the basis that these elements were

located outside the engine and their replacement was not attributable to the defendants work. Mr

Thompson, however, made specific reference to the lubricating oil filter elements as replacement

parts supplied on board the vessel in his report under the heading Recommended Repairs Effected.

Accordingly, I allow this item. The same response is applicable to the defendants objection to

item no. 10 that was the cost of $750.60 for replacement of the lubricating oil cooler kit. This was

another item specifically mentioned by Mr Thompson under that heading.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">15. I next turn to Wartsilas invoice for $185,909.95. I am

satisfied that most of the defendants objections have no substance in view of Mr Thompsons

report. One item for $8,022.60 was in respect of the replacement of the turbocharger kit. The

defendants submitted that there was no evidence that this item was damaged. In Mr Thompsons

report, the only reference to the turbocharger was that its bearings were suspect because the

turbocharger lubricating system was common with the main engine system. The turbocharger bearings

therefore had to be checked. Whilst the turbocharger itself had to be removed, checked and cleaned,

according to Mr Thompsons report, he did not state that the turbocharger itself required

replacement. Accordingly, I disallow this item.</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">16. There was also an item for $2,546 in respect of the

supply of the cylindrical bearings set for the lubricating oil pump and drive box. The defendants

objected on the basis that the lubricating oil pump was located at the lower part of the engine and

would not be affected by the improper fitting of the connecting rods. Mr Thompsons report does

not mention this item. I disallow it.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">17. On this part of the claim, therefore, I have disallowed items

totalling $24,734.05. The plaintiffs claims for repairs is therefore reduced to $607,944.20.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Conclusion</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">18. In the result, I award the plaintiffs damages of $28,000 being

the cost of towage services and $607,944.20 being the cost of repairs together with interest thereon

at 6% p.a. from the date my first judgment in this action ie 5 April 2002.</font></p>
