<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       When an employee who is in a fiduciary
                    relationship with his employer uses his employer’s business opportunities,
                    time and revenue-generating equipment to earn a secret profit for himself, what
                    are the principles on which the court will assess the employee’s
                    obligation to pay equitable compensation to his employer? That is the principal
                    question raised on this registrar’s appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd
                    (“QAM”) commenced this action on 17 September 2010 against three
                    defendants. The first defendant is Zhang Qing (“Zhang”), their
                    former employee and fiduciary. The second defendant is Feng Guiyu
                    (“Feng”), Zhang’s wife. The third defendant is Pinnacle
                    Microelectronic Pte Ltd (“Pinnacle”), the corporate vehicle by
                    which Zhang earned his secret profits. On 25 November 2010, QAM applied for
                    summary judgment against the defendants with damages to be assessed. When that
                    application came up for hearing on 24 January 2011, the defendants consented to
                    interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The discovery exercise for the assessment of
                    damages commenced in March 2011 and concluded in December 2011. The parties
                    exchanged affidavits of evidence in chief for the assessment in early March
                    2012. QAM adduced the evidence of two witnesses: (a) Benjamin Wright Brown
                    (“Brown”), the managing director of QAM; and (b) Tan Kah Leong, a
                    manager of Tecbiz Frisman Pte Ltd (“Tecbiz”). QAM engaged Tecbiz
                    to provide the computer forensic and digital investigation services it needed to
                    uncover Zhang’s wrongdoing which forms the subject-matter of these
                    proceedings. The evidence on behalf of the defendants came from Zhang and Feng,
                    each of whom filed an affidavit of evidence in chief on their own behalf and on
                    behalf of Pinnacle. The defendants called no other witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Assistant Registrar (“AR”)
                    heard evidence in the assessment on 19 March 2012 and 20 March 2012. By her
                    decision on 10 September 2012, she assessed the damages which the defendants
                    were to pay to QAM at a total of $72,462.10 plus, as is usual, interest and
                    costs. The defendants appealed to a judge in chambers against the entirety of
                    the AR’s award of damages by way of Registrar’s Appeal No. 391 of
                    2012. I heard the defendants’ appeal on 16 November 2012. I dismissed the
                    defendants’ appeal, save in one relatively minor respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 14 December 2012, the defendants appealed to
                    the Court of Appeal against my decision. I now give my reasons for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The following introduction of the parties is
                    taken from the oral grounds of decision of the AR given on 10 September
                        2012:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    Quality Assurance Management Asia Pte Ltd
                            (“the Plaintiff”) is a company incorporated in Singapore
                            in the business of providing testing and inspection services to the
                            semiconductor and other electronics industries. The first defendant,
                            Zhang Qing (“1st Defendant”), is an ex-employee of the
                            Plaintiff who was in the Plaintiff’s employ from June 2002 to
                            September 2010. He was hired as a project engineer in 2002, and was
                            promoted to become the project manager of the Plaintiff on 1 March 2006.
                            The second defendant, Feng Guiyu (“2nd Defendant”) is the
                            1st Defendant’s wife. The third defendant, Pinnacle
                            Microelectronic Pte Ltd, (“3rd Defendant”) is a company
                            incorporated in Singapore in 2007, whose sole shareholder and director
                            up to 31 August 2010 was the 2nd Defendant. From 1 September 2010, the
                            1st Defendant has become the sole director of the 3rd Defendant. The 3rd
                            Defendant’s registered address is also the residential address of
                            the 1st and 2nd Defendants. On 17 September 2010, the Plaintiff brought
                            claim against the 1st Defendant for breach of employment contract and
                            fiduciary duties by diverting contracts from some of the
                            Plaintiff’s existing customers to the 3rd Defendant during the
                            period between November 2007 and September 2010. The Plaintiff also
                            brought a claim against each of the Defendants for an inquiry as to
                            damages for misuse [of] confidential information and conspiracy to
                            defraud the Plaintiff, and further or alternatively, an account of all
                            the profits made by the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">1st defendant’s employment history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Zhang joined QAM as a project engineer on 1 June

                        including planning, coordination, supervision and mentoring of site

                        as the primary point of contact with QAM’s clients assigned to him for

                        of a project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Just over 6 months later, on 17 September 2006,
                    QAM promoted Zhang to the position of branch cum general manager. In his new
                    position, Zhang was the second most senior operations personnel in QAM. The
                    promotion meant that Zhang became responsible for:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     All local sales

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        acquisition and maintenance of QAM’s equipment
                    inventory.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        planning and execution of site testing and analysis

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     Recruiting, training and deploying field personnel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Zhang’s rapid promotion and the duties
                    which QAM entrusted to him on each promotion make clear that QAM saw Zhang as a
                    highly trusted and valued employee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Indeed, in March 2009, just 18 months before
                    QAM was compelled to commence this action against Zhang, it presented him with
                    its Employee of the Year Award 2008 together with a monetary award worth
                        $8,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> QAM also supported Zhang’s
                    application for permanent residence in Singapore and later, Zhang’s
                    application to become a citizen of Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The wrongdoing which Zhang engaged in was an
                    especially cynical betrayal of the deep trust and confidence which QAM reposed
                    in him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pinnacle Microelectronics Pte Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Pinnacle was incorporated in 2007. Initially,
                    Feng was the sole shareholder and director. In 2009, QAM discovered
                    Pinnacle’s existence and about its connection to Zhang through
                        Feng.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> When confronted about this, Zhang
                    represented falsely to QAM that Pinnacle traded in industrial supplies unrelated
                    to QAM’s business and that there was no conflict in Feng managing the
                    business of Pinnacle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Zhang maintained the charade that Pinnacle was
                    not his alter ego in cross-examination. He insisted that Pinnacle was his
                    wife’s company, that he merely helped her out and that he did not run
                    Pinnacle’s business, even unofficially.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> But
                    the truth emerged in Feng’s evidence. She confirmed in her affidavit of
                    evidence in chief<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and
                    in cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that she did
                    not participate at all in the business of Pinnacle; it was Zhang who was solely
                    responsible for preparing all of Pinnacle’s quotations and purchase
                    invoices and for carrying out the work of Pinnacle. Feng was nothing more than a
                    front for Zhang from the outset. Zhang eventually conceded in his
                    cross-examination that Pinnacle was his business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Zhang resigns</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 15 August 2010, Zhang resigned<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> from QAM, saying that he intended to go
                    into a business similar to QAM’s but on a smaller scale.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> QAM then noticed that Zhang had been
                    coming to its office in the late hours of the night.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> QAM discovered that Zhang had
                    wrongfully downloaded its confidential information into a thumb
                        drive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Most significantly however, QAM discovered
                    that Zhang had, during his employment with QAM and contrary to his
                    representations, been operating the business of Pinnacle in direct competition
                    with QAM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Zhang’s wrongdoing was audacious in the
                    extreme. While he was still employed by QAM, he conducted Pinnacle’s
                    business from QAM’s office premises during QAM’s office hours. He
                    secretly diverted to Pinnacle for his own benefit customers of QAM who clearly
                    intended to deal with QAM (see [65] to [68] below). He conducted the testing
                    work for these diverted customers using QAM’s very own testing equipment
                    at QAM’s very own place of business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> He corresponded with QAM’s
                    customers on Pinnacle’s business during his working hours at QAM. He used
                    QAM’s very own office equipment in QAM’s very own office to generate
                    quotations, test reports and tax invoices from Pinnacle to these diverted
                        customers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> He gave as his
                    contact numbers on Pinnacle’s quotations and tax invoices his direct line
                    at QAM’s office and his mobile telephone number paid for by
                        QAM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He even returned
                    to QAM’s premises furtively on Sundays to carry out testing for these
                    customers. He kept secret from QAM and retained for his own benefit all of the
                    revenue and profits which he, through Pinnacle, earned by means of this
                    diversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Zhang was candid in
                        cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Zhang’s conduct was disgraceful. I have
                    no hesitation in characterising it as dishonest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">QAM elects to claim damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For these admitted perfidies, QAM sought
                    various relief against the defendants including injunctions, damages and account
                    of profits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Damages are, of
                    course, relief assessed based on the loss suffered by QAM. An account of profits
                    is relief based on the gain achieved by one or more of the defendants. It is
                    clear that QAM could not pursue <em>both</em> a loss-based
                    measure of relief <em>and</em> a gain-based measure of
                    relief arising from the same wrongful conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     So, following the consent judgment on
                    liability, QAM was put to an election as to whether it wished to claim damages
                    against all three defendants or an account of profits against all three
                    defendants. On 27 August 2012, QAM elected to claim damages. The assessment
                    therefore proceeded on the basis that QAM sought only damages against Zhang for
                    breach of his employment contract and for breach of his fiduciary duties; and
                    that QAM sought only damages against all three defendants for misuse of
                    confidential information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The only claims for relief which are relevant
                    for present purposes are therefore QAM’s prayers relating to damages.
                    These prayers comprised the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Against Zhang,
                    damages;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Against
                        Zhang, a declaration that he is not entitled to any remuneration including
                        his salary up to 15 September 2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     As against each defendant, an inquiry as to damages for
                        misuse of confidential information and conspiracy to defraud
                    QAM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 10 September 2012, the AR granted QAM leave
                    to amend its Statement of Claim to include the following further specific
                        claims:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Against Zhang, the return of all the
                        remuneration which QAM had paid to him from November 2007 to September 2010
                        comprising salary, allowances, bonus for the years 2008 and 2009 and the
                        $8,000 cash award paid to him in March 2009 for being its Employee of the
                        Year 2008;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Special damages of $17,581.10<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> being the sum which
                        QAM had paid to Tecbiz to conduct the forensic IT investigation into
                        Zhang’s clandestine activities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Leave to amend pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The AR granted QAM leave to amend as part of
                    her decision assessing the quantum of damages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Obviously, that was <em>after</em> the conclusion of the evidential phase of the assessment
                    of QAM’s damages. Zhang’s counsel therefore claimed that the late
                    grant of leave had caused Zhang prejudice in the evidential phase and that this
                    prejudice could not be compensated by costs. Zhang therefore appealed by way of
                    Registrar’s Appeal No. 390 of 2012 against the AR’s decision
                    granting QAM leave to amend. I heard that appeal together with Zhang’s
                    appeal against the AR’s decision on quantum. I found that appeal
                    unmeritorious also. Inserting these two additional heads of relief by amendment
                    caused Zhang no prejudice whatsoever for which he could not adequately be
                    compensated by costs. First, they were merely amplifications of the relief
                    already pleaded for damages and for the declaration. Second, even though the
                    leave to amend came after the evidential phase, the substance of the amendments
                    was foreshadowed to Zhang’s counsel at the very outset of the evidential
                    phase. Zhang’s counsel therefore cross-examined QAM’s two witnesses
                    on the issues raised by the amendment. Third, Zhang’s counsel was unable
                    to point to any specific evidence that he would have called in the evidential
                    phase but did not call in reliance on the pleadings as they then stood. I
                    therefore held that the AR was right to have granted leave to amend and
                    dismissed Zhang’s appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The introductory words of Zhang’s notice
                    of appeal to the Court of Appeal dated 14 December 2012 refers to both
                    Registrar’s Appeal No. 390 of 2012 (grant of leave to amend) and
                    Registrar’s Appeal No. 391 of 2012 (assessment of damages). But Zhang has
                    not sought or obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against my
                    decision on the amendment appeal, as is required. Further, the body of
                    Zhang’s notice of appeal does not list my decision to uphold the
                    amendments as one of the orders on which he appeals to the Court of Appeal. The
                    correctness of the AR’s decision to allow QAM’s application to amend
                    and of my decision to dismiss Zhang’s appeal from that decision are
                    therefore no longer live issues on this appeal. I therefore need say no more on
                    the issue of amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Employee as fiduciary</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Not every employee is a fiduciary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     QAM and Zhang were employer and employee. The
                    relationship of employer and employee – or master and servant as it used
                    to be known – is often said to be one of the well-established categories
                    of fiduciary relationships. As Gibbs CJ said in <em>Hospital
                        Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation</em> (1984) 156 CLR
                    41 at 69:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The archetype of a fiduciary is of course the trustee, but it is
                        recognized by the decisions of the courts that there are other classes of
                        persons who normally stand in a fiduciary relationship to one another
                        – e.g., partners, principal and agent, director and company, master
                        and servant, solicitor and client, tenant-for-life and remainderman. There
                        is no reason to suppose that these categories are closed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     But that should not be taken to mean that
                        <em>every</em> employee is a fiduciary for <em>every</em> employer in <em>every</em>
                    respect. If that were true, then every employee – no matter how junior his
                    status or how limited his responsibilities – would owe the whole range of
                    fiduciary obligations to his employer. That cannot be correct. The true position
                    is that the employer/employee relationship is one of the well-established
                    categories of legal relationships which is <em>capable</em>
                    of giving rise to a fiduciary relationship. But it does not <em>ipso facto</em> do so: whether a fiduciary relationship in fact
                    arises will depend on the facts of a particular case. “[C]ircumstances
                    may arise in the context of an employment relationship, or arise out of it,
                    which, when they occur, will place the employee in the position of a
                    fiduciary”: see <em>University of Nottingham v
                        Fishel</em> [2000] ICR 1462 at 1490.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Zhang admits he is a fiduciary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     QAM sought the relief listed at [20] and [21]
                    above on the basis of Zhang’s breaches of his contractual <em>and</em> fiduciary duties to QAM. QAM expressly pleaded that
                    Zhang owed it certain express contractual duties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> It further pleaded that he owed it the
                    following fiduciary duties superimposed by implication on those contractual
                        duties:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     A duty of good faith and
                        fidelity;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
                        duty not to act so as to place himself in a position in which his personal
                        interest did or might conflict with the interest of QAM;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     A duty to act bona fide in the
                        interests of QAM; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     A duty to act for the proper purposes of QAM in relation to its
                        affairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Zhang admitted that he owed these fiduciary
                    duties to QAM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> He therefore
                    admitted that he was a fiduciary for QAM. Zhang consented to interlocutory
                    judgment being entered against him on the basis of the assertions in QAM’s
                    pleadings. He therefore also admitted that he had breached those fiduciary
                    duties. All these concessions were rightly made. Given Zhang’s position in
                    QAM, given the scope of his responsibilities and given the degree of trust and
                    confidence which QAM reposed in him, there can be no doubt that Zhang as
                    employee was in a fiduciary relationship with QAM as employer. There can be no
                    doubt that Zhang owed QAM the specific fiduciary duties listed at [26] above.
                    There can be no doubt that Zhang breached his fiduciary duties and betrayed that
                    trust and confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is true that “[t]he phrase fiduciary
                    duties is a dangerous one, giving rise to a mistaken assumption that all
                    fiduciaries owe the same duties in all circumstances. That is not the
                    case.”: see <em>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd (No
                        1)</em> [1995] 2 AC 145 at 206. It is also “obvious that not
                    every breach of duty by a fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty”: see
                        <em>Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</em>
                    [1998] Ch 1 at 16C. These two observations are of especial application to
                    employees. But these observations pose no difficulties on the facts of this
                    case. QAM helpfully pleaded the precise fiduciary duties (see [26] above) on
                    which it based its claim. These duties are the very hallmarks of a fiduciary.
                    They are the core prescriptive duties of good faith and loyalty which are
                    peculiar to fiduciaries and which lie at the heart of the fiduciary obligation:
                    see Peter Millett, “Equity's Place in the Law of Commerce” (1998)
                    114 LQR 214. Moreover, as I have pointed out, Zhang admitted that he owed these
                    fiduciary duties and that he had breached them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consequences of Zhang being a fiduciary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Zhang’s admissions have significant
                    consequences for his liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     First, the duties of a fiduciary are high and
                    onerous duties. As GP Selvam J said in <em>Kumagai-Zenecon
                        Construction Pte Ltd and another v Low Hua Kin</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R)
                    1049 (“<em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em>”) at
                    [13]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The standard of duty imposed by law on a fiduciary is the highest standard
                        known to the law. It is a duty to act for someone else’s benefit by
                        sacrificing one’s own personal interest to that of the other. If the
                        fiduciary is not prepared to make such sacrifice he will never be able to
                        protect and advance the interest of the other. Selfishness is the antithesis
                        of selflessness. The office of a fiduciary is founded on selflessness.
                        Selfishness is absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although GP Selvam J’s decision went on appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal (see <em>Low Hua Kin v Kumagai-Zenecon Construction Pte
                        Ltd (in liquidation) and another</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 689), these
                    propositions of law were not challenged and the appeal was
                dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Second, because fiduciary duties are the
                    province of equity, a breach of fiduciary duty is an equitable wrong and unlocks
                    access to a range of equitable remedies. Chief amongst these remedies are an
                    account of profits and what is sometimes called – and what QAM in this
                    case called – damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is necessary at this point to be more
                    precise in our terms. Damages are not, of course, available as a remedy for an
                    equitable wrong. Equity has historically had no power to award damages. Only the
                    common law awards damages. It was not until the English legislature intervened
                    in 1858, through the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. 27)
                    – commonly known as Lord Cairns’ Act – that the English courts
                    of equity gained the power to award damages. In Singapore, the relevant
                    provision is found in paragraph 14 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). To avoid confusion, the term
                    “equitable damages” should be confined to damages awarded in
                    equity in exercise of this statutory power. But even this statutory innovation
                    permits equity to award damages only in lieu of or in addition to the equitable
                    remedy of an injunction or an order for specific performance. Equity still does
                    not have a general power to award “damages”. I note also in
                    passing that a common law court has a power to award damages in lieu of the
                    equitable remedy of rescission pursuant to section 2(2) of the Misrepresentation
                    Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     What equity has historically had the power to
                    award is an order to a trustee who has breached his duties to the beneficiary of
                    a trust to pay <em>equitable compensation</em> to the
                    beneficiary. As James LJ said (Baggallay LJ concurring, Bramwell LJ dissenting)
                    in <em>Re Collie ex p. Adamson</em> (1878) 8 Ch D 807 at
                    819:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Chancery never entertained a suit for damages occasioned by
                        fraudulent conduct or for breach of trust. The suit was always for an
                        equitable debt or liability in the nature of debt. It was a suit for
                        restitution of the actual money or thing, or value of the thing, of which
                        the cheated party had been cheated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     A word of caution. The word
                    “restitution” is used here – and in the modern cases on
                    equitable compensation – not as a legal term of art but purely as an
                    ordinary word of the English language meaning “recompense for injury or
                    loss.” The word “restitution” is therefore not used in
                    these cases to signify the restoration to its rightful owner of property which
                    has been lost or stolen. Nor is the word “restitution” used in
                    these cases in the same sense as it is used today in the modern law of
                    restitution – as being the law’s response to reverse unjust
                    enrichment at the expense of another. Put simply: equitable compensation is
                    neither a proprietary remedy nor a remedy in the law of restitution. It is a
                    personal remedy in equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Although equitable compensation began as a
                    remedy for breach of trust, the English courts fairly quickly made it available
                    for a breach of fiduciary duty by any fiduciary, not just by the archetypal
                    trustee: <em>Nocton v Lord Ashburton</em> [1914] AC
                    932.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The distinction between
                    “damages” and “equitable compensation” is not mere
                    semantics: it is a distinction with a difference, even today. Although common
                    law and equity are administered concurrently in the same courts (see s 3 of the
                    Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)), it remains the case that the courts (or at
                    least the High Court) remain precluded by precedent from awarding a common law
                    remedy for an equitable wrong. Equity supplements the common law by making
                    available in common law claims certain equitable remedies (such as injunction,
                    specific performance and rescission). Historically, equity has also appropriated
                    for itself and adapted certain common law remedies. Indeed, in the case of two
                    such examples – tracing and the account – equity’s
                    appropriation has been so successful that these remedies are now thought of as
                    equitable remedies. But the common law cannot and does not supplement equity. So
                    it remains the case today that common law damages is neither an available nor an
                    appropriate remedy for equitable wrongs. More importantly, as I will show in the
                    following paragraphs, there remains to this day a distinction of substance
                    between common law damages and equitable compensation rooted in the differing
                    approaches of the common law and equity to wrongdoing. Maintaining the
                    distinction in terminology is therefore not adherence to anachronism but assists
                    in focusing attention on this distinction of substance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The distinction of substance arises from the
                    view which each branch of the law takes of the innocent party and of the
                    wrongdoer. The starting point of the common law is that both the innocent party
                    and the wrongdoer are equal and independent actors, each capable of acting in
                    his own self-interest and each capable of safeguarding its own position. To that
                    extent, both stand before the common law on equal footing. The common law
                    therefore holds a balance between the two: see <em>Canson
                        Enterprises Ltd v Broughton &amp; Co</em> (1991) 85 DLR (4th) 129 at
                    154e <em>per</em> McLachlin J (as she then was) (Lamer CJ
                    and L’Heureux-Dubé J concurring). So although the common law acts to
                    vindicate the rights of the innocent party, it nevertheless has regard to the
                    interests of the wrongdoer by keeping the wrongdoer’s liability within
                    reasonable limits. The common law extends a measure of protection even to a
                    wrongdoer. It does this by hedging about the wrongdoer’s liability with
                    qualifiers based on causation, foreseeability and remoteness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Equity’s starting point is quite the
                    opposite. Equity takes as its starting point the trust and confidence which the
                    innocent party reposes in the wrongdoer. Equity therefore most emphatically does
                    not regard the innocent party and the wrongdoer as standing on equal footing.
                    The innocent party depends on the wrongdoer to act in the best interests of the
                    innocent party, and is thus especially vulnerable to the wrongdoer’s
                    breach of duty. When a fiduciary betrays the innocent party’s trust and
                    confidence, therefore, equity’s balance naturally favours the wronged over
                    the wrongdoer: see <em>Canson Enterprises Ltd</em> at 154g
                        <em>per</em> McLachlin J.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Equitable compensation contrasted with common law damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This difference of approach follows through
                    into the underlying purpose of each remedy. The primary function of both
                    remedies is to compensate the innocent party for a breach of duty by the
                    wrongdoer. It is not the core purpose of either remedy to punish the wrongdoer:
                    see <em>Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd</em> (2003) 197 ALR
                    626. But focusing on these commonalities is apt to mislead. The distinction of
                    substance leads directly to a practical differences between the two
                    remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It is no part of the core purpose of an award
                    of damages at common law to deter wrongdoing. Common law damages compensate the
                    plaintiff – to the extent that money can do so – for the loss he has
                    suffered. How that loss is characterised will depend on the particular branch of
                    the common law in question. In wholly exceptional cases, damages may be
                    available at common law to strip a wrongdoer of his gains where other common law
                    remedies are perceived to be inadequate: see <em>MFM Restaurants
                        Pte Ltd and another v Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd and another
                        appeal</em> [2011] 1 SLR 150 at [52] to [56] discussing <em>CHS CPO GmbH v Vikas Goel</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 202 and
                        <em>Attorney-General v Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd, Third
                        Party)</em> [2001] 1 AC 268. Despite these innovations, however, the
                    core purpose of common law damages remains purely compensatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     By way of contrast, it is part of the core
                    purpose of all remedies for equitable wrongs – including equitable
                    compensation – to deter the breaching fiduciary as well as other errant
                    fiduciaries and thereby to operate prophylactically. It is true that equitable
                    compensation, like common law damages, is assessed by reference to the amount of
                    money necessary to restore the victim of a breach of fiduciary duty to the
                    position the victim would have been in if not for the breach. But in doing so,
                    as the High Court of Australia explained in <em>Maguire and
                        another v Makaronis and another</em> (1997) 188 CLR 449
                        (“<em>Maguire</em>”) at 465,
                    “Equity intervenes (…) not so much to recoup a loss suffered by
                    the plaintiff as to hold the fiduciary to, and vindicate, the high duty owed to
                    the plaintiff.” This policy of deterrence explains equity’s
                    especially stringent principles governing the remedy of an account of profits:
                    see <em>Boardman and another v Phipps</em> [1967] 2 AC 46
                    and <em>Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver</em> [1967] 2 AC
                    134; and governing the remedy of tracing: see <em>In re
                        Hallett’s Estate</em> (1880) 13 Ch D 696.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The deterrent function of equitable
                    compensation means that the common law rules of causation, foreseeability and
                    remoteness – all designed to limit the law’s encroachment on the
                    freedom of action of common law wrongdoers by keeping their liability within
                    certain limits – do not readily apply to equitable wrongdoers. The strict
                    approach of equity is typified by the decision of the Privy Council on appeal
                    from the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Brickenden v London Loan
                        &amp; Savings Company of Canada et al</em> [1934] 3 DLR 465
                        (“<em>Brickenden</em>”). In that case,
                    Brickenden, a solicitor, had lent money to a borrower against mortgages. The
                    solicitor then acted for both the borrower and the holder of a prior mortgage in
                    a refinancing transaction. When the prior mortgagee advanced the money to the
                    borrower against the new mortgage, Brickenden retained part of the money and
                    applied it to redeem the mortgages which he held personally. Brickenden did not
                    disclose to the mortgagee his own personal interest in the transaction.
                    Brickenden was held liable to compensate the mortgagee, his client, for the loss
                    suffered when the borrower defaulted. Lord Thankerton, delivering the advice of
                    the Privy Council, said as follows (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When a party, holding a fiduciary relationship, commits a breach of his
                        duty by non-disclosure of material facts, which his constituent is entitled
                        to know in connection with the transaction, he cannot be heard to maintain
                        that disclosure would not have altered the decision to proceed with the
                        transaction, because the constituent’s action would be solely
                        determined by some other factor, such as the valuation by another party of
                        the property proposed to be mortgaged. Once the Court has determined that
                        the non-disclosed facts were material, speculation as to what course the
                        [company], on disclosure, would have taken is not relevant."</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     
          <em>Brickenden</em> is
                    therefore authority for the proposition that a claim for equitable compensation
                    arising from a breach of fiduciary duty will succeed so long as the wronged
                    party can show that the fiduciary’s breach of duty is in some way
                    connected to the loss, even if it was simply to set the occasion for the loss
                    rather than by being the cause of the loss in any legal sense of the word.
                        <em>Brickenden</em> read literally would therefore hold
                    a fiduciary liable to pay equitable compensation even if the principal would
                    have suffered the loss in any event: that is, if the principal would have
                    suffered the loss even if the fiduciary had not breached his duty. Such an
                    approach could be justifiable on the grounds that equity should protect the
                    interests of innocent parties who are owed fiduciary duties pursue deterrence
                    even if that means over-compensating the innocent party. But does <em>Brickenden</em> really go that far?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In <em>Target Holdings Ltd v
                        Redferns (a firm) &amp; Another</em> [1996] 1 AC 421(“<em>Target Holdings</em>”), Lord Browne-Wilkinson made
                    clear that that it did not, at least in England. Equity required the
                    fiduciary’s breach of duty to be a cause of the innocent party’s
                    loss on the “but for” test. Thus, at 432E Lord Browne-Wilkinson
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At common law there are two principles fundamental to the award of
                        damages. First, that the defendant's wrongful act must cause the damage
                        complained of. Second, that the plaintiff is to be put “in the same
                        position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for
                        which he is now getting his compensation or reparation:”
                        <em>Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Co.</em> (1880) 5
                        App.Cas. 25, 39, per Lord Blackburn. Although, as will appear, <em>in many ways equity approaches liability for making good a
                            breach of trust from a different starting point</em>, in my
                        judgment those two principles are applicable as much in equity as at common
                        law. Under both systems liability is fault-based: the defendant is only
                        liable for the consequences of the legal wrong he has done to the plaintiff
                        and to make good the damage caused by such wrong. He is not responsible for
                        damage not caused by his wrong or to pay by way of compensation more than
                        the loss suffered from such wrong. <em>The detailed rules of
                            equity as to causation and the quantification of loss differ, at least
                            ostensibly, from those applicable at common law</em>. But the
                        principles underlying both systems are the same. On the assumptions that had
                        to be made in the present case until the factual issues are resolved (i.e.
                        that the transaction would have gone through even if there had been no
                        breach of trust), the result reached by the Court of Appeal does not accord
                        with those principles. Redferns as trustees have been held liable to
                        compensate Target for a loss caused otherwise than by the breach of
                        trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The italicised words above make clear that
                    Lord Browne-Wilkinson was not asserting in this passage that <em>all</em> of the liability-limiting principles which apply to an award
                    of common law damages apply equally to an award of equitable compensation. The
                    following passage at 434C shows that of the various common law qualifiers on
                    damages, Lord Browne-Wilkinson was concerned with establishing only that the
                    common law “but for” test applied equally to equitable
                    compensation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(…) [T]he basic rule is that a trustee in breach of trust must
                        restore or pay to the trust estate either the assets which have been lost to
                        the estate by reason of the breach or compensation for such loss. Courts of
                        Equity did not award damages but, acting <em>in
                            personam</em>, ordered the defaulting trustee to restore the trust
                        estate: see <em>Nocton v. Lord Ashburton</em> [1914]
                        A.C. 932, 952, 958, per Viscount Haldane L.C. If specific restitution of the
                        trust property is not possible, then the liability of the trustee is to pay
                        sufficient compensation to the trust estate to put it back to what it would
                        have been had the breach not been committed: <em>Caffrey v.
                            Darby</em> (1801) 6 Ves. 488; <em>Clough v.
                            Bond</em> (1838) 3 M. &amp; C. 490. Even if the immediate cause of
                        the loss is the dishonesty or failure of a third party, the trustee is
                        liable to make good that loss to the trust estate if, but for the breach,
                        such loss would not have occurred: see Underhill and Hayton, Law of Trusts

                            for which compensation is recoverable</em>, viz. the fact that the
                        loss would not have occurred but for the breach: see also <em>In re Miller's Deed Trusts</em>(1978) 75 L.S.G. 454; <em>Nestle v. National Westminster Bank Plc.</em> [1993] 1

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">1    If a breach of a fiduciary obligation has been
                                committed then the fiduciary is liable to make restitution —
                                that is restore the wronged person [to] the same position as he
                                would have been [in] if no breach had been committed. Consideration

                    SLR(R) 1050 endorsed and applied these principles at [85]. These propositions of
                    law were likewise not challenged on the unsuccessful appeal in that case (see
                        <em>Creanovate Pte Ltd and another v Firstlink Energy Pte Ltd
                        and another appeal</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 780).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I make one final point: the cases I have cited
                    above have focused on the inapplicability of the common law principles of
                    causation, foreseeability and remoteness to the assessment and award of
                    equitable compensation. But the common law has other rules which serve to
                    limiting a wrongdoer’s liability to compensate one whom he has injured.
                    Examples of these rules are the rules relating to mitigation and comparative
                    fault. To what extent do these rules apply to equitable damages?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The key to this question lies in appreciating
                    another distinction between equitable compensation and common law damages. It
                    will be recalled that equity characterises equitable compensation as “an
                    equitable debt or liability in the nature of debt”: see [33] above. This
                    is significant. A claim in debt at common law is a money claim. If it succeeds,
                    it amounts to court-ordered enforcement of the performance of a <em>primary</em> obligation. A claim for damages is also a money
                    claim. But if it succeeds, it gives rise to a court order that the wrongdoer pay
                    damages to the innocent party. This is the creation of a <em>secondary</em> obligation: an obligation which comes into existence
                    only by virtue of the court order. So at common law, if a creditor claims $100
                    in debt against a debtor, it is a nonsense for the debtor to raise as defences
                    issues of causation, foreseeability or remoteness. It is equally a nonsense for
                    the debtor to raise as defences the creditor’s failure to mitigate his
                    loss or the creditor’s comparative fault. Equity follows the law. When
                    equity awards equitable compensation, it deems by a fiction that it is decreeing
                    performance of a primary obligation, ie, the defaulting fiduciary’s
                    obligation to pay an equitable debt. So on that basis, none of the common law
                    limiting principles – including mitigation and comparative fault –
                    ought to apply in a claim to recover equitable compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">When does equity take the strict approach in assessing equitable
                compensation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It will be noted at once that there is a
                    tension between Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s absolute and unqualified statement
                    that “the common law rules of remoteness of damage and causation do not
                    apply” (see [45] above) and GP Selvam JC’s qualified formulation,
                    itself taken from the formulation of Street J in <em>In re Dawson
                        (deceased); Union Fidelity Trustee Co Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co
                        Ltd</em> [1966] 2 NSWR 211 at 215, that limiting principles “do
                    not readily enter into the matter.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     This tension arises from two unique features
                    of claims against fiduciaries. First, the categories of fiduciaries are not
                    closed. Fiduciary duties can and are now found to arise from a variety of
                    relationships. Many of these relationships are far removed from the traditional
                    trustee/beneficiary relationship in which equitable compensation first became
                    available. It is not readily apparent that equity should be as stringent with
                    all fiduciaries as it is with the trustee fiduciary. Second, the strictness of
                    equity in protecting the innocent party means that a breach of fiduciary duty
                    can arise independently of any fault or culpability in any moral sense on the
                    part of the fiduciary. Both these features can give rise to cases in which the
                    strict <em>Brickenden</em> principle – even if it is
                    controlled by “but for” causation as imposed by <em>Target Holdings</em> – may operate unnecessarily harshly
                    against a non-trustee fiduciary. In these cases, the argument for equity tilting
                    the balance in favour of the innocent party at the expense of the wrongdoer is
                    significantly attenuated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The High Court of Australia in <em>Maguire</em> was troubled by these two features. Its solution
                    was to hold that <em>Brickenden</em> applies with all its
                    rigour where the fiduciary <em>is</em> in one of the
                    well-established categories and where the fiduciary commits a <em>culpable</em> breach of an obligation which stands at the very
                        <em>core</em> of that fiduciary relationship –
                    such as the duty of loyalty. The High Court of Australia said (at 474):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yet the policy of the law to hold the trustee up to the obligation to
                        perform the trust is strongly manifested in cases where loss is occasioned
                        upon breach arising from conflict between duty and interest. What one might
                        call that heightened concern is manifested also, as we have sought to
                        indicate earlier in these reasons, in the treatment of disloyalty by
                        non-trustee fiduciaries. It may be that concern with respect to the apparent
                        rigour of the reasoning in <em>Brickenden</em> reflects
                        what has been seen as a tendency apparent in some recent decisions too
                        readily to classify as fiduciary in nature relationships which might better
                        be seen as purely contractual or as giving rise to tortious liability.
                        Whilst that be so, it is not self-evident that the response should rest in a
                        general denial of the applicability of the reasoning in <em>Brickenden</em> to delinquent fiduciaries, particularly
                        solicitors and other professional advisers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Quentin Loh J considered this issue, <em>obiter</em>, in the case of <em>Then Khek
                        Khoon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another</em> [2012] 2
                    SLR 451 (“<em>Then Khek Khoon</em>”) at [51]
                    to [68]. Following a wide-ranging survey of Commonwealth case law and the
                    academic literature, Loh J concluded as follows at [67]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Kumagai Zenecon</em> and <em>Firstlink Energy</em> are correct on their facts and generally,
                        but they do not lay down an absolute rule that all loss and damage, no
                        matter how it is caused, lie at the doorstep of a party in breach of its
                        fiduciary obligations. In the latter case, this is what Andrew Ang J meant
                        when he said that causation, foreseeability and remoteness “…
                        do not <em>readily</em> enter into the matter
                        …” [emphasis added]. There may be circumstances, as in
                            <em>Canson Enterprises</em> ([62] supra) where
                        there are limits to the applicability of such an absolute rule. It is best
                        not to lay down any hard and fast rules. There are a significant number of
                        cases on equitable compensation in the other common law jurisdictions from
                        which guidance can be obtained. Strict rules and rigid criteria are not the
                        inherent nature of equity nor should it be for equitable compensation which
                        is but a part of the whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In my view, it aids certainty and
                    predictability to specify boundaries for the rigour of the principle in
                        <em>Brickenden</em> rather than to hold that the
                    principle is a discretionary one to be applied or disapplied on a case by case
                    basis. It will no doubt be a difficult task to ascertain what the boundaries of
                    the principle should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Fortunately, that is not my task. This case is
                    nowhere near the boundaries of <em>Brickenden</em>: it is
                    at the very core. It is therefore not necessary for me on the facts of this case
                    to decide what the precise boundaries of <em>Brickenden</em> are. Whatever those may be, <em>Brickenden</em> should and does apply with full stringency, at the
                    very least, to: (1) a fiduciary who is in one of the well-established categories
                    of fiduciary relationships; (2) who commits a culpable breach; (3) who breaches
                    an obligation which stands at the very core of the fiduciary relationship.
                    Brickenden was one such person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Zhang is another such person. First, Zhang was
                    admittedly a fiduciary for QAM. Even without Zhang’s admission, there
                    would be no novelty or innovation in holding him, as a senior employee, to be a
                    fiduciary for his employer. Second, the duties which Zhang breached (see [26]
                    above) are all aspects of the duty of loyalty. This duty stands at the very core
                    of the fiduciary relationship. It is the highest of the fiduciary duties and is
                    entitled to the highest protection. Third, Zhang’s breach was highly
                    culpable. It constituted conscious, deliberate and flagrant wrongdoing (see [7]
                    to [17] above). It was done for personal gain. It was dishonest. It was only one
                    technical step removed from putting his hand in his employer’s till and
                    stealing his employer’s money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Then Khek
                        Khoon</em>, Loh J said this at [64] in the context of a director of a
                    company:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It lies ill in the mouth of a company director who flagrantly breaches his
                        fiduciary duties for personal gain to say that the damage suffered by the
                        wronged party should be reduced because of principles of law relating to
                        causation or remoteness or that the innocent party was contributorily
                        responsible. In <em>Kumagai-Zenecon</em>, the CA gave
                        short shrift to the attempts by the fiduciary director to argue that the
                        action by provisional liquidators in selling off certain shares <em>en bloc</em> inflated the loss as they should have sold
                        off only that amount of shares necessary to pay the bank. The CA held that
                        the action of the provisional liquidators was reasonable in the
                        circumstances then prevailing and a subsequent rise in the market was
                        unforeseen and unforeseeable. The CA also said that bad faith or
                        unreasonableness was not established even though the provisional liquidator
                        had not made inquiries with stockbrokers or investment bankers before
                        effecting the en bloc sale of the shares. The CA was clearly not prepared to
                        place too heavy a burden on the actions of the party who was wronged or its
                        provisional liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Conceptually, it makes perfect sense for
                    equity to tilt the balance in favour of the innocent party and against the
                    wrongdoer in cases at the core of the <em>Brickenden</em>
                    principle. Doing so permits equity to advance its policy through its remedies
                    (see [38] above). Pragmatically also, it makes sense also to tilt the balance in
                    favour of the innocent party. By the very nature of a fiduciary relationship,
                    there will be informational asymmetries between the fiduciary and the principal
                    in these cases which will make the breach of fiduciary duty harder to detect and
                    harder to prove. The difficulties of detection mean that equity’s
                    additional stringency in these cases is warranted to ensure that the award of
                    equitable compensation serves its deterrent purpose. The harder wrongdoing is to
                    detect, the harsher the deterrent must be to achieve its intended effect. The
                    difficulties of proof mean that it is perfectly justifiable for equity to
                    advance its policy of deterrence by disentitling an equitable wrongdoer from
                    relying on the principles which limit the liability of a wrongdoer at common
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I conclude with some general principles on the
                    assessment of equitable compensation. The legal burden of proving but-for
                    causation remains on the plaintiff throughout: <em>Ohm Pacific
                        Sdn Bhd v Ng Hwee Cheng Doreen</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 633 at [27]. The
                    plaintiff must show that the loss would not have occurred but for the breach, or
                    that there was “an adequate or sufficient connection between the
                    equitable compensation claimed and the breach of fiduciary duty”: see
                        <em>Maguire</em> at 473. Equitable compensation is
                    assessed with the full benefit of hindsight and is quantified as at the date of
                    recoupment, not as at the date of the breach of duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     When a case comes within the boundaries of the
                        <em>Brickenden</em> principle, several additional
                    plaintiff-friendly consequences follow. Once the plaintiff adduces <em>some</em> evidence to connect the breach to the loss, equity
                    will readily shift the evidential burden on causation to the breaching
                    fiduciary: <em>John While Springs (S) Pte Ltd and Another v Goh
                        Sai Chuah Justin and Others</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 596
                        (“<em>John While Springs</em>”) at [6].
                    The court “does not allow an examination into the relative importance of
                    contributory causes”
                    <em>per</em> Spigelman CJ in <em>O’Halloran v RT Thomas &amp; Family Pty Ltd</em> (1998) 45
                    NSWLR 262 adopting the principle from the law of duress per Lord Cross of
                    Chelsea speaking for the majority in the case of <em>Barton
                        (Alexander) v Armstrong (Alexander Ewan)</em> [1976] AC 104. Causation
                    will therefore be determined shorn of the common law rules of foreseeability,
                    remoteness and <em>novus actus interveniens</em>: see
                        <em>Maguire</em> at 470. Principles of mitigation and
                    comparative fault have no role to play.</p>

                    which QAM would have earned on the contracts which Zhang diverted to Pinnacle in
                    breach of his fiduciary duties. Zhang submitted that QAM would have obtained
                    only 50% of these contracts for itself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The submission was fatally
                    undermined by Zhang’s admission in cross-examination (see [67] above). His
                    admission showed that it was Zhang who diverted all these contracts to Pinnacle.
                    QAM’s customers did not approach Pinnacle of their own accord. All of
                    these contracts were destined for QAM and would have been performed by QAM but
                    for Zhang’s wrongful diversion to Pinnacle. If he had not intervened, the
                    ensuing revenue and profits would have been earned by QAM. The AR was right to
                    reject Zhang’s submission. She relied on Zhang’s admission to hold
                    that QAM would have earned all of this revenue on all of these contracts had
                    Zhang not diverted them. The AR held that QAM had therefore proved that it had
                    lost $17,650 in revenue. Further, the AR held that QAM had also proved that the
                    “but for” test was satisfied: its loss of revenue of $17,650 was
                    attributable directly to Zhang’s breach of fiduciary duties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     From this revenue figure, the AR then assessed
                    QAM’s loss of profits as 50% of $17,650, or $8,825. She did this by
                    applying Brown’s evidence that QAM’s profit margin was
                        50%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> In doing so, she
                    adopted the approach suggested – albeit as an alternative submission
                    – by Zhang’s counsel in his written closing submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I saw no reason to interfere with the
                    AR’s reasoning or conclusion in awarding this sum as equitable

                    (“Ellipsiz”). The subcontractor for the project was J+J Technology
                    Pte Ltd (“J+J”). QAM has a good relationship with Cypress, both
                    organisations being headquartered in Texas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Further, Zhang admitted that Ellipsiz
                    and J+J were existing customers of QAM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Cypress Decatech project comprised two
                    parts. The first part was preparing a quality assurance report. The quality
                    assurance contract was the smaller part of the whole Cypress Decatech project
                    and was to be awarded by Ellipsiz.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The second part was the
                    testing contract. This was the major part of the Cypress Decatech project and
                    was to be awarded by J+J.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Zhang came to know of the Cypress Decatech
                    project in his capacity as an employee of QAM and at a time when he was still
                    employed by QAM and still owed fiduciary duties to QAM. If Zhang had performed
                    his fiduciary duties to QAM faithfully, he would have attempted to sell to
                    Cypress, Ellipsiz or J+J for the Cypress Decatech project, the suite of services
                    which QAM could offer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>
                    Instead, Zhang kept the information to himself out of his own
                        self-interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On or about 2 August 2010, Zhang caused QAM to
                    submit a quote of $17,000 to Ellipsiz, but only for the smaller quality
                    assurance contract. Zhang earmarked one of QAM’s quality assurance
                    engineers, Terence Chew, to perform the quality assurance
                contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     When Brown discovered this, he questioned
                    Zhang. He asked Zhang why he had not tried to sell QAM’s services as a
                    package to Cypress or to Ellipsiz or J+J.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> Zhang was not cooperative
                    and referred Brown to read for himself the documents relating to the Cypress
                    Decatech project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>
                    Two days later, Terence Chew resigned from QAM’s employ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> There is a strong
                    inference to be drawn that this was not a coincidence. QAM was due to have
                    commenced performance of the quality assurance contract at the end of August
                    2010, just as Zhang was coming to the end of his notice period. But Ellipsiz
                    told QAM that the quality assurance contract had been put on hold.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> QAM never did get
                    an opportunity to perform the quality assurance contract and thereby to earn a
                    profit under it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Without informing QAM,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> Zhang tendered a quote to Cypress
                    through Pinnacle at $49,500 for the testing contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> The computer
                    forensic investigation done by Tecbiz showed that Zhang tendered this quote on
                    or about 21 August 2010. Although he had by then tendered his resignation from
                        QAM,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> he was still an
                    employee and therefore a fiduciary for QAM. Zhang’s reason for not putting
                    a quote in for the testing contract on behalf of QAM was the same poor excuse
                    that he had given in relation to his other diversions of business opportunities:
                    that QAM did not have sufficient manpower and equipment to do the
                        job.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> But he conceded he
                    had no evidence to prove this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>
                    While still employed by QAM, Zhang went to J+J’s office in his capacity as
                    an employee of Pinnacle to solicit the testing contract from J+J. Zhang admitted
                    that he did this in breach of his employment contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     J+J belatedly asked QAM to submit a quote for
                    the testing contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>
                    This came at the last possible minute to tender a quote. QAM submitted a quote
                    on 9 September 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span>
                    J+J even told QAM that the testing contract had been awarded to QAM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> But no contract
                    ever materialised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>
                    QAM did not undertake the Cypress Decatech project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     If Zhang had told QAM about the Cypress
                    Decatech opportunity – as he should have – in early August 2010, QAM
                    would have had more lead time to mobilise its resources for the testing
                    contract. QAM’s quote would have been more competitive than it was. As it
                    was, QAM’s costs increased because its mobilisation time was
                        shortened.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> This was caused by
                    Zhang’s breach of his fiduciary duties in diverting the Cypress Decatech
                    opportunity for his own benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     QAM claimed against Zhang the losses they had
                    suffered by his diversion of the Cypress Decatech project away from
                        QAM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> The value of the
                    Cypress Decatech project was $66,500 comprising $17,000 for the quality
                    assurance contract plus $49,500 for the testing contract. The figure $49,500 is
                    taken from Zhang’s quote of $49,500 to J+J through Pinnacle for the
                    testing contract. QAM claimed that the entire value of the quality assurance
                    contract would have been pure profit for it. Performing the quality assurance
                    contract involved nothing more than deploying an existing QAM engineer to the
                    job. His salary had already been entirely absorbed as part of QAM’s
                        overhead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The quality assurance contract also
                    involved no out of pocket expenses, which the customer would bear in full. As
                    regards the testing contract, QAM submitted that its profit margin would have
                    been 50%,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> leaving 50% of
                    $49,500 or $24,750 as its lost profit. QAM therefore submitted that it could
                    have earned a profit on the Cypress Decatech project of $41,750<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> comprising the
                    entire $17,000 for the quality assurance contract plus $24,750 profit on the
                    testing contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     But QAM did not claim in these proceedings
                    this entire lost profit of $41,750. QAM accepted that what it really lost on the
                    Cypress Decatech project was a 50% chance of securing it and of earning the
                    overall profit of $41,750. So it claimed instead $20,875, being 50% of the lost
                    profit representing the value of its lost chance to win these
                contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Zhang submitted that QAM failed to satisfy the
                    prerequisites for an award of damages for a loss of a chance
                        because:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     QAM did not lose the chance to
                        secure the contracts for the Cypress project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> QAM in fact had the chance to
                        put in a quote for the Cypress project and took that chance by putting in a
                        quote.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if
                        QAM did lose the chance, it failed to establish that the chance that it lost
                        was real and substantial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even if QAM lost a real and substantial chance,
                        it failed to prove a causal link between Zhang’s conduct and the loss
                        of that chance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_d"></a>(d)     Even if there was such a causal link, QAM failed to
                        adduce any evidence to support the AR’s finding that the chance it had
                        lost was a 50% chance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_e"></a>(e)     Even if it had lost a 50% chance, the AR failed to make
                        an appropriate deduction for QAM’s notional costs of pursuing the
                        Cypress project in assessing the notional lost profit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_f"></a>(f)     There was no evidence to show
                        QAM’s profit margin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_g"></a>(g)     QAM actually entered into a quality assurance
                        contract with Ellipsiz at a contract price of $17,000. If QAM indeed lost
                        profit on that contract, it was because of Ellipsiz’s breach and not
                        because of anything done by Zhang.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Zhang also submitted that QAM’s claim
                    should fail because there was no evidence that Pinnacle had secured the Cypress
                    Decatech project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> This point is
                    the easiest to dispose of. QAM’s claim was a claim for compensation
                    measured by its own loss, not by Pinnacle’s gain. It matters not,
                    therefore, whether Pinnacle made a gain on the Cypress Decatech project by
                    securing and performing the underlying contracts. The question is what, if any,
                    loss Zhang’s breaches of fiduciary caused to QAM applying the “but
                    for” test. In any event, if it was indeed true that Pinnacle did not
                    secure the Cypress Decatech project, it was only because QAM had commenced these
                    proceedings and secured injunctive relief to protect their position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     To dispose of Zhang’s remaining points,
                    one must bear in mind that what is being assessed is the equitable compensation
                    which Zhang ought to pay to QAM for breach of fiduciary duty. That breach is the
                    foundational breach which he committed when he received the Cypress Decatech
                    business opportunity as an employee of QAM in early August 2010 and decided not
                    to pursue it in its entirety for QAM’s benefit but to divert the substance
                    of it for the benefit of Pinnacle. If Zhang had pursued that opportunity to the
                    maximum extent possible for the benefit of QAM – as it was his fiduciary
                    duty to do – the evidence I have summarised above showed that there was
                    indeed a real and substantial chance that QAM would have had sufficient time to
                    put in a competitive quote to Cypress, not just for the quality assurance
                    contract but also for the testing contract as a total package.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Further, I bear in mind the principles I have
                    identified at [61] above. QAM adduced evidence relating to: (a) Zhang’s
                    connection with Chew, the engineer who mysteriously resigned; (b) Zhang’s
                    secret communications with Cypress, Ellipsiz and J+J; (c) the very close timing
                    of the events relating to the Cypress Decatech project and Zhang’s notice
                    of resignation and eventual departure from QAM; and (d) the fact that both
                    Ellipsiz and J+J on paper awarded contracts to QAM but both very unusually
                    failed to follow through by permitting QAM an opportunity to perform the
                    contracts. All of this left a strong inference that the hand of Zhang was behind
                    this lost opportunity. This inference was sufficiently strong to shift the
                    evidential burden of proof to Zhang. He failed to discharge that
                burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Bearing all of this in mind, I have no
                    hesitation in finding that the loss which QAM suffered on the Cypress Decatech
                    project was caused by Zhang on the “but for” analysis. It was not
                    necessary for QAM to establish that Zhang had diverted the Cypress Decatech
                    project to Pinnacle: it sufficed to show that but for Zhang’s conduct, QAM
                    lost the Cypress Decatech Project or lost a real and substantial chance to earn
                    a profit on the Cypress Decatech project. Beyond that, in a case within the
                        <em>Brickenden</em> principle such as this, the law
                    “does not allow an examination into the relative importance of
                    contributory causes” see [61] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I note finally that the sum awarded by the AR
                    as equitable compensation under this head incorporated proper deductions for
                    QAM’s costs and to reflect the fact that all it lost was a chance. First,
                    the AR discounted the equitable compensation awarded under the testing contract
                    by 50% to account for the costs that QAM would have incurred in earning the
                    profit on this contract. The equitable compensation under the quality assurance
                    contract required no discount for costs because the full revenue under this
                    contract would have gone straight to QAM’s bottom line, the associated
                    costs already having been incurred and paid as part of its overhead or to be
                    paid by the customer. Finally, the AR applied a discount of 50% to the lost
                    profit to reflect the fact that the overall award was ultimately for the loss of
                    a chance rather than for outright loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     One final point: the equitable compensation to
                    which QAM is entitled under this head is $20,875, calculated as I have set out
                    in [79]-[80] above. However, the AR awarded under this head $20,857. This was an
                    obvious arithmetical or typographical error, albeit <em>de
                        minimis</em>. Because this error was in favour of Zhang, and because
                    QAM did not appeal to me to increase the award under this head by the $18
                    necessary to arrive at $20,875, I did not vary this amount but left it as the AR
                    had awarded it.</p>

                    conforms with common sense and with Choo J’s analysis in <em>John Whiles Springs</em> (see [98] above) of a reasonable
                    employer’s approach on bonuses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Counsel for Zhang argued before me that the AR
                    had erred in allowing QAM to recover these bonuses on three grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     QAM’s claim for return of
                        bonuses and for the monetary award of $8,000 was not pleaded;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     QAM failed to show what the bonuses were paid
                        for and the extent to which Zhang’s breaches of duty undermined that
                        basis and therefore justified repayment;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_c"></a>(c)     QAM’s election to claim damages precludes
                        a claim for restitutionary relief as that would amount to double
                            recovery;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Zhang’s first ground</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     On 10 September 2012, the AR granted QAM leave
                    to plead by amendment its claim for the return of the bonuses and the monetary
                    award (see [21(a)] above). I dismissed Zhang’s appeal against the
                    AR’s decision to permit the amendment. Zhang does not appeal further
                    against that decision. The first ground raised by Zhang before me is therefore
                    no longer a live ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Zhang’s second ground</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     QAM’s statement of claim, in its final
                    amended form, pleaded an express prayer for the recovery of the $23,300 paid to
                    Zhang in bonuses. Its statement of claim, however, did not plead the precise
                    basis on which it alleged it was entitled to recover this sum. It is difficult
                    to characterise this sum either as damages at common law or compensation in
                    equity. This is because it is difficult as a matter of logic to say that
                    Zhang’s admitted breaches of duty <em>caused</em>
                    – in any sense of the word – QAM to pay this money to Zhang. QAM did
                    not even know about Zhang’s breaches of duty at the time of payment.
                    Establishing the necessary “but for” connection requires QAM to
                    show that Zhang owed QAM a duty to disclose his own wrongdoing. If there were
                    such a duty, either at common law or in equity, then it could be said that but
                    for Zhang’s breach of his duty to disclose his own wrongdoing, QAM would
                    never have paid the $23,300 to him. Is there such a duty?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     At common law, an employee has in general no
                    implied duty to confess his own misdeeds to his employer. But in the context of
                    a particular contract and on the facts of a particular case, an employee may
                    have an implied duty to report the misdeeds of <em>other</em> employees: see <em>Bell v Lever Brothers
                        Ltd</em> [1932] AC 161 at 228; <em>Sybron Corporation
                        and Another v Rochem Ltd and others</em> [1984] 1 Ch 112 cited in
                        <em>Chua Choon Cheng and others v Allgreen Properties
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 at [87] - [88].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In equity, the position is different. An
                    employee who is also a fiduciary and who owes his employer a general fiduciary
                    duty of loyalty – that is, a duty to act in good faith in the best
                    interests of his employer – is obliged pursuant to that general duty to
                    disclose his own wrongdoing to his employer: see <em>Item
                        Software (UK) Ltd v Fassihi</em> [2004] EWCA Civ 1244 at [41] - [44].
                    By his own admission, Zhang was a fiduciary who owed a duty of loyalty to QAM.
                    So QAM could, and probably should, have based its claim to recover from Zhang a
                    sum equivalent to the bonuses they had paid to him as being equitable
                    compensation for Zhang’s breach of his duty of loyalty in failing to
                    disclose his own wrongdoing to QAM. But that is not how QAM based its
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     QAM based its claim on the fact that QAM had
                    paid the bonuses to Zhang while labouring under a causative mistake of
                        fact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> QAM relied on the following
                    passage in the decision of Choo J in <em>John Whiles
                        Spring</em> at [7]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A bonus is generally a payment fashioned as a reward as well as an
                        incentive. No reasonable employer would have offered a bonus to a cheating
                        employee, or one who was in breach of his fiduciary duty as was the case
                        here. This would be a fair inference of fact from the admitted facts at
                        trial and is not dependent on any assessment of the reliability of
                        witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The AR accepted this submission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> and based her decision to permit
                    QAM to recover the bonuses explicitly on this passage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> She relied on Zhang’s
                    admissions as establishing the “but for” test of causation. QAM
                    was therefore entitled to recover the sum of $23,300 from Zhang as money had and
                    received, having been paid to Zhang without obligation – being <em>ex gratia</em> payments outside his employment contract
                    – and while labouring under an admittedly causative mistake of fact. This
                    is a restitutionary claim, in the modern and technical sense of the word. There
                    was no evidence from Zhang that he had changed his position, that QAM was
                    estopped or that he had any other defence to QAM’s restitutionary claim.
                    All of the foregoing suffices to ground recovery. Given that the mistake was
                    fundamental and by Zhang’s own admission operative, there is thus no room
                    for any further inquiry into why and for what reason QAM paid these bonuses to
                    Zhang. Zhang’s second ground failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Zhang’s third ground</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The gist of Zhang’s third ground was
                    that awarding QAM both equitable compensation under the other heads which the AR
                    allowed and awarding him a sum equivalent to these bonuses amounted to double
                    recovery. This argument is misconceived. There was no overlap between any of the
                    other heads of loss and the recovery of the bonuses. Each head of damage which
                    the AR awarded compensated QAM for a distinct and separate loss. QAM did not
                    recover more than it lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Zhang’s counsel also submitted that it
                    was an abuse of process in an assessment where a plaintiff has elected to claim
                    damages to advance a claim in restitution.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> He relied for this proposition on the
                    decision of Assistant Registrar Shaun Leong in <em>ABB Holdings
                        Pte Ltd and others v Sher Hock Guan Charles</em> [2010] SGHC 267. That
                    decision does not stand for the proposition advanced. In that case, a plaintiff
                    elected to claim damages and then attempted to recover restitutionary damages at
                    the assessment. That decision rightly makes the point that where a plaintiff is
                    put to an election between what is commonly referred to as damages and an
                    account of profits, the substance of the election is between a loss-based
                    measure of recovery and a gain-based measure of recovery. Although
                    restitutionary damages and an account of profits are distinct remedies, they are
                    both gain-based measures of recovery. A plaintiff who elects damages without any
                    reservations or qualifications elects to pursue a loss-based measure of recovery
                    and is thereby precluded from pursuing a gain-based measure of recovery,
                    whatever it may be called. It is therefore an abuse of process for that
                    plaintiff to attempt later to circumvent his election for a loss-based measure
                    of recovery by advancing a claim for restitutionary damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    That principle has no application to this
                    case. Zhang’s gain of $23,300 was mirrored exactly by QAM’s loss of
                    $23,300. The conceptual basis for the award of $23,300 was to compensate QAM for
                    the wealth subtracted from it by the mistaken payment. The conceptual basis of
                    recovery was not to strip Zhang of his gain. There was no abuse of process in
                    QAM seeking to recover all the money it had lost by reason of Zhang’s
                    misconduct or in its mistaken belief in the propriety of his conduct. The money
                    it lost included the $23,300 awarded to it under this head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Met One condensation nucleus counter </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    QAM uses a device known as a Met One
                    condensation nucleus counter to verify the cleanliness of high purity gas lines.
                    The cost of servicing a Met One counter is prohibitively high. QAM therefore
                    buys used Met One counters to cannibalise for spare parts to keep its own Met
                    One counters in running condition. At the time of the assessment, it had eight
                    Met One counters of which only one was working.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    QAM’s evidence was that it was limited
                    in how much testing business it could source because it had only one Met One
                        counter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> So in June 2008, Brown instructed Zhang to buy
                    a used Met One counter on eBay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Zhang eventually found
                    and bought a Met One counter on eBay. He paid $1,900 for it. He paid this sum
                    out of his own pocket.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> He did not
                    recover this sum from QAM. But he procured an invoice for the Met One counter
                    addressed to QAM. The Met One counter was delivered to QAM’s premises in
                    June 2008. Zhang immediately intercepted it and diverted it for his own use. He
                    informed Brown that he had had to return this Met One Counter to its seller
                    because it was damaged and could not be serviced.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span> That was a deliberate
                    deception. What Zhang did instead was to transfer possession of the Met One
                    counter to a company known as UPM Technology Pte Ltd (“UPM”). UPM
                    later rented the same Met One counter back to QAM at $1,000. Zhang admitted in
                    cross-examination that he then secretly pocketed this $1,000 for
                        himself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> UPM also, while Zhang was
                    employed by QAM, rented the same Met One counter to a direct competitor of QAM
                    who approached Zhang seeking a Met One counter in his capacity as an employee of
                    QAM. Zhang secretly pocketed $4,000 as a result of that other
                        transaction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> I emphasise again
                    the audacity of Zhang’s conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Further, Brown’s evidence was that
                    used Met One counters were rarely on the market and, in any event, this
                    particular model had been discontinued. QAM therefore claimed $50,000 being the
                    cost of a new Met One counter or, alternatively, $1,900 being the cost of a used
                    Met One counter. The AR allowed this head of claim, awarding QAM $1,900 being
                    the cost of a used Met One counter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I allowed Zhang’s appeal on this
                    point. QAM were of course precluded from recovering Zhang’s secret profits
                    totalling $5,000 because of its election to claim damages instead of an account
                    of profits. That gain of $5,000 was also not matched by any loss on QAM’s
                    side for which loss-based compensation could be awarded. It is true that QAM
                    paid $1,000 in rental to UPM. But QAM received the benefit of the use of the Met
                    One counter in exchange. There was no subtraction of QAM’s wealth.
                    Further, Zhang paid for the Met One counter. The Met One counter never became
                    the property of QAM. QAM led no evidence on any other losses it suffered by
                    having been deprived of the use of the Met One counter or of the opportunity to
                    purchase a used Met One counter. I therefore held that QAM was not entitled even
                    to recover the $1,900 under this head as awarded by the AR.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Zhang downloaded confidential information

                    detailed and in some cases specially-customised test procedures developed by QAM

                    employees to perform QAM’s work, quality plans prepared by QAM for their
                    clients or issued to QAM for particular projects, a master compilation of all of
                    QAM’s pricing to its clients in Singapore since 2005, a complete copy of
                    QAM’s technician training manual and a list of quotations from QAM’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The defendants failed to deliver up all of
                    this confidential information despite being ordered to do so by an interlocutory
                    injunction obtained in this action on 30 September 2010 and by a permanent
                    injunction which formed part of the consent judgment on 24 January
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    On 10 June 2011, QAM obtained an order for
                    specific discovery and for forensic inspection of a hard drive, two thumb drives
                    and a laptop computer belonging to the defendants. Tan Kah Leong of Tecbiz
                    carried out this forensic inspection. He discovered that the defendants had
                    indeed failed to deliver up all the documents in their possession containing
                    QAM’s confidential information and continued to use and disseminate these
                    documents to third parties without QAM’s knowledge, consent or
                        approval.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    QAM paid Tecbiz a total of
                        $17,580.10<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> for the computer
                    forensic and investigation services it carried out. These services were
                    reasonably necessary to uncover Zhang’s breaches of his contractual and
                    fiduciary obligations of confidence to QAM as well as of the interlocutory and
                    final injunctions to deliver up QAM's confidential material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    There can be no doubt that QAM would not
                    have incurred this expense but for Zhang’s breaches of his contractual and
                    fiduciary duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Zhang submitted that QAM could not recover
                    the fees paid to Tecbiz because that claim had not been properly pleaded and
                    particularised. The pleading issue is no longer a live issue on this appeal as
                    there is no further appeal against QAM’s successful application to amend
                    its pleading to claim this head of recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Zhang submitted that Tecbiz’s invoice
                    supporting QAM’s claim for fees was ambiguous, contained duplicated
                        work<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> and was
                    excessive, at least in part.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> Zhang’s counsel cross-examined
                    Tan Kah Leong on all of these issues. The AR did not accept as valid any of the
                    points made by Zhang’s counsel in cross-examination. She held that QAM was
                    entitled to recover the sum of $17,580.10 which QAM paid to Tecbiz as damages
                    flowing from Zhang’s breach of duties: <em>Chun Cheng
                        Fishery Enterprise Pte Ltd v Chuang Hern Hsiung</em> [2010] SGHC 298
                    at [13]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span>
                    (this decision was appealed against but not on this point in <em>Chun Cheng Fishery Enterprise Pte Ltd v Chuang Hern Hsiung and
                        another</em> [2011] SGHC 167).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I characterise QAM’s recovery under
                    this head as equitable compensation and not as damages. I make the point also
                    that Zhang’s liability must be considered in the light of the
                    plaintiff-friendly principles I have summarised at [61] above. Subject to those
                    two points, I agreed entirely with the AR that this sum was
                recoverable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    For the reasons set out above, the outcome
                    of the appeal before me was that the defendants were obliged to pay QAM the
                    following sums together with, as is usual, interest and costs:</p>
