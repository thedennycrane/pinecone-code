        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These are three related appeals against the
                    decisions of the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) in Suit
                    No 163 of 2008 (“Suit 163/2008”) (see <em>Koh
                        Joo Ann (alias Koh Choon Teck) v First Grade Agency Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 87 (“the GD”)). Suit 163/2008 concerned the
                    beneficial ownership of a strata unit known as 88 Stevens Road, Stevens
                    Court, #02-02, Singapore 257865 (“the Property”), which is
                    registered in the name of Koh Joo Ann (“Koh”). On
                    22 August 2007, First Grade Agency Pte Ltd (“First
                    Grade”) lodged a caveat against the Property (“the Caveat”)
                    on the basis that Koh held the Property on trust and that the legal title to the
                    Property was to be transferred by Koh upon demand. In Suit 163/2008, Koh sought,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the removal of the Caveat and a
                    declaration that Koh is the beneficial owner of the Property (“the
                    Declaration”). First Grade and another company, Inhil Investment Pte Ltd
                    (“Inhil”), counterclaimed for an order for Koh to transfer the
                    Property to a third company, Yeo Siak Hor Pte Ltd (“YSHPL”), or
                    such other nominee as may be nominated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appeals before this court are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     In Civil Appeal No 11 of 2009
                        (“CA 11/2009”), Tay Jui Chuan (also known as Tay Juhana)
                        (“Tay Juhana”) has appealed against the decision of the Judge
                        in Summons No 5194 of 2008 (“SUM 5194/2008”) to dismiss
                        an application for him to be added as a plaintiff to the counterclaim by
                        First Grade and Inhil.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     In Civil Appeal No 27 of 2009 (“CA 27/2009”),
                        First Grade and Inhil have appealed against the dismissal of their
                        counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     In
                        Civil Appeal No 28 of 2009 (“CA 28/2009”), Koh has
                        appealed against the decision of the Judge that the Property was held by Koh
                        on trust for Tay Juhana and that the trust arrangement was conceived to
                        evade the provisions of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274, 1985 Rev
                        Ed) (“the RPA”), which was in force at the time the Property
                        was transferred to Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For convenience, First Grade,
                    Inhil and Tay Juhana will be collectively referred to as “the
                    Appellants” in this judgment where appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       First Grade, Inhil and YSHPL were incorporated
                    in Singapore and are members of or are associated with the “Sambu
                    Group”. The Sambu Group is a group of more than a dozen companies
                    involved in the manufacturing of coconut-based products and is controlled by Tay
                    Juhana, its founder. Tay Juhana is also the patriarch of the Tay family and the
                    uncle of Koh. First Grade was the “marketing arm” of the Sambu
                    Group. At all material times, none of First Grade’s shareholders and
                    directors was a Singapore citizen. First Grade was therefore a “foreign
                    person” for the purposes of the RPA (<em>per</em>
                    s 2(1) of the RPA). Inhil was the property development arm of the Sambu
                    Group and its shareholders and directors were Singapore citizens at all material
                    times. Inhil was managed by Tay Ban Geok (also known as Tay Teng Hoei)
                    (“Mdm Tay”), the sister of Tay Juhana and Koh’s
                    maternal aunt. Sometime around the mid-1980s, Inhil developed six strata units
                    in a four-storey residential development (<em>ie</em>,
                    Stevens Court) for sale. As it was a four-storey residential development, the
                    sale of the strata units to “foreign persons” was prohibited under
                    s 3(1) of the RPA. According to the defence and counterclaim, after Stevens
                    Court was completed in 1996, the property market at that time was not favourable
                    for the sale of the units. Inhil, therefore, decided to transfer all strata
                    units, including the Property, to members of the Tay family (including Koh) who
                    were Singapore citizens. The consideration for the transfer of the Property to
                    Koh was stated as $700,000. It was alleged in the defence and counterclaim that
                    First Grade had paid $550,000 and that Inhil had paid the balance of $150,000
                    which (as Mdm Tay testified at trial) had been borrowed from Tay
                    Juhana.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In Suit 163/2008, Koh’s case (as found in
                    his pleadings and his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”)
                    filed for the trial) is, in substance, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Koh is the registered proprietor and
                        beneficial owner of the Property, which was transferred to him in 1996 as a
                        gift from Tay Juhana for whom Koh had worked for
                    28 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Koh’s mother died when he was seven years of age. He, thereafter,
                        stayed with his grandmother, Yeo Siak Hor (Tay Juhana’s mother), and
                        was financially supported by Tay Juhana. In 1976, six months after he
                        completed national service, Koh commenced work as a supervisor at PT Pulau
                        Sambu Kuala Enok (“PSK”), a company which was part of the
                        Sambu Group. Over the years, Koh worked his way up through the ranks and was
                        eventually appointed managing director of PSK in 1994 and vice-president in
                        the Sambu Group in 2000. He spent 28 years of his life working for Tay
                        Juhana.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Sometime
                        in 1993, Tay Juhana told Koh (in Teochew) at a meeting that he would give
                        Koh a unit in Stevens Court (which turned out to be the Property). The
                        reason for the gift was not disclosed to Koh. When asked by Tay Juhana what
                        he intended to do with the Property, Koh informed Tay Juhana that he
                        intended to give the Property to his daughter (whom he had with his first
                        wife) when she turned 21. One request Tay Juhana had was to be allowed to
                        use the Property as an informal office and for meetings. Koh agreed. At that
                        time, Tay Juhana knew that Koh would not be using the Property as his
                        residence because Koh already had a house in Singapore and was based in
                        Sumatra. Tay Juhana also knew that Koh had a mistress (who later became his
                        second wife), one Maigawaty, who was working for PSK.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a>(d)     At no time did Tay Juhana or anyone
                        else mention that Koh was to hold the Property on trust. Koh did not know
                        that the Property had been registered in his name until he received a
                        property tax bill for the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_e"></a>(e)     Koh did not pay the property tax and other outgoings for
                        the Property as it was being used by Tay Juhana as an informal office and to
                        hold meetings. Koh left the payments of these expenses to Tay Juhana to deal
                        with. Similarly, Koh was content to leave the subsidiary strata certificate
                        of title for the Property (“the SSCT”) with Tay
                    Juhana.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_f"></a>(f)     Koh was
                        happy to be treated as a member of the Tay family. In 1997, he acted as a
                        guarantor for loans amounting to “millions of US dollars”
                        extended to the Sambu Group by Bank Negara Indonesia (“BNI”).
                        In or about 2002 and 2003, when the Sambu Group was facing cash-flow
                        problems, he readily agreed to mortgage the Property to obtain bank loans to
                        assist.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_g"></a>(g)     In 2004,
                        Tay Juhana, after a falling out with Koh, dismissed Koh as the managing
                        director of PSK and demoted him to being a general manager in charge of
                        purchasing and production. Koh subsequently resigned from all his positions
                        in the Sambu Group on 16 August 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_h"></a>(h)     After Koh resigned, Tay Juhana called him for a
                        meeting on 25 August 2004 (“the 25 August 2004
                        Meeting”) at which Koh was asked to return all his shares in
                        companies in the Sambu Group (which Tay Juhana had earlier given to him) in
                        exchange for his release as a guarantor for loans granted by BNI to the
                        Sambu Group. Koh was angry but felt helpless and so he agreed to return all
                        his shares to Tay Juhana. Tay Juhana then told Koh that he regretted giving
                        him two properties and asked Koh three times to transfer the Property back
                        to him. Koh agreed. At this point, Tay Juhana said that he would support Koh
                        financially for the rest of Koh’s life.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_i"></a>(i)     On 13 September 2004, Koh went to the office
                        of First Grade and signed the share transfers for his shares in the Sambu
                        Group companies. He was also asked to sign two other documents,
                        namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_i-p3_i"></a>(i)       one dated 16 August
                            2004, which stated that he had no claim against First Grade with respect
                            to remuneration, fees, compensation for loss of office or on any account
                            whatsoever; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_i-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       one dated 13 September 2004, appointing
                            Mdm Tay to sell and dispose of the Property on such terms as she
                            thought fit (“the 13 September 2004
                        Letter”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2">He signed both documents. As at the date
                        that he swore his AEIC, Koh did not know whether a release of his guarantee
                        to BNI had been obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_j"></a>(j)     Between April and July 2007, Koh was asked to sign the
                        transfer instrument to transfer the Property to YSHPL. He was prepared to do
                        so on condition that he receive a written acknowledgement, signed by Tay
                        Juhana, that Tay Juhana would support him financially for the rest of his
                        life. However, Tay Juhana was unhappy with Koh for linking the issue of the
                        transfer of the Property with his promise of financial assistance. In the
                        end, Tay Juhana refused to provide the written acknowledgement and Koh did
                        not sign the transfer instrument.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_k"></a>(k)     On 22 August 2007, First Grade lodged the Caveat
                        against the Property, pursuant to s 115 of the Land Titles Act
                        (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the LTA”), claiming to be the
                        beneficial owner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[b]y virtue of an agreement between the Registered Proprietor and the
                            Caveator that the Registered Proprietor would hold (the Property) on
                            trust for the Caveator and that the legal title to the Property would be
                            transferred to the Caveator upon demand made by the Caveator on the
                            Registered Proprietor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Koh attempted to have the Caveat removed. After hearing
                        representations from Koh and First Grade, the Registrar of Titles eventually
                        decided that First Grade’s claim had to be adjudicated in court.
                        Accordingly, Koh was requested to obtain a court order to remove the
                        Caveat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The case for First Grade and/or Inhil, as set
                    out in the defence and counterclaim, is, in the main, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Property was transferred to Koh
                        “on condition that [Koh] was to work for the Sambu Group until
                        retirement, i.e. until he was 60 years of age, and that he would
                        faithfully discharge his duties in the course of his
                        employment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Property was transferred to Koh not as a gift and that Koh
                        “had agreed with Tay Juhana that he would hold the Property on
                        trust”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the alternative, given that the purchase monies for the Property had
                        been provided by First Grade and Inhil, Koh held the Property on an implied
                        and/or resulting trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     Koh had an agreement with Tay Juhana, which Tay Juhana had
                        made on behalf of First Grade and/or Inhil at the 25 August 2004
                        Meeting, to transfer/return the legal title of the Property to First Grade
                        and/or Inhil or any nominee appointed by First Grade and/or Inhil and/or Tay
                        Junana upon demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     Koh was not given possession of the SSCT and the keys to the
                        Property. Consistent with his role as trustee, he did not have to pay the
                        outgoings of the Property. Also, in 2002, he mortgaged the Property to
                        United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”) to secure loans; in 2003, he
                        again mortgaged the Property to UOB to secure loans for the benefit of
                        Fairteck Holdings Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of First
                    Grade.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     Koh had
                        agreed to relinquish the Property in consideration of Tay Juhana procuring
                        his discharge by BNI as a guarantor of loans from BNI. In part performance
                        of this agreement, he had, <em>inter alia</em>, signed
                        the 13 September 2004 Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_g"></a>(g)     In breach of trust and/or the agreement with Tay Juhana,
                        which Tay Juhana had made on behalf of First Grade and/or Inhil at the
                        25 August 2004 Meeting, Koh had refused to transfer the legal title of
                        the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings before the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Koh testified on his own behalf. He also
                    subpoenaed Mdm Tay to give evidence and she was cross-examined as a hostile
                    witness. In the course of the trial, there was an application, <em>viz</em>, SUM 5194/2008, to add Inhil and Tay Juhana as
                    plaintiffs to the counterclaim. The Judge only allowed Inhil to be added as Tay
                    Juhana was “indisputably a ‘foreign person’ within the
                    meaning of the [RPA] and ... could not be entitled beneficially to the
                    Property” (see the GD at [14]). At the conclusion of Koh’s case,
                    First Grade elected to call no evidence and submitted that it had no case to
                    answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Notwithstanding that neither First Grade, Inhil
                    nor Tay Juhana gave evidence to support their respective allegations against
                    Koh, the Judge rejected Koh’s unrebutted evidence that the Property was a
                    gift to him in appreciation of his services to the Sambu Group. Instead, he
                    found that Koh’s evidence was not satisfactory; accordingly, it was held
                    that Koh never had a beneficial interest in the Property and was holding it on
                    trust (for Tay Juhana). The Judge gave the following reasons for his decision in
                    the GD (at [24]–[29] and [32]–[36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    ... [T]he fact that Koh did not pay for the
                            property tax and maintenance charges was an indicator that he was not
                            the beneficial owner. Although he said that the Property was being used
                            by Tay Juhana as an office (at one time) and also as a meeting place, it
                            seemed to me that this begged the question - why was Koh not using the
                            Property even to earn some rent? It seemed to me that that was because
                            he was not the beneficial owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    Secondly, Koh did not keep the title deeds to the
                            Property. Koh’s explanation was that he was working and living in
                            a remote area, <em>viz</em>, Kuala Enok, and he had
                            had marital problems with his first wife and trusted Tay Juhana more
                            than her. This assertion, in my opinion, was dubious, as there was no
                            reason why Koh could not have kept the [SSCT] to the Property outside
                            the matrimonial home, if he was truly the beneficial owner. There was
                            also no suggestion that the title deeds of other properties acquired by
                            Koh after his marital woes started, were also not kept by
                        Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    Thirdly, the fact that Koh did not have a set of
                            the keys to the Property suggested that he was not the beneficial owner.
                            He explained that he was not staying there but I would have thought that
                            if he was the beneficial owner, he would want to keep a set of the keys
                            so as to check on the condition of the Property from time to
                            time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    Fourthly, there was the failure to move Maigawaty,
                            Koh’s girlfriend (who became his second wife) into the Property.
                            Under cross-examination, Koh testified that in 1998, there was racial
                            violence in Jakarta. So, he thought of moving Maigawaty to Singapore for
                            security. However, he did not move her into the Property. His
                            explanation was that he had promised his daughter from his first wife,
                            who was in secondary one at that time, that she would be given the
                            Property when she reached 21. By moving the second wife into the
                            Property, he would be breaking his promise to this daughter and his
                            promise was of importance to him. He claimed that he had mentioned this
                            intention to Tay Juhana in 1993 or 1994 when the transfer to Koh was
                            discussed. This daughter was then 11 years of age.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    I doubted the veracity of his gift explanation.
                            Firstly, moving Maigawaty into the Property, pending the acquisition of
                            another property in Singapore would not in itself compromise the
                            intended gift to this daughter. Secondly, as Koh admitted, he did not
                            take any step to transfer the Property to the daughter when she turned
                            21 in about 2004. His explanation was that he was preoccupied with his
                            divorce at that time, but he could not explain why he did not even bring
                            up the fact that he had promised the Property to this daughter when Tay
                            Juhana demanded the Property at the meeting on 25 August
                            2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    After the meeting of 25 August 2004, Koh
                            had signed a letter of appointment authorising Mdm Tay to, <em>inter alia</em>, “sell and dispose of [the
                            Property] either by private auction for such price as to her shall deem
                            reasonable, and to subject to terms and conditions, if any, as she shall
                            think fit”. At one point, he suggested that he did so because the
                            letter was to allow Mdm Tay to deal with the mortgage on the
                            Property. The second paragraph of the letter had included the following,
                            “(including giving notice to discharge the Mortgage)” but
                            it was clear from the letter that it was not confined to dealing with a
                            mortgage alone. In any event, Koh’s execution of that letter could
                            be said to be pursuant to his agreement to transfer the Property and so,
                            it did not add anything more to the factors in support of the existence
                            of a trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    Koh’s evidence that the Property was given to
                            him was not satisfactory in the circumstances and I concluded that he
                            held the Property on trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    Since there was a trust over the Property, the next
                            question was the identity of the beneficiary. The evidence suggested
                            that it was Tay Juhana who had provided the money for the purchase of
                            the Property. For instance, as mentioned above, Mdm Tay, when
                            cross-examined, said that the $150,000 that Inhil paid for the Property
                            had come from Tay Juhana, although she attempted to construe the money
                            received by Inhil as being a loan from Tay Juhana. She was later
                            cross-examined as to the source of the money for First Grade’s
                            payment of $550,000 for the Property. Her denials to a suggestion that
                            it was Tay Juhana who had provided the money were unconvincing. I would
                            add that Mdm Tay admitted that Tay Juhana had provided about 50 per cent
                            of the money needed to buy the Stevens Court land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    In any event, it was not material whether it was
                            Tay Juhana who had personally provided the money for the purchase of the
                            Property. In the first place, I found that the purchase was a sham.
                            Inhil had to dispose of the Property along with the other units of the
                            Project. The market was poor as First Grade and Inhil had alleged. So
                            each of the units was transferred to family members instead of being
                            sold to third parties. However, the transferees could not be
                            “foreign persons” in view of the requirements of the RPA
                            and the transfers were made to look as if they were done pursuant to
                            genuine sales. How could Inhil be <em>bona
                                fide</em> selling the Property to Koh for $700,000 and yet
                            purportedly pay for $150,000 of the purchase price? The other $550,000
                            purportedly came from First Grade which is a company in the Sambu Group.
                            I add that even if some of the units were meant to be beneficially owned
                            by the transferees, it was clear to me that this did not apply to the
                            Property for the reasons I have stated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The truth of the matter was that Tay Juhana was in
                            control of the Sambu Group. All the transfers were done on his bidding.
                            That is why when he spoke to Koh in 1993 or 1994 about the transfer of
                            the Property to Koh, Tay Juhana did not mention which company he was
                            representing. It was unnecessary to do so. Likewise, when Tay Juhana
                            spoke to Koh on 19 August 2004 to claim the Property back, he
                            again did not say which company he was representing. That is why First
                            Grade and Inhil had some difficulty in saying who the true owner was and
                            why there was an attempt to bring in Tay Juhana as a plaintiff in the
                            counterclaim as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    Accordingly, I was of the view that the true
                            beneficiary of the trust over the Property was Tay Juhana.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Having found that the true beneficiary of the
                    Property was Tay Juhana, the Judge further held that since Tay Juhana was a
                    foreign person who was prohibited by the RPA from acquiring any interest in the
                    Property, the trust in his favour was null and void. The Judge thus concluded
                    that the “consequence of a breach of the RPA is that the loss lies where
                    it falls and since Koh is the registered owner, he is entitled to the beneficial
                    ownership [of the Property] as well” (see the GD at [53]). He further
                    held that First Grade was a foreign person under the RPA (and, for that reason,
                    no trust could be created in its favour) and that Inhil was in substance a
                    foreign person under the RPA as it was controlled at all material times by Tay
                    Juhana – a fact which had probably not been disclosed to the relevant
                    authorities at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Judge also rejected the allegation of First
                    Grade and/or Inhil that the Property was transferred to Koh on the condition
                    that Koh was to hold the Property on trust until he faithfully served the Sambu
                    Group up to the age of 60 for the following reasons (see the GD at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If this allegation was true, then the payment by these others of property
                        tax or maintenance charges was neither here nor there since their units
                        would in any event also not belong to them. In any event, I did not accept
                        the allegation about the condition. This was a late allegation made by way
                        of an amendment to their pleadings. Secondly, if the Property was meant to
                        be an incentive to Koh to serve faithfully until he reached 60, there was no
                        valid reason why it should be transferred to him before he had met the
                        condition especially with all the attendant expenses, like stamp
                        duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In addition, the Judge rejected the
                    alternative counterclaim of First Grade and Inhil that Koh had agreed (at the
                    25 August 2004 Meeting) to relinquish his shares in companies in the
                    Sambu Group and to transfer the Property in exchange for his discharge as a
                    guarantor for the liabilities of the Sambu Group to BNI. He held that
                    Koh’s agreement to return the Property was made without any
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Judge stated the following in conclusion
                    (see the GD at [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I ordered First Grade to remove the Caveat by a certain deadline failing
                        which the Registrar of Titles was to cancel the notification of the Caveat.
                        I did not declare that Koh is the beneficial owner of the Property, which
                        was one of the reliefs sought, because, at that time, I thought that if I
                        were to make the declaration [<em>ie</em>, the
                        Declaration], I might give the impression that Koh had been given the
                        Property and it was not necessary to make the declaration since I was
                        ordering the removal of the Caveat. I also dismissed the counterclaim of
                        First Grade and Inhil.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Koh and the Appellants have appealed against
                    the decisions of the Judge. We will now consider the merits of their
                    appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Civil Appeal No 11 of 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In CA 11/2009, Tay Juhana has appealed
                    against the Judge’s decision not to add him as a plaintiff in the
                    counterclaim. This application to add Tay Juhana as a plaintiff was in response
                    to Koh’s case that Tay Juhana had entered into the agreement at the
                    25 August 2004 Meeting in his personal capacity. It may be recalled that
                    First Grade’s pleaded case is that Tay Juhana had entered into the
                    agreement on behalf of First Grade and/or Inhil – the agreement being that
                    Koh would transfer the Property to either First Grade, Inhil or a nominee of any
                    one of the Appellants (subsequently identified as YSHPL). The Judge had refused
                    to add Tay Juhana as a party because Tay Juhana was a foreign person who was
                    prohibited from acquiring any interest in the Property by virtue of the
                    RPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     We can dispose of this appeal summarily. In
                    our view, the Judge was correct not to add Tay Juhana as a party, not because he
                    was a foreign person, but because it was <em>unnecessary</em> for Tay Juhana to be a plaintiff in the
                    counterclaim. It is clear that Tay Juhana was not making a claim to the Property
                    in his personal capacity. If, as alleged by Tay Juhana and/or First Grade, Tay
                    Juhana had entered into the agreement on behalf of First Grade and/or Inhil, Tay
                    Juhana could have given evidence as a witness. It was not necessary for him to
                    be made a plaintiff <em>without a substantive
                    claim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     This appeal therefore has no merit and is
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Civil Appeal No 27 of 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In CA 27/2009, the grounds for the appeal
                    raised by First Grade and Inhil can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Judge was wrong to hold that the
                        agreement concluded at the 25 August 2004 Meeting was not
                        enforceable by Tay Juhana for the benefit of a non-foreign person –
                        this being YSHPL – based on a purposive interpretation of the RPA, and
                        furthermore, Koh had signed a letter authorising Mdm Tay to dispose of
                        the Property at her absolute discretion (which would have allowed her to
                        transfer the Property to YSHPL) (“ground
                    (a)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        agreement concluded at the 25 August 2004 Meeting was supported by
                        consideration as Koh had agreed to relinquish the Property in exchange for
                        Tay Juhana procuring Koh’s release as a guarantor for the loans from
                        BNI to the Sambu Group (“ground (b)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     The agreement concluded at the
                        25 August 2004 Meeting would be a cause of action independent of
                        any illegality (referring to <em>Tinsley v
                            Milligan</em> [1994] 1 AC 340, <em>Geoffrey Silverwood (Executor of the Estate of Daisy Silverwood) v
                            Arnold Silverwood, Andrew Silverwood and Gillian Whiteley</em>

                        (“ground (c)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Judge was wrong to find that Inhil was a foreign
                        person because Tay Juhana was in control of Inhil as it is only in
                        exceptional circumstances that the corporate veil would be lifted (referring
                        to <em>Thode Gerd Walter v Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd and
                            Others</em> [2009] SGHC 44) (“ground
                        (d)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Judge was wrong to find that Koh was entitled to the beneficial
                        ownership of the Property for the following reasons (“ground
                        (e)”):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_e-p3_i"></a>(i)       there was no provision in
                            the RPA to such effect;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_e-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       if the trust over the Property in favour of Tay
                            Juhana was null and void, an automatic resulting trust in favour of
                            Inhil would arise (referring to <em>Re Sick and Funeral
                                Society of St John’s Sunday School, Golcar</em> [1973]

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_e-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       such a resulting trust would not be
                            prohibited by the RPA having regard to the policy behind the RPA; the
                            RPA merely prohibits resulting trusts in favour of a foreign person and
                            at no time was Inhil a foreign person under the RPA (referring to

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_f"></a>(f)     It would be contrary to public policy for Koh to obtain a
                        beneficial interest from a failed illegal trust arrangement, to which he was
                        a willing participant (referring to <em>Taylor v
                            Chester</em> (1869) LR 4 QB 309, <em>Nelson and another v Nelson and others</em> (1995)

                        (“ground (f)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Our decisions on each of the grounds set out
                    above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     With respect to ground (a), the
                        Judge’s ruling was irrelevant since he found that the agreement made
                        at the 25 August 2004 Meeting, in so far as it pertained to the
                        transfer of the Property, was made without any consideration (see the GD at
                        [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     With
                        respect to ground (b), the Judge’s finding that there was no
                        consideration cannot be challenged since <em>neither First
                            Grade nor Inhil had testified or produced evidence to the
                            contrary</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     With respect to ground (c), it also fails for the
                        reason that grounds (a) and (b) fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     With respect to ground (d), the finding
                        that Inhil was a foreign person (on the ground that it was controlled by Tay
                        Juhana) was an unnecessary finding since the Judge had held that the
                        beneficiary of the trust arrangement over the Property was Tay Juhana (see
                        the GD at [33]–[35], which is set out at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). Counsel’s argument is relevant to ground
                        (e), but with respect to that ground, there was no evidence to support a
                        finding in relation to a resulting trust in favour of Inhil (see, further,
                        our comments on ground (e) below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     With respect to ground (e), even if First Grade and/or
                        Inhil had paid the consideration for the Property, no resulting trust would
                        have followed, whether automatically or otherwise, in favour of them. In the
                        first place, First Grade did not transfer the legal title to Koh. Second,
                        there was no evidence that Inhil did not effectually dispose of its legal
                        and equitable interest in the Property by selling it to Koh. In our view,
                        there was no basis for the Judge to infer that the transfers by Inhil were
                        done to avoid the RPA, given the fact that Inhil, as a licensed developer of
                        the units, had lawful title to the strata units it had
                    developed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_f"></a>(f)     With
                        respect to ground (f), there was no evidence that Koh held the Property
                        on trust for Tay Juhana. Neither he, First Grade nor Inhil had ever made
                        such a claim. It was entirely unnecessary for the Judge to hold that a trust
                        existed in favour of Tay Juhana and, concomitantly, that it was an illegal
                        trust (see also <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For the reasons set out in <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above, it is our view that the appeal in
                    CA 27/2009 must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Civil Appeal No 28 of 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In CA 28/2009, Koh contended, in essence,
                    that the Judge was wrong to have decided that the Property was held on trust for
                    Tay Juhana. A number of grounds were submitted including the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Judge was wrong to hold that he
                        had not discharged the burden of proof that he was <em>prima
                            facie</em> the beneficial owner of the Property and that his
                        evidence was unsatisfactory; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Judge’s finding that Tay Juhana was the
                        beneficial owner of the Property went against the weight of the
                        evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     We agree with Koh’s submission that the
                    Judge’s finding that Koh was holding the Property on trust for Tay Juhana
                    was contrary to the evidence before the court. Koh’s uncontradicted
                    evidence was that Tay Juhana had told him that the Property was a gift to him,
                    the Property was later registered in his name and that until First Grade lodged
                    the Caveat against the Property, no one had claimed a beneficial title to the
                    Property or that it was not a gift to him. Although the Judge did not expressly
                    say what kind of trust was being referred to and when the trust was created, it
                    is implicit in his reasoning that the trust was an express trust created at the
                    same instant of time the Property was transferred to Koh (see also <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> below). This finding is surprising because
                    Tay Juhana had never claimed to be the beneficial owner of the Property during
                    the entire proceedings and First Grade, Inhil and Mdm Tay had not made such
                    a claim on his behalf. First Grade had applied to join Tay Juhana as a plaintiff
                    in the counterclaim only for the purpose of proving that Tay Juhana had entered
                    into the agreement concluded at the 25 August 2004 Meeting on behalf
                    of First Grade and/or Inhil and not for himself. This application (which must
                    have been with the knowledge and consent of Tay Juhana given that he appealed,
                    in CA 11/2009, against the Judge’s decision) contradicts any assumption
                    that Tay Juhana was claiming the Property as a beneficial owner. The Judge
                    himself had in fact noted Tay Juhana’s position and observed that this was
                    not surprising because Tay Juhana was a foreign person under the RPA. Yet the
                    Judge, contrary to the pleadings and the evidence, made the finding that the
                    Property was held by Koh on trust for Tay Juhana from the outset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Furthermore, none of the Appellants gave
                    evidence to support their respective allegations and claims against Koh.
                    Mdm Tay was subpoenaed by Koh to give evidence and she was cross-examined
                    as a hostile witness. But even she admitted that she did not mention anything
                    about a trust to the lawyer who acted in the transfer of the Property to
                    Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Judge found that Koh was not the
                    beneficial owner of the Property because he had not satisfactorily explained why
                    he did not: (a) have possession of the SSCT, (b) pay the outgoings,
                    (c) have the keys to the Property, (d) use the Property or even rent
                    out the Property, and (e) move Maigawaty into the Property. It followed
                    that if Koh did not own the Property beneficially, someone else did, and, in the
                    Judge’s view, that person was Tay Juhana because he controlled the Sambu
                    Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     With respect, we cannot agree with this
                    conclusion for a number of reasons. The first is that none of the Appellants
                    gave evidence to contradict the evidence of Koh that Tay Juhana had told Koh
                    that a property in Stevens Court would be given to him. The Appellants who were
                    parties in this action, <em>viz</em>, First Grade and
                    Inhil, rested their allegations on a submission of no case to answer. The law on
                    such a submission is established (see <em>Lim Swee Kiang and
                        another v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and others</em> [2005]
                    4 SLR(R) 141  and the authorities cited therein). The Judge found
                    that Koh did not have the beneficial title to the Property because his
                    explanations on what he did not do with the Property were not satisfactory (see
                    the passages set out at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). In our
                    view, even assuming that Koh had the burden of proof (which is not the case
                    here), Koh’s explanations as to why he did not occupy the Property was not
                    incredible. We would further point out:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Property had been given to Koh
                        and he could have done as he pleased with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Koh had another home and, therefore, there would
                        be no particular reason for him to reside in the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     Since Tay
                        Juhana wanted to use the Property as a meeting place, there would be no
                        reason for Koh to object as Tay Juhana was his benefactor and also the
                        patriarch of the Tay family. Bearing in mind Tay Juhana’s status in
                        the Tay family, it was plausible that Koh should trust Tay Juhana with
                        possession of the SSCT. The fact that Koh did not pay the outgoings of the
                        Property was entirely consistent with the fact that the Property was not
                        used by him but by Tay Juhana.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     Koh’s unwillingness to move his mistress into the
                        Property was not incredible even though the Judge found it unsatisfactory.
                        Koh’s explanation was that other members of the Tay family were living
                        in Stevens Court and he did not want to embarrass them. It seems to us that
                        this was an entirely credible explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view,
                    Koh’s explanations should not have been rejected outright in the absence
                    of any evidence to the contrary. Furthermore, the Judge was wrong to infer that
                    the Property was held on trust for Tay Juhana when on the pleadings he had never
                    claimed a trust in his favour (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Secondly, it would appear that the Judge had
                    approached the case on the basis that Koh had the burden to prove that the
                    Property was not a gift to him. In our view, Koh had no burden to prove that he
                    is the beneficial owner. He is the registered owner of the Property and as such
                    has a good title against the whole world until it is proved otherwise. He has
                    indefeasible title to the Property by virtue of s 46(1) of the LTA, subject
                    only to overriding interests referred to therein and the claims set out in
                    s 46(2) as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Any person who claims an interest in the Property
                    adverse to that of Koh must prove that claim. In the present case, the adverse
                    claimants are First Grade and/or Inhil. First Grade lodged the Caveat to protect
                    its claim; but the lodgement of a caveat does not shift the burden of proving a
                    claim. No burden shifted to Koh, the caveatee in the present case. Koh appeared
                    – erroneously – to be required to prove his title to the Property
                    when the alleged protagonist in this case, Tay Juhana, was not a party to the
                    proceedings and had made no claim that Koh did not have the full title to the
                    Property. Indeed (according to Koh, and this was not contradicted) the fact that
                    Tay Juhana asked him for the return of the Property in consideration of which he
                    would secure Koh’s release from his bank guarantee is an implied admission
                    by Tay Juhana that the Property belonged to Koh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The statutory provision relevant to the claims
                    of First Grade and/or Inhil is s 46(2)(<em>b</em>)
                    (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>, above). It was on this basis that
                    First Grade lodged the Caveat, claiming that Koh had agreed with Tay Juhana at
                    the 25 August 2004 Meeting to transfer the Property to First Grade and/or
                    Inhil or their nominees and that the consideration for the agreement was Tay
                    Juhana’s promise to procure the release of Koh’s guarantee to BNI.
                    Koh’s testimony was that he agreed to do so after being pressurised by Tay
                    Juhana and that, after Koh had agreed to do so, Tay Juhana had agreed to support
                    him for life. The Judge accepted Koh’s evidence on this point and found
                    that Tay Juhana had provided no consideration for Koh’s promise to
                    relinquish the Property. This finding cannot be challenged as Tay Juhana did not
                    give evidence to contradict Koh’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Thirdly, the finding that Koh held the
                    Property on trust for Tay Juhana is not only contrary to Koh’s unrebutted
                    evidence, it was also inconsistent with the case as pleaded by First Grade
                    and/or Inhil. Moreover, as we have mentioned earlier, Tay Juhana had never
                    claimed that the Property was held on trust for him. Such a claim would be
                    inconsistent with the terms of the 25 August 2004 Meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Fourthly, the Judge’s finding would seem
                    to imply that Koh knew he was holding the Property on trust, secretly, for a
                    beneficiary whose identity was unknown to him and Tay Juhana (who was the secret
                    beneficiary) had knowingly entered into an illegal transaction and thereby
                    committed an offence or offences under the RPA. Indeed, the Judge also found
                    that Tay Juhana had probably not disclosed that he controlled Inhil to the
                    authorities. In our view, such a finding of probability of criminality should
                    not have been made against Tay Juhana when he was not a party to the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Fifthly, although the Judge found a trust in
                    favour of Tay Juhana (which was an illegal trust by reason of the RPA), he did
                    not explicitly state how the trust was created. It was not a resulting trust
                    since Tay Juhana did not claim to have paid the consideration (in fact, First
                    Grade and Inhil made the claim, without providing evidence on it). Neither First
                    Grade nor Inhil claimed a constructive trust. Accordingly, it must have been an
                    express oral trust. If so, such a trust would have not been compliant with
                    s 7 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) which provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Trusts respecting immovable
                            property and disposition of equitable interest</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>7</b>.—(1) A declaration of trust
                        respecting any immovable property or any interest in such property must be
                        manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person who is able to
                        declare such trust or by his will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    A disposition of an equitable interest or trust
                            subsisting at the time of the disposition must be in writing signed by
                            the person disposing of the same or by his agent lawfully authorised in
                            writing or by will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    This section does not affect the creation or
                            operation of resulting, implied or constructive trusts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, the only person who could declare such a
                    trust in 1996 and/or in 2004 was Koh as the registered proprietor. Not only was
                    there no such declaration in writing, Koh denied the existence of such a trust
                    and any disposal of an equitable interest in the Property to any person. That
                    this was the true legal position is confirmed by the fact that First Grade and
                    Inhil pleaded a fall-back argument of there being a resulting trust in their
                    favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Finally, whilst Koh gave a coherent account of
                    how he came to own the Property as the registered proprietor (which was not
                    contradicted), the Appellants were not able to make a coherent claim to the
                    Property. As we have mentioned earlier, First Grade, Inhil and Mdm Tay had
                    never claimed that the Property was held by Koh on trust for Tay Juhana. In
                    contrast, First Grade pleaded (a) that the Property was transferred to Koh
                    “on condition that [Koh] was to work for the Sambu Group until
                    retirement, i.e. until he was 60 years of age, and that he would faithfully
                    discharge his duties in the course of his employment”; and also pleaded,
                        <em>inconsistently</em> it would appear, (b) that
                    the Property was transferred to Koh not as a gift and that Koh “had
                    agreed with Tay Juhana that he would hold the Property on trust”. There
                    was absolutely no evidence to support these allegations. It was then argued that
                    the Property was held on a resulting trust for the benefit of First Grade and/or
                    Inhil because they paid the purchase consideration. The Judge was aware that
                    First Grade had “some difficulty in saying who the true owner was”
                    (see the GD at [35]). In our view, this was an understatement. All their claims
                    and arguments were shots in the dark. None of the Appellants had any idea who
                    the beneficial owner of the Property was and the reason is, to us, obvious.
                    There was no trust and there was no beneficiary and that is why they chose not
                    to call any witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For the above reasons, we make the following
                    orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     CA 11/2009 and CA 27/2009 are
                        dismissed with costs here and below. The Judge’s order directing First
                        Grade to forthwith remove the Caveat is affirmed. We also direct that
                        possession of the SSCT is to be delivered to Koh
                    immediately.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Koh’s appeal in CA 28/2009 is allowed with costs here and below and
                        the Declaration is granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     The usual consequential orders are to
                    apply.</p>
