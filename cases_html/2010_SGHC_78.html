<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff in the suit, VisionHealthOne
                    Corporation Pte Ltd (“Plaintiff”), applied for discovery of
                    documents against Bank of China Limited (“BOC”) in Summons
                    No 5937 of 2009 (“the Discovery Application”) pursuant to
                    O 24 r 6(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“Rules of Court”). The Assistant Registrar (“AR”)
                    allowed the Discovery Application and ordered BOC to produce the relevant
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The second defendant, Xing Rong Pte Ltd
                    (formerly known as Huadi Projects Pte Ltd)
                        (“2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant”) appealed against
                    the AR’s order for discovery (“Discovery Order”) in
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 449 of 2009 (RA449/09). The Plaintiff took out
                    an application to strike out RA449/09 in Summons No 6230 of 2009 (the
                    “Striking Out Application”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 11 January 2010, I allowed the Striking
                    Out Application and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant on
                    9 February 2010 filed an appeal against my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff’s claim arose from the
                    Cooperation Agreement dated 18 October 2003 between the Plaintiff and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant which object was to establish a
                    network of medical facilities in and outside China. The funds for the joint
                    venture would be provided solely by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Plaintiff claimed that it had entrusted the
                    sum of $2.125 million (the “Sum”) to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant for the purpose of the joint
                    venture. The Sum was transferred to the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s BOC account (“the Account”) in three tranches
                    between December 2003 and January 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    admitted that it had received the Sum. However, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant alleged that the receipt was
                    pursuant to a currency exchange transaction between the Plaintiff and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. Therefore, no funds were provided
                    under the Cooperation Agreement to further any proposals for the purpose of the
                    joint venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Plaintiff claimed that, <em>inter alia</em>, it was wrongfully induced into transferring the Sum
                    to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant through the latter and/or its
                    representative’s false and fraudulent misrepresentations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Prior to March 2007, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant represented to the Plaintiff that
                    it had remitted the Sum to a third party Chinese company, Fuzhou Huadi Hebang
                    Construction Renovation Engineering Company Ltd (“FHH”) in or
                    about 2004 for the purposes of the joint venture to establish a medical
                    facilities network in and outside China. However, the financial records of FHH
                    obtained by the Plaintiff did not reflect any such receipt of the
                Sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was the Plaintiff’s case that one of
                    the main disputed issues in the suit was to whom the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had transferred the Sum following
                    its receipt of the said Sum between December 2003 and January
                2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Plaintiff in its Discovery Application
                    sought production of documents from BOC relating to and/or evidencing the
                    movements, <em>ie</em>, into and out of the
                Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The AR, after hearing the Discovery
                    Application, allowed the Plaintiff to inspect and take copies of the following
                    documents (the “Ordered Documents”) with BOC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All bank statements, cheques, remittance slips, receipts,
                        transfer instructions and correspondence relating to and/or evidencing the
                        movements of the sum of S$2,125,000.00 which was deposited into the Account
                        of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant with Bank of China Limited
                        by way of:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    OCBC cheque no. 749325 dated
                                23 December 2003 for the sum of S$400,000.00;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    UOB cheque no. 642852 dated
                                23 December 2003 for the sum of S$1,100,000.00;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    UOB cheque no. 642853 dated
                                10 January 2004 for the sum of S$625,000.00</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">into and out of the Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Striking Out application was on the
                    grounds that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Defendant had no locus standi to challenge an Order of Court which was
                        solely directed to a third party <em>ie</em>, BOC;
                        and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        AR’s order was <em>res judicata</em> as between
                        the Plaintiff and BOC as the time for BOC to appeal against the said order
                        had lapsed. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s appeal was
                        therefore academic and served no practical purpose;
                    and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s appeal lacked
                        substantive merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s case was that the Discovery Order made against BOC would not
                    determine the issue that was in dispute between the parties, <em>ie</em>, the purpose of transferring the Sum to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     If it was found that the purpose of
                        the transfer of the Sum was for the Cooperation Agreement, as pleaded by the
                        Plaintiff, the proper recourse as against the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Defendant would be in respect of a breach of Cooperation Agreement in which
                        disclosure of the Ordered Documents would be irrelevant and unnecessary as
                        receipt of the said Sum was already admitted by the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     If it was found that the purpose of transfer was
                        for the currency exchange scheme, as pleaded by the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s position was that the
                        Ren Min Bi (under the currency exchange scheme) was paid out in China and
                        not out of the Sum in the account <em>ie</em>, the
                        $2.125 million received in Singapore was not transferred to
                    China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The grounds for the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s appeal were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Discovery Order was too wide as
                        it was not specific in time and did not state the exact period for which the
                        discovery was allowed; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Discovery Order was made before the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had filed its defence. As the
                        parameters of the dispute had not been drawn up properly by way of pleadings
                        at the time of the hearing of the Discovery Application, matters of
                        relevancy had not been adequately determined; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Discovery had previously been ordered
                        against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant of the same class of
                        documents in favour of the fourth defendant under O 24 r 6 of the
                        Rules of Court. Subsequently in Originating Summons No 383 of 2009
                        (Registrar’s Appeal No 171 of 2009) (“OS 383 of
                        2009”), Tay Yong Kwang J allowed the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s appeal and discharged
                        it from its duty to provide discovery. The same issues were later rehashed
                        before the AR and the AR’s decision effectively nullified
                        Tay J’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lack of <em>Locus Standi</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    had filed the appeal against the AR’s decision despite being neither a
                    party to the Discovery Application nor the subject of the AR’s order.
                        <em>Locus standi</em> to appeal against any and/or all
                    orders made in the Discovery Application against a third person who is not a
                    party to the main suit (<em>ie</em>, BOC in this case) does
                    not arise automatically from a person’s status (<em>ie</em>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s status)
                    as a party to the main suit.</p>

                    against the non-party from whom discovery is sought, <em>ie</em>, it is clearly envisaged that an application for non-party
                    discovery is a matter exclusively between the applicant and the non-party
                    respondent. This principle applies across the board to both instances in which

                    O 24 r 6(1)) and by way of summons in ongoing proceedings between two
                    parties (see O 24 r 6(2)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Notably, although the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was served with the application for
                    non-party discovery and was heard by the AR below, this did not <em>ipso facto</em> confer upon it standing to file an appeal.
                    All applications filed in an action are served on parties to the action
                        (<em>eg</em>, under O 24 r 6(2)), who may be
                    heard subject to the discretion of the court. This involvement, however, does
                    not by itself transform such parties into parties to <em>that</em> specific application with standing to appeal the same. Such
                    involvement <em>per se</em> has no bearing on the issue of
                        <em>locus standi</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the case of <em>Microsoft
                        Corporation and others v SM Summit Holdings Ltd and another</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1017, Yong Pung How CJ held that the applicants who
                    were prohibited by way of implied undertaking from using all documents and
                    copies obtained pursuant to a search warrant and information extracted therein
                    had <em>locus standi</em> to make an application to the
                    High Court for the restriction to be lifted. Yong CJ held (at [18])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the applicants were parties directly affected by the restriction, they
                        had a direct personal interest in seeking relief to vary the order of court
                        and/or to be released from the implied undertaking. It followed they must
                        have the <em>locus standi</em> to make an application
                        for the restriction to be lifted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, it can be deduced that in order to demonstrate <em>locus standi</em> to file an appeal against an order, one has
                    to show that one is affected or aggrieved by the court order and therefore has a
                    personal interest in seeking variation or release from the said order. Further
                    and in addition to that, where it is in the nature of an appeal, I take the view
                    that the appellant must generally be a party to the application below that gave
                    rise to the orders that form the subject of his appeal before he has standing to
                    appeal against those orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On the facts, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was in no way personally encumbered
                    by the Discovery Order and its rights and interests vis-à-vis the main suit were
                    likewise unaffected. If anything, the production of Ordered Documents in the
                    possession of a non-party, BOC, would serve to substantiate or negate the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s version of the facts. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant could not be said to be affected or
                    aggrieved by the production of any relevant documents simply because they might
                    be or were potentially adverse against him. The whole purpose of discovery is to
                    enable relevant documents to be placed before the court and there is no inherent
                    right or interest to shut out relevant documents albeit adverse to that
                    party’s case, unless they fall within certain narrow exceptions such as
                    those privileged professional communications under s128 of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    might contend that it was affected or aggrieved by the Discovery Order by virtue
                    of its personal interest to maintain secrecy over its bank account with BOC
                    which was the main subject matter of the Discovery Order. This personal interest
                    could be said to have arisen under s 47 Banking Act (Cap 19,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (the “Act”), which prohibits the disclosure of
                    customer information by a bank in Singapore or any of its officers to any person
                    except as expressly provided in the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The bank’s duty of banking secrecy under
                    s 47, however, is not absolute. The Third Schedule of the Act expressly
                    provides that disclosure of information by a bank is not prohibited where it is
                    necessary for compliance with an order of the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof
                    pursuant to the powers conferred under Part IV of the Evidence Act. This
                    includes the power to make an order of production or inspection of
                    banker’s book under ss 174 and 175 of the Evidence Act respectively.
                    Hence, a court order made against the bank or its officers for production or
                    inspection would prevail over any personal interest the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant may have concerning the secrecy of
                    its bank account with BOC. In any event, this personal interest does not, by
                    itself, give rise to <em>locus standi to appeal</em>
                    against the order that was made in the Discovery Application by the Plaintiff,
                    which is against the non-party, BOC, and not against the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    should have asked BOC to appeal within the prescribed period after granting to
                    BOC <em>ie</em>, the party with legal standing to appeal,
                    an indemnity or sufficient security to BOC’s satisfaction for all
                    potential costs in connection with bringing an appeal against the Discovery
                    Order. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had erred in choosing to
                    appeal against the Discovery Order when it had no <em>locus
                        standi</em> to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Operation of Doctrine of <em>Res Judicata</em>
                in respect of the Discovery Order vis-à-vis BOC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The operation of the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> in respect of the Discovery Order made
                    against BOC would further preclude the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    from filing an appeal against the said order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The <em>locus
                        classicus</em> of <em>res judicata</em> is the
                    judgment of Wigram VC in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>
                    (1843) 3 Hare 100, at 115, where the judge says:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of
                        adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the
                        parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not
                        (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the
                        same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been
                        brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought
                        forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even
                        accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies,
                        except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was
                        actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a
                        judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of
                        litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might
                        have brought forward at the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> has been
                    applied in and affirmed by the Singapore courts: see <em>eg</em>, <em>Lee Tat Development Ptd Ltd v Management
                        Corporation of Grange Heights Strata Title No 301
                        (No 2)</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 and <em>Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu
                        Cho Chit and another appeal</em> [2000]
                1 SLR(R) 53.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It should be noted that the party with legal
                    standing to appeal against the AR’s decision, BOC, had not filed any such
                    appeal. The period for appealing the Discovery Order expired on 14 December
                    2009 and under these circumstances, the AR’s order had been perfected as
                    between the Plaintiff and BOC. This would be consistent with Tay Yong
                    Kwang J’s decision in <em>Nike International Ltd and
                        another v Campomar Sociedad Limitada</em> [2005] SGHC 139 at
                    [40] in which it was held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where an appeal lies against a decision but the right is not invoked by
                        the party entitled to that right, that decision is still final for the
                        purpose of <em>res judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Logically, the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> in cases involving more than one party with the
                    right of appeal operates in such a way that it renders the decision binding as
                    between the applicant and any party who chooses not to exercise its right to
                    appeal (see <em>Teo Chee Yeow Aloysious and another v Tan Harry
                        and another</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 588). As Chao Hick
                    Tin JA observed at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Suppose for a moment that in that case at hand only the first appellant
                        had appealed, but not the second, and that the first appellant had succeeded
                        in the way he did. Could the second appellant have come to the court after
                        the event to say that since the appellant’s liabilities were joint and
                        several, the amount of damages which the second appellant should pay to the
                        respondents should be the same as the reduced amount which the first
                        appellant was liable to pay? The answer is obviously not. Hence the second
                        appellant, having not appealed against the quantum assessed for the
                        dependency loss for whatever reason, must accept the consequences of its own
                        choice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Accordingly, even if the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had had standing to launch the
                    appeal and subsequently succeeded, BOC having not exercised its right to appeal
                    within the allowed time frame, would not be able to reap the fruits of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s appeal. A successful
                    outcome of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s appeal clearly
                    would have no bearing upon BOC’s accrued obligation to furnish the Ordered
                    Documents in compliance with the AR’s order since the finality of the said
                    order would be ensured by the operation of <em>res
                        judicata</em>. This would render the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s appeal merely academic as it would be incapable of reversing
                    or undoing what had already been perfected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The importance of the principle of <em>res judicata</em> was observed by the US Supreme
                    Court in <em>Federated Department Stores Inc v Moitie</em>
                    [1981] 452 US 394 at 401:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]his court has long recognized that [public] policy dictates that there
                        be an end of litigation; that those who have contested an issue shall be
                        bound by the result of the contest, and that matters once tried shall be
                        considered forever settled as between the parties... [The doctrine of
                            <em>res judicata</em>] is a rule of fundamental and
                        substantial justice, of ‘public policy and of private peace,’
                        which should be cordially regarded and enforced by the courts…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Viewed against the backdrop of the present
                    facts, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s appeal should be
                    struck out for want of standing. Any further determination on this appeal would
                    be, at best, academic and theoretical given that the Discovery Order was
                        <em>res judicata</em> as between BOC and the Plaintiff.
                    Such an exercise would not be conducive to public interest as it would waste the
                    court’s time and the litigant’s resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No Substantive Merits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In any event, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s appeal was without merit.
                    O 24 r 6(3)(<em>b</em>) clearly stated that the
                    documents sought in discovery must be “relevant to an issue arising or
                    likely to arise out of the claim made or likely to be made in the
                    proceedings”. Moreover, under the same provision, the person against whom
                    the order is sought must be “likely to have or have had [the documents]
                    in his possession, custody or power”. Following O 24 r 7,
                    discovery shall be refused in instances where it is not necessary either for
                    disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Ordered Documents could not be said to
                    have fallen foul of any of the requirements stated above as they were relevant
                    to the main suit, were in the possession of BOC and were necessary for the fair
                    disposal of the said suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Whether a document was relevant would depend
                    on whether it would affect a party’s claim, or adversely affect another
                    party’s case, or support another party’s case and it must depend on
                    the issues pleaded in the action: see <em>UMCI Ltd v Tokio Marine
                        &amp; Fire Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 95 at [71].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim,
                    it was clearly pleaded that at all material times prior to March 2007, the first
                    to third defendants had represented to the Plaintiff that the Sum had been
                    remitted by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to FHH in or about
                    2004. Hence, the <em>onward application</em> of the Sum
                    subsequent to the receipt by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant was a
                    matter in issue in the main suit. The Ordered Documents were relevant as they
                    would either affect or support the Plaintiff’s case: they would illustrate
                    the status and use of the Sum following the receipt by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant which in turn would be central in
                    establishing the alleged misappropriation by the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The 2nd Defendant’s position that the
                    Ordered Documents were irrelevant and unnecessary as receipt thereof was never
                    denied overlooked the broader picture of the dispute between the Plaintiff and
                    itself, <em>ie</em>, that there was an alleged
                    misappropriation on the part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    through its failure to transfer the Sum to FHH as represented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The crux of the Plaintiff’s case was
                    that: (a) the Sum was transferred to the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant pursuant to its representations that the Sum would be subsequently
                    transferred to FHH under the Cooperation Agreement; and (b) in breach of the
                    misrepresentations, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant failed to so
                    transfer the Sum and instead misappropriated it. Proof of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s dealings with the Sum after
                    its receipt would accordingly be critical to establishing the second limb of the
                    Plaintiff’s claim. Hence, the Ordered Documents were relevant as it would
                    directly enable the Plaintiff to advance his own case (see <em>Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano
                        Co</em> [1882] 11 QBD 55 at 63).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It was manifestly clear that BOC had
                    possession, control and/or custody of the Ordered Documents thus satisfying
                    O 24 r 6(3)(<em>b</em>). Moreover, the disclosure
                    of the Ordered Documents could not be said to be not necessary either for
                    disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs under O 24
                    r 7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     BOC has a document retention and destruction
                    policy to which the Ordered Documents are subject. Given that the payment of the
                    last tranche of the Sum into the account was made 6 years ago, there is an
                    imminent need for the Ordered Documents to be disclosed before they are
                    systematically destroyed by BOC. This is compounded by the fact that BOC might
                    be the only party holding such crucial information as the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had, through its solicitors,
                    earlier stated that the Ordered Documents were not in its
                possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The production of the Ordered Documents at
                    this stage would also serve a wider interest in it being facilitative of and
                    conducive to the parties in the main suit as the Plaintiff would not have to
                    wait until the trial to issue a writ of <em>subpoena duces
                        tecum</em> against BOC. As Lord Mackay in <em>O’Sullivan v Herdmans Ltd</em> [1987] 1 WLR 1047 at
                    1056 noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The interests of justice are, in my opinion, served by the promotion of
                        settlements rather than prolongation of litigation and by the possibility of
                        early, complete preparation for both parties to a trial rather than by
                        obliging one party to delay its full preparation until after the trial has
                        actually started.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In my view, the Ordered Documents were
                    relevant and necessary for the fair disposal of the issues in the Suit and the
                    Discovery Application was rightly allowed by the AR when he ordered BOC to
                    produce the documents. Accordingly, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s appeal before me also lacked merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     With regard to Tay J’s decision in
                    allowing the appeal filed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant
                    against the discovery order in OS 383 of 2009, I noted that factual
                    differences existed between OS 383 of 2009 and the present appeal which
                    should not be overlooked. OS 383 of 2009 was in fact a discovery against
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant which could be distinguished from
                    the present Discovery Application against a <em>non-party</em>. The AR in OS 383 of 2009 ordered, <em>inter alia</em>, for the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant <em>itself</em> to give discovery of the
                    documents sought. This was to be contrasted with the present appeal in which BOC
                    was the non-party required by the Discovery Order to provide the documents
                    sought by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     When the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant appealed against the AR’s order before Tay J, it was
                    decided apparently on the basis that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant was in no position to comply with the said order given that it had
                    affirmed on affidavit that it had no documents in its possession evidencing
                    payment of the Sum to third parties in relation to the Cooperation Agreement.
                    Hence, the scenario in that case was that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant, being the party encumbered with the duty to disclose the documents,
                    appealed against the order imposed upon it as it had no possession of them.
                    Tay J rightly discharged its duty to disclose as under those circumstances
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant would not be able to fulfil the
                    Discovery Order if indeed the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant had
                    truthfully affirmed that it no longer had the bank documents in
                question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The facts of the present appeal were, however,
                    dissimilar from that in OS 383 of 2009. That BOC had the bank documents
                    requested by the Plaintiff was not in dispute and the only real question at the
                    Discovery Application against BOC was one of relevancy and necessity. Thus any
                    argument about any potential nullification of Tay J’s decision by the
                    permission to allow discovery as against BOC was distracting and
                    misguided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In summary, the facts before me were that the
                    AR below had made an order, not against the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant, but against BOC, which had in its possession the same class of
                    documents that were sought in OS 383 of 2009. The Ordered Documents were
                    vital in establishing and resolving the disputed issues raised in the main suit.
                    Apart from substantiating the claim that there in fact was a receipt of such Sum
                    (which was admitted by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant), the
                    Discovery Order also served a wider facilitative purpose in allowing early
                    disclosure of documents crucial to the main suit itself. For instance, if upon
                    trial it was found that the Plaintiff’s version of facts was in fact true
                    and correct, <em>ie</em>. that the Sum was paid under the
                    Cooperation Agreement, the Ordered Documents would provide useful information
                    pertaining to the onward application of the Sum by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant by allowing the court to trace its
                    whereabouts since the transfer of the Sum into the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s account, including whether
                    or not the Sum was in fact subsequently paid over to FHH as represented by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in order to establish a medical
                    facilities network in and outside China pursuant to the joint venture. This
                    would assist the court in effectively determining the liability of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant under the Cooperation Agreement (if
                    any).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the event that the Sum was found to have
                    been paid to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant pursuant to a currency
                    exchange transaction, there is no apparent prejudice in disclosing the Ordered
                    Documents in respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s
                    account. The movement of the Sum that the Plaintiff was allowed to question and
                    scrutinise was limited only to those flowing from those cheques delineated by
                    the AR (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). The Discovery Order
                    was not by any means a blanket permission to intrude into the financial status
                    and activities of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. The Discovery
                    Order allowed only disclosure of documents that were necessary for the Plaintiff
                    to establish its claim. It was never intended to warrant a fishing expedition on
                    the Plaintiff’s part. Hence, details of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s use of its other financial resources would not by way of the
                    Discovery Order be exposed. As such, the financial interests of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant were sufficiently
                    safeguarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Discovery Order against a non-party was a
                    matter that was exclusive to the Plaintiff and the non-party, BOC. Any legal
                    grievances stemming from such an order should be raised and vented by either of
                    the two parties privy to the order. The 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Defendant’s filing of the appeal where BOC itself had chosen not to do so
                    was an attempt at circumventing the procedures of the court that were
                    streamlined to ensure the systematic and efficient administration of
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Given the lack of <em>locus
                        standi</em> and, in any event, the lack of substantive merits advanced
                    by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, I allowed the Striking Out
                    Application and awarded $3,000 as costs inclusive of disbursements for the
                    entire hearing to be paid by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant to the
                    Plaintiff.</p>
