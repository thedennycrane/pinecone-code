<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the Prosecution against
                    sentence. The District Judge (“the District Judge”) had imposed a
                    fine of $3,500 (with a default sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment) on
                    the respondent (“the respondent”) after convicting him of one
                    charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) in DAC
                    No 12681 of 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The maximum sentence for a s 323 offence is
                    two years’ imprisonment and/or a $5,000 fine. Two other charges against
                    the respondent were also taken into consideration by the District Judge,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     a second s 323 charge of causing
                        hurt to the respondent’s nine-year-old daughter (“the
                        Daughter”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     a s 298A(<em>b</em>) charge of hurling
                        racial insults at the victim, one Abdul Hamid bin Hassan (“the
                        Victim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I dismissed the appeal and recorded an
                    undertaking by the respondent to pay a sum of $1,000 as compensation to the
                    Victim. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The facts of this case are relatively
                    straightforward and have been admitted by the respondent. On 5 July 2009,
                    at about 5.55pm, the respondent was with the Daughter at Serangoon Bus
                    Interchange. He was slapping her face and neck, and pinching her forearm. The
                    Victim and his friend (the complainant) stepped in to intervene and asked the
                    respondent to stop the beating. The respondent told the complainant to mind his
                    own business, and insulted the Victim by saying “Malays are bastards,
                    Chinese are good”. The Victim told the respondent not to say such things,
                    whereupon the respondent punched the Victim on the nose. The Victim then pushed
                    the respondent to the ground in self-defence. After this, both parties stopped
                    and waited for the police to arrive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The respondent’s act of punching the
                    Victim caused the latter to suffer an undisplaced fracture of a nasal bone. The
                    respondent himself also suffered a displaced fracture to his nasal bone due to
                    the impact of being pushed to the ground by the Victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The District Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The District Judge held that there was no need
                    to impose a custodial sentence on the respondent, and that a fine of $3,500
                    would suffice because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     the respondent had no history of
                        violence, and his only criminal antecedents related to
                    gaming;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        respondent had struck only a single blow, and the altercation had lasted for
                        only a short period;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Victim had suffered only minor injuries, namely, an undisplaced
                        fracture of a nasal bone;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     there was clearly no premeditation behind the
                        respondent’s actions, and the respondent had acted on the spur of the
                        moment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     there were no other aggravating factors relating to the respondent’s
                        actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Prosecution appealed against the sentence
                    imposed by the District Judge, contending that the fine of $3,500 was manifestly
                    inadequate because of two main factors, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     the sentence given by the District
                        Judge was out of line with sentencing precedents; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the respondent had hurled a racial
                        insult at the Victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing precedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       A survey of the sentencing precedents reveals a
                    lack of consistency in the sentences imposed in s 323 cases.
                    Unsurprisingly, the cases cited by the Prosecution, such as <em>Agmir Singh v PP</em> Magistrate’s Appeal No 342 of 1992,
                        <em>PP v Gopal Maganathan</em> Magistrate’s
                    Appeal No 253 of 2001 and <em>Quek Kheok Seng v
                        PP</em> [2003] SGDC 198, were all cases where the District Courts
                    chose to impose custodial sentences on the offenders. Based on those cases, the
                    Prosecution submitted that a custodial sentence of between six weeks and three
                    months ought to be imposed on the respondent. On the other hand, there are also
                    a number of s 323 cases, such as <em>Lim Hung Khiang v
                        PP</em> Magistrate’s Appeal No 142 of 1997 and <em>PP v Chua Tian Bok Timothy</em> [2005] SGMC 4, where only a
                    fine was imposed on the offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       
          <em>Sim Yew Thong v Ng Loy Nam
                        Thomas and other appeals</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 155
                        (“<em>Sim Yew Thong</em>”) is one of the
                    few High Court decisions dealing with sentencing guidelines for the s 323
                    offence. There, the first accused, who was annoyed by the noise made by the
                    victims at the temple, punched the first victim and knocked him to the ground.
                    The second victim, who was the first victim’s 67-year-old mother, went to
                    help the first victim up. At this point, the second accused charged towards them
                    and knocked them to the ground. He further kicked the first victim in the
                    stomach. The first victim suffered bruises and tenderness, while the second
                    victim fractured a vertebra in her lower back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The second accused was convicted of two
                    charges under s 323 and was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment
                    for each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently. Chief Justice Yong
                    Pung How observed that the key factors which weighed against the second accused
                    were that the second victim had suffered severe injuries, and the second accused
                    had kicked the first victim even after the latter had fallen to the ground. On
                    the other hand, Yong CJ reduced the sentence of the first accused from two
                    weeks’ imprisonment to a fine of $1,000 because of the relatively minor
                    injuries inflicted by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     
          <em>Sim Yew Thong</em>
                    suggests that a custodial sentence is generally not imposed for a s 323
                    offence when: (a) the offender’s actions were not premeditated;
                    (b) the victim’s injuries were minor; and (c) the altercation
                    lasted for only a short time. Given these factors, as well as the wide range of
                    punishments meted out by the court to s 323 offenders, I was of the view
                    that it was difficult to say that the sentence meted out to the respondent in
                    the present case was out of line with the sentencing precedents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The hurling of a racial insult at the Victim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Prosecution submitted that the fact that
                    the respondent had hurled a racial insult at the Victim before attacking him was
                    an aggravating factor that justified the imposition of a custodial sentence. I
                    did not accept this submission as the Prosecution rightly did not submit that
                    the respondent’s attack on the Victim was a racially-motivated one. On the
                    evidence, the respondent did not go around looking for someone of a particular
                    race to pick a fight with. Instead, he was simply “minding his own
                    business” in disciplining the Daughter. When the Victim intervened, the
                    respondent warned him to back off. It was only when the Victim persisted with
                    his intervention that the respondent, who was by then extremely annoyed by the
                    Victim’s actions, uttered a racial insult and assaulted him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In other words, the respondent “lost
                    his cool” when he was repeatedly told by the Victim to stop beating the
                    Daughter. The race of the Victim was not a significant factor in the physical
                    attack, which had its roots in the respondent’s belief that the Victim was
                    persisting unreasonably in interfering with his (the respondent’s)
                    responsibilities as a father. Although the respondent’s act of uttering
                    racially insulting words at the Victim was an offence under
                        s 298A(<em>b</em>) of the Penal Code, I did not
                    give it too much weight as an aggravating factor because, as just mentioned, the
                    Victim’s race was not a factor which triggered the respondent’s
                    attack on the Victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Neither did I regard the second s 323
                    charge of causing hurt to the Daughter as an aggravating factor which warranted
                    an increase in the sentence meted out to the respondent. I was of the view that
                    a more appropriate form of “additional punishment” would be to
                    impose a monetary penalty on the respondent by means of an order to pay
                    compensation to the Victim under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion on sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Taking into account all the aforesaid
                    considerations, I was of the view that it was well within the District
                    Judge’s sentencing discretion not to impose a custodial sentence, but to
                    impose only a fine on the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Compensation for the Victim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As I stated earlier, I considered that the
                    circumstances of this case justified the making of a compensation order to
                    compensate the Victim. When this court suggested to the respondent that he
                    should agree to such an order, he replied that he was remorseful and would be
                    willing to pay compensation of an appropriate amount (which I indicated would be
                    $1,000) if the Victim was willing to accept such compensation. The Victim did
                    not object to my suggestion. The Prosecution informed the court that it had not
                    applied for a compensation order during the proceedings before the District
                    Judge, and that it was unlikely that the District Judge had considered the
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A technical problem then arose as to whether
                    the High Court, in its capacity as an <em>appellate</em>
                    court, had the power to order compensation in view of the wording of
                        s 401(1)(<em>b</em>) of the CPC, which provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>401</b>.—(1) <em>The court before which a person is convicted of any crime or
                            offence</em> may, in its discretion, make either or both of the
                        following orders against him:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    an order for the
                                payment by him of the costs of his prosecution or such part thereof
                                as the court directs;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    an order for the
                                payment by him of a sum to be fixed by the court by way of
                                compensation to any person or to the representatives of any person
                                injured in respect of his person, character or property by the crime
                                or offence for which the sentence is passed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Under s 401(1)(<em>b</em>), it is the <em>trial</em> court
                    convicting an offender of an offence which has the power to impose a
                    compensation order on him. This discretion is a judicial discretion, and, like
                    all other kinds of judicial discretion, “must be exercised not only in
                    accordance with the rules of reason and justice but also in accordance with the
                    provisions of the law” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Norzian bin Bintat</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 105 at
                [52]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In this case, the District Judge did not
                    consider whether it was appropriate for him to impose a compensation order on
                    the respondent under s 401(1)(<em>b</em>) of the CPC.
                    Neither did the Prosecution seek such an order. The question is whether, in a
                    case where the trial court has not imposed a compensation order, the High Court
                    has the power to impose such an order when it is hearing an appeal against the
                    sentence imposed by the trial court. The answer would appear to be
                    “No”. The powers of the High Court when hearing a criminal appeal
                    from the Subordinate Courts are set out in s 256 of the CPC.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee
                        Meow Sim Jenny</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 369
                        (“<em>Lee Meow Sim</em>”), the Court of
                    Appeal held that in an appeal against sentence, the powers of the High Court
                    under s 256(<em>c</em>) of the CPC were restricted to
                    reducing, enhancing or changing the nature of the sentence; the High Court had
                    no power to impose a compensation order on the accused when such an order was
                    not part of the sentence imposed by the trial court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Donohue Enilia</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 220 (“<em>Donohue Enilia</em>”), Yong CJ distinguished
                        <em>Lee Meow Sim</em> and made a compensation order on
                    the Prosecution’s appeal after the district judge refused to order
                    compensation to be paid by the accused to the victim. Yong CJ held that the
                    Prosecution’s appeal fell within s 256(<em>d</em>) of the CPC, <em>ie</em>, it was
                    “an appeal from any other order” and, thus, the High Court, in its
                    capacity as an appellate court, could “alter or reverse” the
                    district judge’s refusal to make a compensation order. Yong CJ said
                    at [14]–[15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    ... I made the observation in <em>Lim Poh Eng v PP</em> that a compensation order could
                            conceivably be varied under s 256(d) “in an appeal from any
                            other order”. I only stopped short of varying the compensation
                            order because the appeal in <em>Lim Poh Eng v
                                PP</em> had only been with regards to conviction and sentence
                            and s 256(d) therefore did not apply. Therefore, it is clear that
                            where an appeal lies against a compensation order made by the lower
                            court, such an appeal can be heard by the High Court and the order
                            accordingly maintained or varied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    The only problem in this appeal was that the trial
                            judge had made no compensation order at all. Strictly speaking, there
                            was no existing compensation order from which the Prosecution could
                            appeal. In other words, it was technically not “an appeal from
                            any other order” under s 256(d) of the CPC. Nevertheless, I
                            was of the view that there could be an appeal against the court’s
                            refusal to grant a compensation order. The opposite conclusion would be
                            absurd, for it would mean that an appeal would be possible if the court
                            awarded a manifestly inadequate amount of compensation, but no appeal
                            would be possible if the court refused to grant any compensation. It
                            cannot be Parliament’s intention for the High Court’s
                            appellate powers to be so circumscribed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The facts of the present case are different
                    from those in <em>Donohue Enilia</em> since, here, the
                    District Judge did not make a compensation order and hence there was no order
                    against which the Prosecution could appeal. Having regard to <em>Lee Meow Sim</em>, it was not within my power to order the respondent
                    to compensate the Victim. Notwithstanding this, since the respondent himself was
                    willing to pay compensation of $1,000 to the Victim as an expression of his
                    remorse, I decided to record his willingness to pay compensation in the amount
                    stated, but without prejudice to any civil claim that the Victim is entitled to
                    bring under the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Postscript on the making of compensation orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In concluding these grounds of decision, I
                    would like to make some observations on the purpose of compensation orders under
                    the CPC. The power to make compensation orders under s 401(1)(<em>b</em>) of the CPC is a benign and useful power which trial
                    judges should consider exercising in appropriate cases. Such cases would include
                    those where the offender has caused the victim physical injury in respect of
                    which the victim would be entitled to claim damages in a civil action.
                    Compensation orders are particularly suitable and appropriate for victims who
                    may have no financial means or have other difficulties in commencing civil
                    proceedings for damages against the offender. Although a custodial sentence or a
                    heavy fine may be appropriate as punishment for the offender, such punishments
                    are cold comfort to a victim who has experienced pain and suffering as a result
                    of the offender’s actions and who, as a result, has to bear the burden of
                    medical bills, lost wages and other expenses. In theory, the victim can always
                    bring a civil claim against the offender to recover damages for any loss
                    suffered. However, as just mentioned, this may not be practical for
                    disadvantaged or poor victims. In this regard, the following comment in
                        <em>R v Inwood (Roland Joseph)</em> (1974)
                    60 Cr App R 70 at 73 (cited by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Meow Sim</em> at [28]) is pertinent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Compensation orders were not introduced into our law to enable the
                        convicted to buy themselves out of the penalties for crime. Compensation
                        orders were introduced into our law as a convenient and rapid means of
                        avoiding the expense of resort to civil litigation when the criminal clearly
                        has means which would enable the compensation to be paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In a similar vein, the High Court in <em>Donohue Enilia</em> stated at [19] that “[a]
                    compensation order allows compensation to be recovered where a civil suit is an
                    inadequate remedy due to the impecuniosity of the person injured”. A
                    compensation order is therefore an efficient process to compel offenders to pay
                    damages to the victims without having to waste the economic and judicial
                    resources involved in the prosecution of a civil claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The quantum of compensation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As mentioned earlier, the power of the court
                    to order compensation under s 401(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the CPC is a discretionary power. The amount of compensation which the court can
                    order the offender to pay is at large. In <em>Donohue
                        Enilia</em>, Yong CJ, drawing upon English authorities,
                    summarised the principles relating to compensation orders as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    There are several principles relevant for the
                            purposes of deciding whether a compensation order should be
                            granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    Firstly, a compensation order does not form part of
                            the sentence (<em>PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny</em>;
                                <em>Lim Poh Eng v PP</em>), nor is it an
                            alternative to a sentence (<em>R v Miller</em>
                            [1976] Crim LR 694). Therefore, it should not be used as further
                            punishment of a convicted person, and the amount of compensation ordered
                            should not exceed the amount of damage caused: <em>Emperor v Maung Thin</em> (1909) 10 Cr LJ
                            78.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    Secondly, there must be a causal connection between
                            the offence of which the accused is convicted and the personal injury,
                            loss or damage in respect of which the compensation order is made:
                                <em>R v Deary</em> (1993)
                            14 Cr App R (S) 648. In other words, the court may make a
                            compensation order only in respect of the injury or loss which results
                            from the offence for which the accused is convicted. The court should
                            adopt a broad commonsense approach in assessing whether compensation
                            should be awarded. It should not allow itself to be enmeshed in refined
                            questions of causation which may arise in claims for damages under
                            contract law or tort law: <em>per</em>
                            McCullough J <em>in Bond v Chief Constable of
                                Kent</em> [1983] 1 All ER 456 ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    Thirdly, compensation will be ordered only in clear
                            cases where the damage is either proved or agreed: <em>R
                                v Vivian</em> [1979] 1 All ER 48. The assessment of loss
                            or damage must be based on evidence and not simply on representations by
                            the Prosecution: <em>R v Horsham Justices, ex parte
                                Richards</em> [1985] 2 All ER 1114.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Fourthly, it was established in <em>R v Daly</em> (1973) 58 Cr App R 333 that the
                            power to make compensation orders should only be used for dealing with
                            claims in straightforward cases. Compensation orders are designed for
                            cases where the amount of compensation can be readily and easily
                            ascertained, and are not for cases where the amount of damages or loss
                            is notoriously disputed: <em>R v Donovan</em>
                            (1981) 3 Cr App R (S) 192. Although the court can
                            hear evidence in order to determine questions as to the fact or quantum
                            of loss, the court should not embark on any complicated investigation:
                                <em>R v Briscoe</em> (1994)
                            15 Cr App R (S) 699. Indeed, an order should only be
                            made where the legal position is quite clear: <em>R v
                                Miller</em>. The court should decline to make a compensation
                            order unless it is based on very simply stated propositions which have
                            been agreed on or which are simple to resolve: <em>Hyde v
                                Emery</em> (1984) 6 Cr App R (S)
                        206.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    Fifthly, the order must not be oppressive, but must
                            be realistic in that the court must be satisfied that the accused either
                            has the means available, or will have the means, to pay the compensation
                            within a reasonable time (<em>R v Parker</em>
                            (1981) 3 Cr App R (S) 278). ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The amendments to the CPC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the past, the Subordinate Courts were
                    reluctant to exercise the power to order compensation on their own motion.
                    Similarly, the previous practice of the Prosecution was to refrain from seeking
                    compensation orders. However, in recent years, the courts have begun to make
                    such orders, although they have yet to develop an established practice of doing
                    so. The law has now been changed to require a court convicting an offender of
                    any offence to consider whether or not the making of a compensation order is
                    appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Section 401 of the CPC will
                    shortly be repealed and replaced by s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code
                    2010 (Act 15 of 2010) (“the CPC 2010”) which, the Ministry of
                    Law has announced, will come into force on 2 January 2011. Section 359
                    provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>359</b>.—(1) The court

                        way of compensation to the person injured, or his representative, in respect
                        of his person, character or property by —</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    If the court is of the view that it is appropriate
                            to make such an order referred to in subsection (1), it must do

                            prosecution was instituted to pay as compensation to the accused a sum

                            damages for malicious prosecution or false imprisonment beyond the
                            amount of compensation paid under the order, but any claim by the
                            accused for civil damages in respect of the malicious prosecution or
                            false imprisonment shall be deemed to have been satisfied to the extent
                            of the amount paid to him under an order for compensation</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The use of the word “shall” in
                    s 359(1) of the CPC 2010 makes it mandatory for judges hearing criminal
                    trials to consider whether a compensation order is appropriate, and, if so, to
                    make such an order. This amendment has effectively abrogated the decision in
                        <em>Lee Meow Sim</em>. As I stated earlier, the power
                    to order compensation is a benign and useful power, and the courts should make
                    compensation orders in suitable cases whenever it is appropriate to do
                    so.</p>
