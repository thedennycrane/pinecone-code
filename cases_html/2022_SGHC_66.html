</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As noted above at [34], the governing standard is that as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid</span>, which requires the counsel’s conduct of the case to fall so clearly below an objective standard, such that it raises a real possibility of a miscarriage of justice. A breach of the PCR provisions may not always amount to such egregious or flagrant conduct leading to a real possibility of a miscarriage of justice. The obligations under the PCR are a matter of professional responsibility, and whether the trial counsel has breached the PCR provisions is a separate matter for a different forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid</span> (at [136]), the spectrum of a legal practitioner’s duties to his client in a criminal case includes “advising a client on whether to plead guilty or to claim trial, whether to accept an offer made as part of plea bargaining, on matters prior to and during trial and also on whether to appeal and the grounds for doing so”. It is immediately clear that the PCR has obligations much wider than these core duties, some of which have nothing to do with (or are merely tangential to) whether an accused is provided adequate legal assistance in the criminal proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Much depends on the gravity of the breach and the type of PCR obligation in question. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Zhou Tong and others v Public Prosecutor</span> [2010] 4 SLR 534 (“<span class="font-italic">Zhou Tong</span>”), the counsel had failed to undertake any legal research and did not provide sentencing precedents to substantiate his clients’ positions (<span class="font-italic">Zhou Tong </span>at [8]). The counsel was “dreadfully unprepared” and had manifested a “disturbingly careless attitude” towards the matter (<span class="font-italic">Zhou Tong </span>at [11]). There was no doubt that the counsel had fallen short of the standards laid down in the previous version of the PCR relating to, amongst other obligations, the need to act with diligence and competence (<span class="font-italic">Zhou Tong </span>at [14]–[16]). It was in this context of inadequate legal assistance rendered by counsel that the <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> observation was made that it could have resulted in a miscarriage of justice (<span class="font-italic">Zhou Tong </span>at [2]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Here, the failure to keep contemporaneous records is not the kind of breach that would immediately imply that counsel’s conduct of the case fell so clearly below an objective standard. However, I will reiterate what the Court of Appeal had advised in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid</span> (at [151]) that it is indeed good practice for counsel to keep written records and notes when interacting with clients as it could protect them against unwarranted allegations in future. This is connected to the next point, which is that a legal practitioner who fails to keep contemporaneous records does so at his own peril.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the absence of contemporaneous records, the court may come to a view that an adverse inference should be drawn against the legal practitioner: <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Leong Pek Gan</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1091 at [48]. While the absence of attendance notes does not by itself deprive the legal practitioner’s testimony of all credibility (see <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay Khiang</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 at [83]), the veracity of the legal practitioner’s account could be doubted more readily due to this handicap.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Mr Aw was unable to produce all the attendance notes detailing his interactions with Noor. Mr Aw testified that some of them were located at his previous law firm and he had difficulty accessing them.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad </span><span class="font-italic">Farid </span>(at [135]) stated that deference and latitude would be given to counsel in the conduct of the case, and the court would not question legitimate and reasonable strategic or tactical decisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 To my mind, there was a logical sequence of events that culminated in the strategic choice made by Noor to co-operate with authorities, after Mr Aw had advised him on the appropriate options. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Starting with the attendance note on 3 April 2018 (reproduced in part above at [50]), it appears to me that Mr Aw had explained to Noor what the consequence of being charged with a capital offence entailed, and that if Noor did not obtain a CSA, the likelihood would be that he could possibly face the death penalty.

</div> I cannot see how there was any exhortation by Mr Aw for Noor to take a particular course of conduct at this juncture.

Noor expressly mentioned that he would like to try to reduce the capital charge against him by way of representations to the AGC, and should this fail, that he wished to defend his case. This suggests that Mr Aw did not force Noor into admitting knowledge of the drugs and co-operating with authorities at this point in time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Looking at the attendance note on 12 April 2018 (reproduced in part above at [51]), two options were outlined by Mr Aw to Noor in the form of “Option A” and “Option B”.

</div> The Defence interpreted that line to mean that the admissibility of Noor’s statements would be challenged, but this does not show that Noor’s defence of lack of knowledge was considered. I do not think that it is necessary to take such a restrictive reading of this line.

</div> It is inherent that in taking the case to trial, Noor would have to dispute the charge and raise every possible defence, including the fact that he did not know Zaini had brought drugs into Singapore. There was no need to detail what this defence would entail at this point, as it seemed that Mr Aw was still considering if Noor could be described as merely a courier as seen from the line right after he set out the two options: “Will consider if he is courier – cooperation”.

On the one hand, it could have recorded an exhortation or advice by the trial counsel to Noor that he had to admit to being a drug courier but that his role was limited to following Zaini, and to perhaps give statements stating that he knew about the drugs. On the other hand, the note is also capable of being interpreted to mean that the statements recorded earlier from Noor indicated that he knew about the drugs. Mr Aw’s explanation for this note was that the statements suggested that Noor knew about the drugs,

</div>
</div> I am more inclined to take the latter interpretation and believe Mr Aw’s explanation. Mr Aw’s explanation is corroborated by that of assisting counsel, Mr Mahadevan, who went through the statements with Mr Aw at the material time. It was explained that while Noor’s statements were not directly pointing to the fact that he had knowledge of the drugs, there were incriminating aspects where Noor explicitly detailed what he saw and did, and where Noor conceded that he could have asked Zaini about certain things.

</div>
</div> Further, if we look further down the attendance note, the only exhortations that can be found are “[d]on’t question IO” and “[d]on’t lie”. It is clear that Mr Aw advised Noor to be truthful in his statements and to not antagonize the investigation officer, but not necessarily to admit to having knowledge of the drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The written instructions dated 16 October 2018 from Noor to Mr Aw supports what has been set out in the 16 October 2018 attendance note. In the first two paragraphs from the relevant portions of the written instructions (reproduced at [55] above), we are told that Noor understood that he had to tell the truth about his role to the investigation officer and to inform of everything he knew. Once again, nothing shows that Mr Aw had coerced him into admitting that he had knowledge of the drugs, but he was only told to “tell the truth”. Moving down the document, the third paragraph of the 16 October 2018 written instructions is crucial. It suggests that Noor had finally chosen to make an election after weighing his options, as he acknowledged that the case was against him and that he “may stand a better chance cooperating” with the relevant authorities to get a CSA. In the fourth paragraph, Noor also understood that even if he obtained a CSA, it was for the “judge to decide” if he could be considered as being merely a courier. Hence, it is clear that Mr Aw had never forced Noor to admit to knowledge of the drugs and that Noor made a strategic choice after weighing his options. Ultimately, Noor did not pursue his defence that he lacked knowledge of the drugs and contest the charge against him as he had expressly chosen to take on a different course, and not because Mr Aw repeatedly told him not to contest the case. As such, Noor’s allegation against Mr Aw on this score does not meet the first step of the two-step approach laid out in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid</span>. Mr Aw was not acting incompetently and did not wrongfully coerce Noor into abandoning a potentially viable defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In any event, I agree with the Prosecution that the further statement taken from Noor on 19 November 2018 (where Noor supposedly admitted to knowledge of the drugs) was not actually an admission as to the knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug in question, which is required to make out the offence.

</div> To make out the offence of drug importation under s 7 of the MDA, there must be knowledge of the nature of the drugs – which refers to “knowledge of the actual controlled drug referred to in the charge” (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Shafiq bin Shariff</span> [2021] 5 SLR 1317 at [15]). In the 19 November 2018 statement, Noor merely said that he saw Zaini taking out plastic bundles from a haversack containing a “brown substance” and Zaini told him that “it is drug[s] but never told [him] what kind of drugs”.

</div> In other words, this was not an admission as to the knowledge of the nature of drugs required for the offence. Noor also goes on to deny any involvement in the latter part of the statement.

</div> Thus, another aspect of the challenge to the advice given seemed to be that Mr Aw did not abide by the instructions given by Noor to raise this defence (which overlaps with the points made above). The difficulty I have with this contention is that the evidence before me fell short of showing that there was an adamant and unequivocal assertion of that at the material time by Noor to Mr Aw. What was on evidence pointed otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Prosecution highlights that the assisting counsel, Mr Mahadevan, supported Mr Aw’s version of events, and no evidence was given to undermine Mr Mahadevan’s evidence in this regard. Mr Mahadevan explained that they had always abided by the instructions of Noor. While Noor wanted to maintain the position denying knowledge of the drugs, Mr Aw and Mr Mahadevan were concerned about whether that position could be sustained as certain aspects of the statements given by Noor were incriminating.

</div> Further, Noor was very confident in holding on to that position as Zaini had allegedly promised him to inform the court and the investigation officers that Noor did not have knowledge of the drugs and the transactions.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my view, while Mr Aw and Mr Mahadevan did express their disquiet on the viability of the position that Noor was taking, as any reasonable and competent counsel might, nothing suggests that they did not follow Noor’s instructions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Furthermore, there was no settled conclusion after this. Mr Aw’s presentation of “Option A” and “Option B” to Noor as captured in the notes on 12 April 2018 was to highlight that there were two alternatives open to Noor – either to contest the charge or to co-operate. This was in accordance with Noor’s instructions as the option of contesting the charge was still on the table.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The other problem with this contention is that lawyers are not to be passive when engaging with their clients: they should not heedlessly follow what their clients say or want without further engaging with the matter. Counsel should advise, and in doing so, may disagree with the inclinations of their clients. Certainly, if the client were to insist, counsel may need to choose whether to abide by the wishes of their client or to discharge themselves. It must be remembered that the advocate is not merely the client’s unwitting or unthinking mouthpiece and should not be taking untenable positions that he cannot in good conscience advance, whilst hiding behind the veil of his client’s instructions (see <span class="font-italic">Prometheus Marine Pte Ltd v King, Ann Rita and another appeal</span> [2018] 1 SLR 1 at [70]). But until that point of final resolution is reached, it is expected that counsel would consider the law, the evidence, and weigh the likelihood of success.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I accept that, as observed from the 16 October 2018 written instructions, Mr Aw might have advised Noor that it may be better to co-operate given the merits of his case. I cannot see how else Noor could have come to the conclusion that he stood a better chance otherwise. But the suggestion of a better course to take is not the same as disregarding the client’s instructions. Here, while there did not appear to be extensive discussions about the viability of Noor’s defence, I cannot conclude that Mr Aw, in coming to the conclusion that he did that the interests of his client would be better served by co-operating with the authorities and avoiding the risks of challenging the Prosecution’s case, had fallen short of the required standard that applied under the first step in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid </span>(at [135]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The determination made by Mr Aw was one based on a proper assessment of the law and evidence. Mr Aw’s considerations were not wanting, as there was evidence from his perspective pointing to the possible guilt of Noor. These included the fact that the bundles of drugs were found in the vehicle that Noor was driving, with a co-accused that did not absolve him, and that Noor’s own statements suggested that he might have had knowledge of the drugs given his detailed involvement in the process. Furthermore, the excuse given that Noor thought that he was coming into Singapore to secure a job or get a possible share of Zaini’s winnings at the casino is a very thin reason.

Again, the standard applied is not whether the advice was objectively correct, but whether the conduct fell so far short of what was expected that it could be described as flagrant or egregious incompetence or indifference, and that a real possibility of a miscarriage of justice would result. If the accused’s counsel, in conducting a case, made a decision or took a course which later appeared to have been mistaken or unwise, that, generally speaking, has never been regarded as a proper ground of appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Juma’at bin Samad v Public Prosecutor</span> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 327 at [36]). In balancing whether or not adverse inferences would be drawn against the accused, or whether exposure to cross-examination would worsen the accused’s case, the court would not be overly astute in second-guessing the appropriate course of action taken by trial counsel, unless it is very clear that one course would be preferred in the discharge of the legal practitioner’s duty. This is not at all the case here. As will be discussed further below, Noor’s case in the present remitted hearing, in reality, hinges on the fact that his case could have been defended. That is not enough. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Not visiting or consulting Noor earlier</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Court of Appeal noted that the allegation of insufficient frequency of visits by Mr Aw was rejected as there was evidence to show that Mr Aw had made a number of attempts to visit Noor and did in fact visit Noor on a number of occasions.

</div> Further, Mr Aw did not keep Noor reasonably informed about what went on during the pre-trial conferences. The Defence argues that this conduct was in breach of r 5(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the PCR, which requires a legal practitioner to “keep the client reasonably informed of the progress of the client’s matter” and amounts to unreasonable conduct.

</div> these are matters of substance for the Court of Appeal to assess; and I will not go further into them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It is only if the propositions of law were so clear and unambiguous, that no reasonable assessment would have pointed to the advice given by the trial counsel, that it could be concluded that an injustice would occur. Legal advice must of necessity point to a particular course of action whilst forsaking others, and choices have to be made. It is not enough to establish injustice by showing that a possible line of defence not pursued (if it was properly considered) was the better one, or that there was a possibility that his current defence could have been raised or made out. It must be remembered that legitimate and reasonable strategic or tactical decisions do not come within the very narrow class of cases where inadequate assistance of counsel can be said to have occurred (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid </span>at [135]). Accordingly, the Defence must show that either that the trial counsel ignored instructions (which had not been proven), or that the trial counsel clearly failed the objective standard showing egregious incompetence or indifference. It is always easy to comment on what could have been done better with the full benefit of hindsight and upon further reflection (<span class="font-italic">see Nazeri bin Lajim v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] SGCA 41 at [29]). But as long as counsel has acted in accordance with the client’s instructions and their duty to the court, then they must be given deference in the assessment of how to conduct the case (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid </span>at [135]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 There is also no duty on the part of counsel to ensure that the accused is not in a quandary or has no uncertainty as to the course of action. It may be of little comfort to the client, but all litigation carries uncertainty and risk. The lawyer can only advise, but cannot eliminate that uncertainty or remove it from the mind of the client. When a lawyer makes an assessment on how to conduct the case, the relative risks and consequences would have to be taken into account as well. Where a capital sentence may be imposed, the risk of a conviction that warrants the death sentence must feature in the deliberation and advice. That no doubt is part and parcel of the current regime – those who are accused of capital drug offences must weigh the consequences of not rendering co-operation to the relevant authorities and forgo the possibility of obtaining a CSA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether there was an inducement, threat or promise made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Noor alleges that IO Prashant had asked him to admit that he knew that Zaini had brought drugs into Singapore, and that if Noor did not admit, he would be sentenced to hang while Zaini would be released.

</div> This goes against the grain of most allegations of inducement, threat or promise, which involves the giving of a false admission to escape such pressure, resulting in an involuntary statement being made. The relevant law relating to such allegations is captured in s 258(3) of the CPC which provides that “the court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused” if the making of the statement appears to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. The section requires that the alleged inducement, threat or promise must have caused the accused to make the statement. I cannot see how Noor’s allegation fits into this provision. The issue would be moot if the inducement, threat or promise did not even operate on Noor and give rise to those impugned statements recorded by IO Prashant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Court of Appeal had elaborated upon the relevant principles when assessing the admissibility of a statement under s 258(3) of the CPC in <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 557 at [39]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 … The first stage considers objectively whether any inducement, threat or promise was made.

The test for oppression was whether the accused’s mind and will was sapped such that he spoke when he otherwise would have remained silent (<span class="font-italic">Tey Tsun Hang v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1189 at [113]). In the present case, Noor’s free will cannot be said to be sapped, as Noor did not give in to the alleged inducement, threat or promise from IO Prashant but was instead, placed in a “dilemma”. In any case, this is not a typical situation of oppression which concerns whether the nature, duration or other attendant circumstances of the investigations was oppressive. Again, I cannot see how this allegation against IO Prashant is of any legal relevance then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In any event, since serious allegations have been made against IO Prashant, their veracity will need to be considered.

Further, this one-sided recounting by Noor of the supposed threat to his trial counsel is also rather belated and unconvincing as a significant period of time had passed since then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In any event, I find that what was recorded in the attendance note was simply the laying out of the consequences by IO Prashant to Noor, including the possible punishments involving the death penalty. Even if this laying out of consequences was seen as an exhortation to tell the truth or to admit (when combined with the suggestion that Noor “must be guilty”), such an exhortation must be assessed according to the part objective and part subjective test in determining voluntariness (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Thian Lai v Public Prosecutor</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 319 at [18]). As reiterated earlier, there was (as accepted by Noor himself), no effect of whatever alleged inducement, threat or promise made as it did not subjectively operate on his mind. In the final analysis, regardless of what IO Prashant had allegedly uttered to Noor, it is clear that there were no admissions by Noor in the statements recorded by IO Prashant on 5 November 2015 as noted above at [101].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Influencing the effect of the alleged lack of proper advice </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Noor makes a rather unorthodox argument – that even if there were no involuntary statements made by Noor, this was the backdrop against which bad advice was given by his trial counsel. However, it is hard to see how this backdrop could have influenced the outcome. If anything, it would have actually reinforced the conclusion that in the face of the thorough investigations by the police, and the position taken by Zaini, it was entirely reasonable for Mr Aw to have concluded that the best option for Noor was to co-operate with the authorities and obtain a CSA in the hopes of possibly averting capital punishment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In conclusion, the additional evidence received as regards the allegations made by Noor against his counsel at the trial, as well as against the investigation officer, do not show any basis to revisit the conclusion reached that Noor should be convicted of the charge against him.
