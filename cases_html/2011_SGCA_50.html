        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Before us are two appeals, Civil Appeal
                    No 177 of 2010 (“CA 177”) and Civil Appeal No 184
                    of 2010 (“CA 184”) (collectively, “the present
                    appeals”). CA 177 is an appeal by E C Investment Holding
                    Pte Ltd (“ECI”) against the decision of the High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”) in <em>E C Investment
                        Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and
                        another, interveners)</em> [2011] 2 SLR 232 (“the
                    Judgment”), where the Judge dismissed ECI’s application in
                    Originating Summons No 1357 of 2009 (“OS 1357”) for, in
                    the main, specific performance of an agreement for the sale of 39A Ridout
                    Road, Singapore 248438 (“the Property”) to it at the price of
                    $20m. CA 184 is an appeal by Ridout Residence Pte Ltd
                    (“Ridout”) against, essentially, the Judge’s refusal,
                    following his dismissal of ECI’s claim, to award damages for consequential
                    losses suffered by Ridout. ECI (the appellant in CA 177) is the first
                    respondent in CA 184, while Ridout (the appellant in CA 184) is the
                    first respondent in CA 177.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The other parties to the present appeals
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     the second respondent in both
                        appeals, Hong Leong Finance Limited (“HLF”), which is the
                        registered mortgagee of the Property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     the third respondent in both appeals, Orion Oil Limited
                        (“Orion”), which had granted a $10m loan to Anwar secured by a
                        charge registered against Ridout in respect of the remainder of the proceeds
                        of sale of the Property after satisfaction of HLF’s prior interest;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     the fourth
                        respondent in both appeals, Mr Thomas Chan Ho Lam (“Thomas
                        Chan”), who was granted an option by Ridout to purchase the Property
                        at the price of $37m after ECI had exercised its earlier option to purchase
                        the Property at the price of $20m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The material facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The circumstances in which ECI came to be interested in the
                Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 2006, the Property, which has a land area of
                    about 40,600 sq ft, was purchased by Ridout for $28m. Ridout held the
                    Property on trust for its sole shareholder and director, one Mr Angus Anwar
                    (“Anwar”). To effect the purchase, Anwar used $17m out of a total
                    loan of $30m from HLF secured by a mortgage over the Property. In 2008, Anwar
                    obtained a further loan of $10m from Orion secured by a charge registered
                    against Ridout in respect of the balance of the proceeds of sale of the
                    Property, <em>ie</em>, subject to the prior claim of
                    HLF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Between March and May 2009, HLF pressed Anwar
                    for repayment to reduce the loan. In an attempt to stave off a mortgagee’s
                    sale of the Property, Anwar made partial repayment of around $2m to HLF. In May
                    2009, HLF sought further repayment from Anwar so as to reduce the then
                    outstanding loan of approximately $19.6m to $18m. Anwar then tried to obtain
                    loans from friends and personal contacts. At the time, Anwar obtained a
                    valuation of the Property from Colliers International Consultancy &amp;
                    Valuation (Singapore) Pte Ltd dated 15 April 2009 (“the Colliers
                    Report”), which gave the Property an open market value of $29m and a
                    forced sale value of $23.2m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Among the people whom Anwar contacted was one
                    Mr Ivan Lim, who was given a copy of the Colliers Report. Ivan Lim in turn
                    approached, <em>inter alia</em>, one Mr Lim Swee Hoe
                    (“SH Lim”), who was a director of SHL Realty Pte Ltd and who
                    was shown the Colliers Report. We should at this juncture note that of the
                    people whom Ivan Lim approached, none was interested in giving a loan to Anwar,
                    although some were open to the idea of buying over the Property. SH Lim
                    then approached one Mr Tan Koo Chuan (“KC Tan”) and one
                    Mr Melvin Poh (“Poh”), who were the shareholders and
                    directors of ECI. SH Lim showed KC Tan and Poh the Colliers Report. As
                    ECI is a property developer, KC Tan and Poh were not interested in granting
                    a loan. However, SH Lim also told KC Tan and Poh that Anwar (acting
                    through Ridout) was prepared to sell the Property, but that the buyer must be
                    willing to pay $2m upfront. To that, KC Tan and Poh indicated their
                    interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The preparatory work for the transaction relating to the
                Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As a result, ECI engaged Mr Lee Chow Soon
                    (“CS Lee”) of M/s Tan Lee &amp; Partners
                    (“TLP”) and Ridout instructed Mr Low Yew Shen
                    (“YS Low”) of Ng Chong &amp; Hue LLC (“NCH”) to
                    prepare the documentation to effect the transaction between ECI and Ridout
                    (“the Transaction”). On 2 June 2009, YS Low sent
                    CS Lee an e-mail headed “Sale and Purchase of Ridout Road (Subject
                    to Contract)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> forwarding a
                    statement of accounts showing the outstanding amount owed by Anwar to HLF as at
                    31 May 2009. On 3 June 2009, CS Lee responded enclosing a draft
                    option to purchase (“the Draft Option”) as well as a draft deed of
                    settlement (“the Draft Deed”) for YS Low’s comments.
                    The Draft Option stipulated a purchase price of $20m for the Property and an
                    option fee of $2m. As for the Draft Deed, it provided, in essence, that
                    “within 60 days from today”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    the seller (<em>ie</em>, Ridout) had the right to cancel
                    the option granted to the purchaser (<em>ie</em>, ECI) by
                    refunding the option fee of $2m plus making an additional lump sum payment of
                    $250,000 –
                    <em>ie</em>, by paying a total sum of $2.25m to ECI –
                    by way of a cashier’s order. On 4 June 2009, YS Low responded
                    with the comment that “the drafts [were] subject to any further changes
                    [his] clients [might] wish to make”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The meeting on 5 June 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 5 June 2009, a meeting attended by
                    KC Tan, Poh, Anwar, YS Low, CS Lee, one George Samuel Panthradil
                    (“Panthradil”), the chief financial officer of another company
                    owned by Anwar, and SH Lim was held at TLP’s office. At this meeting
                    (“the 5 June 2009 meeting”), CS Lee produced a
                    litigation search done on Anwar on the same day (<em>ie</em>, on 5 June 2009) which showed numerous actions against
                    the latter. CS Lee, KC Tan and Poh said that in view of the litigation
                    search, there was a significant credit risk for ECI in going ahead with the
                    Transaction. There was then a separate breakout meeting between KC Tan, Poh
                    and Anwar, at which KC Tan and Poh told Anwar that they were willing to pay
                    only $1.5m as the option fee, instead of $2m as stated in the Draft Option.
                    Faced with those circumstances, Anwar agreed to reduce the option fee to
                    $1.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The outcome of the 5 June 2009 meeting was
                    that Ridout granted an option dated 5 June 2009 to ECI to purchase the
                    Property at the price of $20m in consideration of an option fee of $1.5m
                    (“the First Option”). A deed of settlement between ECI and Ridout
                    (“the Deed of Settlement”) was also executed on 5 June 2009,
                    but it was post-dated to 8 June 2009. Under the terms of the Deed of
                    Settlement, Ridout had the right, “within 60 days from
                        today”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> to cancel the First Option by
                    refunding the option fee of $1.5m and paying an additional sum of $180,000
                    (“the $180,000 compensation fee”) to “compensate
                        [ECI]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> –
                    <em>ie</em>, by paying an aggregate amount of $1.68m
                    (“the $1.68m”) to ECI – by way of a cashier’s order.
                    If this right of cancellation was not exercised by Ridout within the stipulated
                    60-day period (“the 60-Day Period”), ECI would be entitled to
                    exercise the First Option during the 30-day period thereafter. Following the
                    grant of the First Option, ECI lodged a caveat against the Property on
                    5 June 2009. At this juncture, we would note that the sale price of $20m
                    was $3.2m below the forced sale value placed on the Property by the Colliers
                    Report. We should also add that although the Property was ostensibly to be sold
                    by Ridout, which was its registered proprietor, it was effectively Anwar
                    (Ridout’s sole shareholder and director) who was the directing mind behind
                    the sale. We will thus, in this judgment, refer to Ridout and Anwar
                    interchangeably as the vendor of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The parties’ solicitors, by way of a fax
                    from NCH to TLP dated 5 August 2009, agreed that the 60-Day Period for
                    Ridout to cancel the First Option would end on 6 August 2009 (as the Judge
                    noted at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> of the Judgment, this fax was
                    most likely sent due to the ambiguity as to whether the 60-Day Period, which was
                    expressed as “60 days from today”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> in
                    cl B(a) of the Deed of Settlement, meant 60 days from 5 June 2009 (the
                    date on which the Deed of Settlement was actually signed) or 60 days from
                    8 June 2009 (the date of execution stated in the Deed of Settlement)). No
                    cancellation was effected by Ridout during the 60-Day Period. However, on
                    7 August 2009, NCH, on behalf of Ridout, wrote to TLP tendering a Maybank
                    cheque (as opposed to a cashier’s order) for the $1.68m “as payment
                    for cancellation of the [First] Option”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> On
                    11 August 2009 (which was the next working day following the National Day
                    weekend), TLP wrote to NCH returning the Maybank cheque and rejecting
                    Ridout’s purported cancellation of the First Option on the grounds that
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) the purported cancellation had
                    been effected out of time. Equally pertinent to note is that Anwar admitted in
                    evidence that the Maybank cheque would have been dishonoured had it been
                    presented for payment as there were insufficient funds in the relevant bank
                    account at that time to honour that cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Following his failure to have the First Option
                    cancelled, Anwar sought to persuade ECI not to exercise that option by offering
                    to pay a higher cancellation fee. Nevertheless, on 27 August 2009, ECI
                    exercised the First Option and lodged a second caveat against the Property
                    stating its interest as being that of a “purchaser”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> On the evening of the same day, Anwar
                    sent SMS messages to KC Tan and Poh alleging that the Transaction was an
                    illegal moneylending transaction and stating that he would be lodging a police
                    report, which he duly did on 29 August 2009. Interestingly, in his police
                    report, Anwar did not specifically complain about illegal moneylending, but only
                    stated that ECI was “trying to make more money out of the
                        deal”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> as a result of the escalation
                    in the price of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The alleged settlement in September 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Further discussions between Anwar on one part
                    and KC Tan and Poh on the other took place. Notably, there is a dispute as
                    to whether a settlement was in fact reached between them on 3 September
                    2009. The alleged settlement (“the September 2009 Settlement”) was
                    that upon Ridout paying a sum of $3.5m (which included the refund of the $1.5m
                    option fee) to ECI, the sale of the Property to ECI would be cancelled and
                    Ridout could sell the Property to another person. The Judge found that there was
                    indeed such a settlement agreement (see [85] of the Judgment). Be that as it may, no payment was made by
                    Anwar pursuant to the September 2009 Settlement. Instead, on 16 September
                    2009, Ridout sent a letter (signed by Anwar) to ECI headed “Sale of
                    39A Ridout Road Singapore 248438”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> in which Ridout asked for the
                    release of $1m to it on that very day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Thomas Chan’s involvement with the Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 6 October 2009, Thomas Chan learnt
                    from his property agent, Kelvin Tan, that the Property was available for sale.
                    Kelvin Tan had been alerted to the availability of the Property by Anwar’s
                    private banker, Amy Tee. Thomas Chan, after viewing the Property on
                    7 October 2009, was interested in purchasing it despite being told that it
                    was “hotly contested” (see [147] of the Judgment). Thomas Chan
                    agreed to purchase the Property for $37m, with $1m as the option fee. In
                    addition, he agreed to make a payment of $850,000 (the remainder of the first 5%
                    of the purchase price of $37m) upon exercising his option. An option on these
                    terms (“the Second Option”) was granted by Ridout to Thomas Chan
                    on 7 October 2009. Without undertaking any preliminary searches on the
                    Property, Thomas Chan paid $1m for the Second Option on 8 October 2009.
                    Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP, which was later engaged by Thomas Chan to act for him
                    in the purchase of the Property, conducted a search and informed him (on
                    19 October 2009, almost two weeks after he paid the option fee) of the two
                    caveats lodged by ECI against the Property. Following his inquiries, Kelvin Tan
                    was told by Amy Tee that ECI and Ridout had resolved their differences and that
                    ECI would be withdrawing its caveats. On 20 October 2009, Thomas Chan
                    lodged a caveat against the Property. On 6 November 2009, he exercised the
                    Second Option by paying $850,000 to Ridout and lodged a further caveat against
                    the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The settlement in November 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 3 November 2009, in conducting a
                    routine search on the Property, ECI discovered the caveat lodged by Thomas Chan
                    on 20 October 2009 after he was granted the Second Option. ECI raised its
                    objection to the Second Option and warned Ridout that it would apply to court
                    for specific performance of the First Option. Subsequently, on 11 November
                    2009, a settlement between Ridout and ECI was reached as reflected in the
                    correspondence between TLP and Ridout’s new solicitors, JLC Advisors LLP
                    (“JLC”). Under this settlement (“the November 2009
                    Settlement”), Ridout was to pay ECI $5m by way of a cashier’s order
                    by noon on 16 November 2009, whereupon ECI would cancel its purchase of the
                    Property and withdraw the two caveats which it had lodged. Should Ridout fail to
                    make the stipulated payment, ECI would proceed with the purchase of the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Pursuant to the November 2009 Settlement, on
                    13 November 2009, TLP sent JLC a draft notice of withdrawal of caveat for
                    the latter’s review. On the same day, Clifford Chance Pte Ltd, which was
                    also acting for Thomas Chan in relation to his purchase of the Property,
                    informed KC Tan and Poh that Ridout had granted the Second Option to Thomas
                    Chan in respect of the Property and sought confirmation that ECI would not be
                    proceeding with its purchase of the Property. KC Tan and Poh did not give
                    the confirmation requested for as, at that time, they had yet to receive the $5m
                    payment due from Ridout under the November 2009 Settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The filing of OS 1357</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 16 November 2009, JLC wrote to TLP
                    asking for a short postponement to 18 November 2009 for Ridout to make the
                    $5m payment pursuant to the November 2009 Settlement. ECI refused to further
                    negotiate the matter and filed OS 1357 (the originating action in the court
                    below) praying for, <em>inter alia</em>, specific
                    performance of “the agreement between the parties as evinced by [the
                    First Option] granted by [Ridout] and exercised by [ECI] on 27 August 2009
                    for the sale and purchase of the [P]roperty”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    [emphasis in bold in original omitted]. For ease of reference, this agreement
                    will hereafter be termed “the Sale Agreement”. HLF was cited as
                    the second defendant. Both Orion and Thomas Chan intervened in the proceedings,
                    and Thomas Chan expressly asked for specific performance of the Second
                    Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the court below, the parties’
                    arguments centred on what the true nature of the Transaction was and whether, if
                    it was indeed a genuine agreement for the sale of the Property by Ridout to ECI,
                    the latter should be granted specific performance. In addition, issues relating
                    to illegality, fraud, duress, unconscionability and inducement of breach of
                    contract were raised. As those issues are immaterial to the present appeals for
                    the reason stated at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> below, we will
                    confine ourselves to discussing the Judge’s decision on the true nature of
                    the Transaction and the grant (or refusal) of specific performance to
                    ECI.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The true nature of the Transaction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the Judgment at [71], the Judge came to the conclusion that
                    the Transaction, as set out in the First Option and the Deed of Settlement
                    (collectively, “the Two Instruments”), was in truth “a loan
                    with security, the security being the Property”. The Judge’s
                    decision was based on the following considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     First, although the Two Instruments were
                    executed on the same day (<em>viz</em>, 5 June 2009),
                    the Deed of Settlement was dated three days later (<em>viz</em>, 8 June 2009) to give the impression that it was a
                    subsequent agreement (see [70] of the
                    Judgment). Second, CS Lee, who drafted the Two Instruments, agreed that the
                    Transaction was an unusual one and that he “had not done this kind of
                    deal before” (see <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a> of the
                    Judgment). Third, the First Option contained a number of unusual features,
                    namely: (a) the option fee of $1.5m was much higher than the usual option
                    fee of 1% of the purchase price (which would have been $200,000, based on the
                    purchase price of $20m offered to ECI); (b) the option period was some
                    three months, much longer than the usual period of two to four weeks;
                    (c) the purchase price of $20m stated in the First Option had no relation
                    to the true value of the Property; and (d) no further payment needed to be
                    made by ECI if it exercised the First Option (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> (at sub-para (a) thereof), [72] and [77] of the Judgment). Fourth, the Judge found KC Tan and
                    Poh to be unreliable witnesses and did not accept their evidence that ECI had
                    only intended to buy the Property (see [74] of the Judgment). Fifth, before ECI exercised the First
                    Option, the parties were attempting to reach a settlement so that ECI would not
                    exercise the option at all (see [84] of
                    the Judgment). In the Judge’s view, this indicated that ECI was not
                    genuinely interested in purchasing the Property. Sixth, the Judge took into
                    account the parties’ subsequent conduct in continuing to negotiate to seek
                    a settlement after Ridout failed to comply with the terms of the September 2009
                    Settlement, and ECI’s failure to take any action to complete the purchase
                    of the Property (<em>eg</em>, by obtaining financing for
                    the purchase, making the requisite legal requisitions, <em>etc</em>). In this regard, the Judge was conscious that the question
                    of whether the subsequent conduct of contracting parties could be relied on to
                    construe a contract was still a matter of some controversy (see [79] of the Judgment). He underlined that he
                    was not relying on the parties’ subsequent conduct in the present case to
                    construe the Two Instruments, but “to see how they implemented or treated
                    the [Two Instruments]” (see likewise [79] of the Judgment). He added that the parties’
                    subsequent conduct was germane to the issues of waiver and estoppel, which were
                    in turn relevant in determining whether, if the Transaction was indeed for the
                    sale of the Property to ECI, ECI should be granted specific performance (see
                        [79], [116] and [120] of the
                    Judgment). Seventh, the Judge pointed out that in late September 2009, Ridout
                    was earnestly looking for a new buyer for the Property. Despite being kept
                    informed of this development, ECI did not object (see [88] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether specific performance of the Sale Agreement should be
                granted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Judge went on to hold that even if the
                    Transaction was indeed for the sale of the Property by Ridout to ECI, following
                    the authorities from Canada and New Zealand, this would not be an appropriate
                    case to grant ECI specific performance of the Sale Agreement (as defined at
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above) for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     ECI “[was] not holding the
                        land for personal enjoyment but [for] the profit derivable therefrom”
                        (see [108] of the
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Damages
                        would be an adequate remedy for ECI (see [109]–[110]
                        of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     ECI had not come to court with “clean hands” (see
                            [114] of the Judgment) in that:
                        (i) the sale price of the Property was clearly below its true value;
                        (ii) the witnesses for ECI were less than truthful in their evidence to
                        the court; and (iii) the grant of specific performance would cause
                        severe hardship to Ridout.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     In view of the September 2009 Settlement and the November
                        2009 Settlement, it was clear that ECI’s intention was to get a higher
                        amount of compensation from Ridout in return for not holding Ridout to the
                        First Option (see [115] of the Judgment). If ECI had acceded to
                        Ridout’s request for an extension of just two days from
                        16 November 2009 to 18 November 2009 to make the $5m payment due
                        under the November 2009 Settlement, the present dispute would not have
                        arisen. ECI did not agree to the two-day extension because it noticed that
                        property prices had risen significantly.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     There was estoppel by acquiescence in that ECI,
                        by its conduct after 11 August 2009 (the day on which ECI rejected
                        Ridout’s purported cancellation of the First Option), “clearly
                        led [Anwar] to believe that it agreed, for a higher
                        ‘compensation’, to allow [Ridout] to look for another buyer and
                        … would not proceed to complete the purchase of the Property”
                        (see [120] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues raised in the present appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the court below, issues on duress,
                    unconscionability and illegal moneylending were raised by Ridout to resist
                    ECI’s application in OS 1357, while issues on fraudulent trading
                    and/or inducement of breach of contract were raised by Orion. The Judge ruled on
                    all those issues. In the present appeals, none of the parties are challenging
                    the Judge’s decision on those issues. Thus, they are deemed to have
                    accepted the Judge’s decision in those respects (see O 57 r 3(2)
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It follows that the present appeals hinge on
                    only two core issues, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Judge was right in
                        regarding the Transaction, as set out in the Two Instruments, as purely a
                        loan coupled with security (“the First Main Issue”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     if the
                        Judge erred in his ruling on the First Main Issue (<em>ie</em>, if the Transaction was truly for the sale of the
                        Property by Ridout to ECI), whether ECI should be denied specific
                        performance of the Sale Agreement and be awarded only damages (“the
                        Second Main Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The First Main Issue: The true nature of the Transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    First Main Issue, the Judge, in coming to his conclusion that the Transaction
                    (as structured in the form of the Two Instruments) was in truth a loan coupled
                    with security, considered not only the terms of the said instruments, but also
                    the oral evidence of the witnesses. In the next few sections (<em>viz</em>, at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>–<a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> below), we will set out briefly the arguments
                    of the respective parties in support of or against (as the case may be) the
                    Judge’s finding on the First Main Issue. In this regard, we will first
                    provide an overview of the respective parties’ cases on this issue before
                    going into the specific matters which they raised. It would be pertinent, at
                    this juncture, to note the following features of the Transaction (as highlighted
                    by counsel for Thomas Chan):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     The option fee of $1.5m paid by ECI
                        to Ridout for the First Option was unusually large. It worked out to 7.5% of
                        the stated purchase price of $20m, well above the market norm of
                    1%.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     To accommodate
                        the 60-Day Period during which Ridout could cancel the First Option, the
                        validity period of the option was lengthened to 90 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     The cancellation of the First Option
                        was conditional upon Ridout paying ECI the $180,000 compensation fee, which
                        was (so counsel submitted) essentially “interest” payable on
                        the 60-day “loan” of the $1.5m option fee at the rate of 6%
                        per month or 72% per annum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview of the respective parties’ cases on the First Main
                Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Ridout, Orion and Thomas Chan (hereafter
                    collectively referred to as “the three respondents”), whose
                    interests on the First Main Issue are similar and/or aligned (albeit not
                    identically), emphasised that an appellate court should be slow to overturn a
                    trial judge’s findings, in particular, those findings of fact which hinge
                    upon the credibility and veracity of witnesses (see <em>Lim Hwee
                        Meng v Citadel Investment Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 101 at
                        [26]–[27]). Of course, they also recognised that an
                    appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to evaluate and draw
                    proper inferences from primary facts (see <em>Peh Eng Leng v Pek
                        Eng Leong</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 939). They underscored, in
                    particular, the following factual findings of the Judge:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     KC Tan was an unreliable
                        witness as he feigned ignorance of many things. He gave answers that would
                        suit his purpose and was combative on the stand (see [74] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Poh was also found to be an unreliable
                        witness, especially in relation to his evidence on ECI’s intentions at
                            (<em>inter alia</em>) the 5 June 2009 meeting
                        (see [74] and [83] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     CS Lee was evasive and combative
                        in putting forward the case for his client (ECI) and in explaining why he
                        structured the Transaction in the form of the Two Instruments (see [70] of the Judgment). (It should,
                        however, be noted that the Judge also expressly stated that CS Lee
                        “did not cross the line” (see [70] of the Judgment) while giving evidence, and that his
                        evasive and combative attitude was “more in the spirit of putting
                        forward the best case for his client and defending his part in the
                        structuring of the deal” (see [70] of the Judgment).)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     Two of ECI’s witnesses (<em>ie</em>, CS Lee and SH Lim) were graphically described
                        by the Judge as being “like sharks circling around bleeding prey,
                        opportunistically [making] a claim when there was no basis to do so”
                        (see [29] of the
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     Ridout’s key witness, Anwar, was not dishonest, although his account
                        of the events leading to the 5 June 2009 meeting was
                        “contradictory and hopelessly tangled” (see [32] of the Judgment) as he was “a
                        ‘big picture’ man who did not pay attention to details”
                        (see [32] of the
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As the Judge found that both KC Tan and
                    Poh lacked credibility as witnesses, the three respondents submitted that
                    Anwar’s evidence should be preferred over that of the said two persons, in
                    particular, in ascertaining the parties’ intention at the time of
                    executing the Two Instruments during the 5 June 2009 meeting as well as at
                    the time of the events surrounding the September 2009 Settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In contrast, ECI’s submission on the
                    First Main Issue was, in brief, as follows. The Judge, it was argued, erred in
                    reading too much into the Two Instruments when they clearly reflected two
                    different but connected ideas, namely: Ridout was to sell the Property to ECI,
                    but with the proviso that Ridout could cancel the First Option within the 60-Day
                    Period by paying ECI the $1.68m (<em>viz</em>, the $1.5m
                    option fee plus the $180,000 compensation fee). Admittedly, it could not be
                    disputed, and we agree with the Judge, that Anwar was not keen to sell the
                    Property, but was only interested in obtaining a loan. On the other hand, ECI,
                    being a property developer, did not really want to lend money, but only wanted
                    to buy the Property. ECI submitted that the Transaction, as structured in the
                    form of the Two Instruments, was meant to meet the different needs and interests
                    of itself and Anwar (acting via Ridout), and that it was no less an agreement
                    for the sale of the Property by Ridout to ECI, subject to Ridout’s right
                    of cancellation within the 60-Day Period. The Judge’s approach, ECI
                    contended, undermined commercial certainty, bearing in mind that the Two
                    Instruments had been negotiated and accepted by the parties with professional
                    advice and in the presence of their respective solicitors. ECI submitted that
                    the court should not be overly zealous to rewrite an arrangement for contracting
                    parties. ECI also emphasised the following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     There was no evidence that the
                        Transaction (as structured in the form of the Two Instruments), which was
                        for the sale of the Property by Ridout to ECI subject to Ridout’s
                        right of cancellation, was a sham transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     Although Anwar initially wanted only a loan, he
                        was prepared to sell the Property. The Judge erred in ignoring clear
                        evidence that Anwar (and in turn, Ridout) regarded the Transaction as a sale
                        of the Property to ECI, and not wholly as a secured loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Judge erred in ignoring critical
                        pieces of objective documentary evidence which showed that Ridout did not
                        treat the sale of the Property to ECI as having been cancelled or as having
                        been varied by settlement or acquiescence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Specific matters raised by the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The proper approach in characterising a transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We turn now to the specific matters which the
                    parties raised in respect of the Judge’s ruling that the Transaction was
                    in truth a secured loan, beginning with their submissions on the proper approach
                    to take in characterising a transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     ECI submitted that in characterising a
                    transaction, where there was no evidence either that the real agreement reached
                    between the parties was wholly different from the agreement recorded in the
                    documents before the court or that there was an independent contract existing
                    outside of the documents before the court, the usual approach employed by the
                    court was to “look at the documents themselves to ascertain the nature
                    and substance of the transaction” (see <em>Thai Chee Ken
                        and others (Liquidators of Pan-Electric Industries Ltd) v Banque
                        Paribas</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 871 (“<em>Thai
                        Chee Ken</em>”) at [9]).
                    ECI further submitted that if the allegation was that the transaction in
                    question was a sham, the threshold needed to discharge the (civil) burden of
                    proof was high, <em>ie</em>, the party alleging that it
                    ought not be bound by the terms of the documents setting out the transaction
                    (the “transaction documents”) must show (on a balance of
                    probabilities) that “all the parties [to the transaction] … ha[d]
                    a common intention that the acts [done] or documents [executed were] not to
                    create the legal rights and obligations which they [gave] the appearance of
                    creating” (see the English Court of Appeal case of <em>Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd</em> [1967] 2 QB
                    786 at 802, which was quoted with approval by our High Court in <em>TKM (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Export Credit Insurance Corp of Singapore
                        Ltd</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 858 at [48]). ECI pointed out that in the present case, there was no
                    evidence of any collective intention on the part of itself and Ridout to
                    deceive. Significantly, the Judge did not call the Transaction a sham. ECI
                    argued that the Judge’s finding that the Transaction was nothing but a
                    secured loan was contrary to the weight of evidence which showed that the
                    Transaction was for the sale of the Property by Ridout to ECI, subject only to
                    the reservation that Ridout could cancel the First Option by paying the $1.68m
                    within the 60-Day Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Ridout, on the other hand, argued that the
                    case of <em>Thai Chee Ken</em> should be distinguished on
                    its facts. In <em>Thai Chee Ken</em>, there was no
                    suggestion by the parties that the sale and purchase agreements in question were
                    a sham or a disguise. There was also no evidence that the real agreement reached
                    between the parties was different from that recorded in the documents. As such,
                    the court only looked at the documents themselves to ascertain the nature and
                    substance of the transaction. In stark contrast, Ridout’s position in the
                    present matter had always been that contrary to the labels used in the Two
                    Instruments, the Transaction was a loan by ECI to Anwar secured by the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On his part, Thomas Chan argued that the
                    question of whether the Transaction was a sham did not arise as what the court
                    was being asked to determine was the true nature of the Transaction. On this,
                    the Judge had made the specific finding that the Transaction was a (disguised)­
                    loan with security. Thomas Chan highlighted that in the Australian case of
                        <em>Gurfinkel and another v Bentley Proprietary
                        Limited</em> (1966) 116 CLR 98 (also referred to in <em>Thai Chee Ken</em> at [11]), the High Court of Australia stated (at 114) that
                    “if it [could] be shewn by parol evidence that both parties to a document
                    adopted the form they did as a disguise, then their true intent and not the form
                    [would] prevail”. This, Thomas Chan submitted, was precisely the position
                    here: there was ample evidence in the instant case, from both the
                    contemporaneous documents and the witnesses’ testimony, that the real
                    agreement reached between the parties was wholly different from the (ostensible)
                    agreement reflected by the labels attached to the Two Instruments. Hence,
                    according to Thomas Chan, there was no basis for the application of <em>Thai Chee Ken</em> to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We recognise that the court is not prohibited
                    from evaluating evidence <em>other than</em> the
                    transaction documents (<em>ie</em>, the Two Instruments in
                    the present case) to determine the true nature of a transaction. In other words,
                    the crux of the First Main Issue lies not in construing the wording or terms
                    used in the Two Instruments <em>per se</em>, but in
                    determining whether the real agreement between the parties was that expressed in
                    those instruments. If the parties had adopted the arrangement set out in the Two
                    Instruments as a disguise for what was truly a loan, then their true intent, and
                    not the form of the Two Instruments, will prevail, as stated in <em>Thai Chee Ken</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In this regard, the case of <em>City Hardware Pte Ltd v Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 733 (“<em>City Hardware</em>”)
                    is pertinent. In that case, the court outlined the approach which should be
                    taken in analysing whether a transaction was a disguised moneylending
                    transaction or a genuine commercial transaction of a different nature, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    ... What constitutes lending must of course remain
                            a question of fact in every case. <em>Careful
                                consideration has to be given to the form and substance of the
                                transaction as well as the parties’ position and relationship
                                in the context of the entire factual matrix</em>. It is
                            axiomatic that if there has been no lending there can be no
                            moneylending.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    It ought to be stressed, however, that <em>the court ought not to be overzealous in analysing or
                                deconstructing a transaction in order to infer and/or conclude that
                                the object of the transaction was to lend money</em>.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the present case, it is true that the form
                    and structure of the documentation for the Transaction, with the cancellation
                    feature in the Deed of Settlement, was ECI’s creation. It was probably the
                    case that because KC Tan and Poh knew that Anwar/Ridout was reluctant to
                    sell the Property, they came up with the idea of effecting the Transaction by
                    way of two separate instruments (<em>viz</em>, the First
                    Option and the Deed of Settlement) under which Ridout would give ECI an option
                    (via the First Option) to purchase the Property at the price of $20m while
                    reserving for itself (via the Deed of Settlement) the right to cancel the option
                    within the 60-Day Period. As we see it, there was no reason for CS Lee to
                    structure the Transaction in this manner other than to meet the concerns of both
                    his client (ECI) and those of Anwar/Ridout.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In this regard, CS Lee stated in his
                    evidence that he had merely prepared the Two Instruments to reflect what ECI
                        wanted:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Right. So your input was really very mechanical:
                            you received their instructions, you were told what the structure was,
                            so all that you needed to do was to make sure that the documents
                            reflected what they wanted?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It cannot be denied that the fact that the
                    Deed of Settlement was post-dated to a date after the date stated on the First
                    Option (the First Option being dated 5 June 2009 and the Deed of
                    Settlement, 8 June 2009 (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above))
                    would give the misleading impression that the agreement set out in the Deed of
                    Settlement was reached subsequent to the agreement set out in the First Option.
                    CS Lee admitted as much. He also admitted that based on his more than 25
                    years of experience as a conveyancing lawyer, the Transaction was “an
                    unusual transaction”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> This shows that the
                    Transaction was not the normal or usual straightforward agreement for the sale
                    and purchase of property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the evidence of KC Tan and Poh, it is
                    clear that ECI wanted to purchase the Property at the most attractive price,
                    even though Anwar was not keen to sell. Due to Anwar’s financial
                    situation, KC Tan and Poh saw this as an opportunity to get a good deal.
                    This is evident from what Poh said in court:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... My question was this: would you agree with me
                            that the genesis of the [T]ransaction, the starting point, or the
                            motivation, I suppose, if you like, for the [T]ransaction, was because
                            … Anwar needed to raise money?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You would also agree with me that at the starting

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That was raised through [SH Lim], the agent,
                            that he was looking to borrow money, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">[Q.]</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So because of that, your understanding, as well
                            as [KC Tan]’s understanding was that … Anwar had an
                            urgent need to raise money?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Following from the above, Ridout submitted
                    that KC Tan and Poh entered into the Transaction because they realised that
                    this was the only way for ECI to have a chance of purchasing the Property. They
                    wanted to ultimately acquire the Property at a knock-down price: given
                    Anwar’s financial circumstances, they thought that Anwar would not be able
                    to pay the $1.68m within the 60-Day Period and, thus, ECI would be able to
                    purchase the Property in accordance with the terms of the First Option. Although
                    this appears to support the contention that the Transaction was a loan secured
                    by the Property, we see difficulties with this line of argument, as we will
                    explain at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>–<a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ pre- and post-contractual conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     We now turn to the arguments raised by the
                    respective parties in relation to their pre- and post-contractual
                    conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Pre-contractual conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    parties’ pre-contractual conduct, ECI emphasised that right from the very
                    beginning when Ivan Lim and SH Lim approached KC Tan and Poh,
                    KC Tan and Poh had already indicated that ECI was only interested in buying
                    the Property and not in lending money to Anwar. Furthermore, before they met,
                    Anwar was a complete stranger to KC Tan and Poh. The fact that ECI was only
                    interested in buying the Property, coupled with Anwar’s reluctance to sell
                    it, led to the hatching of the idea of a 60-day grace period (<em>viz</em>, the 60-Day Period) within which Ridout could cancel the
                    First Option. ECI submitted that it did not really matter <em>who</em> was the first to suggest the idea of a grace period during
                    which Ridout could cancel the First Option: in view of the diametrically opposed
                    interests of ECI and Ridout, one need not be a genius to be able to come up with
                    that idea. In this regard, ECI also highlighted the following points:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     If ECI had wanted to grant a secured
                        loan to Anwar, it could easily have structured the Transaction as a
                        straightforward loan coupled with security, given that (as found by the
                        Judge at [139] of the Judgment) this would not have been prohibited by the
                        Moneylenders Act 2008 (Act 31 of 2008) (“the Moneylenders
                        Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was significant that the first e-mail from YS Low to CS Lee
                        apropos the Property (<em>ie</em>, the e-mail of
                        2 June 2009 from YS Low to CS Lee mentioned at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) was entitled “<em>Sale and Purchase</em> of Ridout Road (Subject to
                            Contract)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added], and stated
                        explicitly that the information furnished therein was for ECI “to
                        consider whether or not to purchase the [P]roperty”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     The draft agreements and the accompanying
                        correspondence circulated between the parties prior to the 5 June 2009
                        meeting reflected precisely the intention of the parties, <em>viz</em>, that the Transaction was for the sale of the Property
                        by Ridout to ECI, with a cancellation clause inserted solely to meet
                        Ridout’s concerns.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Transaction was an arm’s length commercial
                        transaction negotiated between two independent parties, both of whom had the
                        benefit of legal advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     ECI also submitted that the Judge placed undue
                    weight on his findings of fact that at the 5 June 2009 meeting:
                    (a) ECI was only concerned with Anwar’s ability to make the requisite
                    payment needed to cancel the First Option, as opposed to the purchase price of
                    the Property (see [72] of the Judgment);
                    and (b) ECI used the litigation search done on Anwar to push the option fee
                    down from $2m to $1.5m (see [73] of the
                    Judgment). ECI said that those were wholly neutral, if not irrelevant, factors
                    as CS Lee had good reason to conduct the litigation search on Anwar since
                    Anwar was the sole shareholder and director of Ridout, and since there was a
                    trust deed in the land register indicating that the Property was held on trust
                    for him. The relevance of the litigation search was that it would ascertain
                    whether Anwar had been made a bankrupt and, as a result, lost his status as
                    Ridout’s director, and/or whether beneficial ownership of the Property had
                    vested in the Official Assignee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     ECI also argued that there was nothing
                        <em>legally improper</em> about its pressuring Anwar to
                    lower the purchase price of the Property and the option fee. This, it was
                    submitted, showed that ECI’s true intention was indeed to purchase the
                    Property. It was only natural for ECI, as a property developer, to seek for
                    itself the best possible deal. In support of this proposition, ECI cited the
                    following statement by this court in <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v
                        Deutsche Bank AG and another and another appeal</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 452 (“<em>Beckkett v Deutsche
                        Bank</em>”) at [114]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>No prospective purchaser would act or be expected to act
                            in … a commercially imprudent (or morally considerate) manner in
                            the conduct of his own commercial affairs</em>. If the mortgagee
                        wants to sell a mortgaged property cheaply or below the market price, it is
                        not up to the prospective purchaser to turn down a good offer. On the
                        contrary, commercial reality expects the latter to drive a hard bargain to
                        force the price down. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">ECI added that the agreed purchase price of $20m was neither
                    commercially absurd nor unreasonable when compared to the two forced sale
                    valuations adduced at the trial, <em>ie</em>, $23.2m
                    according to the Colliers Report dated 15 April 2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and $21.6m as at 5 June
                    2009 according to a report by Savills (Singapore) Pte Ltd, the valuer engaged by
                    ECI (“the Savills Report”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In contrast, the three respondents
                    (individually and collectively) referred to the following aspects of the
                    parties’ pre-contractual conduct to support the Judge’s finding that
                    the true nature of the Transaction was that of a secured loan:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     At the 5 June 2009 meeting,
                        there was no real negotiation on the purchase price for the Property.
                        Instead, the focus of the meeting was on Anwar’s ability to pay the
                        $1.68m if Ridout were to cancel the First Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     At the separate breakout meeting
                        between Anwar, KC Tan and Poh held in the course of the 5 June
                        2009 meeting, KC Tan and Poh made it clear to Anwar that they were only
                        prepared to pay $1.5m as the option fee, and not $2m as stated in the Draft
                        Option. This reduction of the option fee from $2m to $1.5m was presumably to
                        lower ECI’s financial risk as a result of the litigation search done
                        on Anwar, and was wholly consistent with Anwar’s evidence that
                        everyone present at the 5 June 2009 meeting understood that the option
                        fee was, in reality, meant to be a loan to help him with short-term
                        financing. The three respondents submitted that this reduction in the option
                        fee would only make sense if the option fee was in truth a loan because if
                        the sale of the Property envisaged in the First Option was genuine, the
                        option fee paid would have been part payment of the purchase price and there
                        would not have been any real need for ECI to press down the option fee. If
                        Ridout could not repay the option fee plus the specified amount of
                        compensation needed in order to cancel the First Option, it would have been
                        a welcome opportunity for ECI to purchase the Property at the attractive
                        price of only $20m.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     During cross-examination, KC Tan and Poh confirmed that they
                        knew Ridout could give good title of the Property to ECI despite
                        Anwar’s personal financial difficulties and the various legal
                        proceedings against him. Poh’s evidence on this point was as
                            follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>

                        and the law suits against Anwar.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     CS Lee said that he “had [the Moneylenders
                        Act] in mind when [he was] drafting [the] documents”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> but concluded
                        that it had no application to the Transaction. The three respondents
                        submitted that it was precisely because the Transaction was a loan or
                        contained features that came close to offending the prohibitions under the
                        Moneylenders Act that CS Lee considered the implications thereof, and
                        sought to disguise the true nature of the Transaction by splitting up the
                        instruments documenting it into two separate instruments (<em>viz</em>, the First Option and the Deed of Settlement) as well as
                        by inserting misleading wording into and post-dating the Deed of
                        Settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_e"></a>(e)     ECI’s attempt to explain away the significance of the litigation
                        search done on Anwar –
                        <em>viz</em>, that it was necessary to ascertain
                        whether Anwar (the beneficiary under the trust held by Ridout on the
                        Property) had been made a bankrupt, thereby vesting beneficial ownership of
                        the Property in the Official Assignee – was an afterthought as this
                        was not brought out in evidence. In fact, the litigation search reflected
                        ECI’s concern about the risk of lending money to
                Anwar.</p>

                    that Ridout had regarded the Transaction as a sale of the Property to ECI,
                    subject only to the right of cancellation within the 60-Day Period:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_e"></a>(e)     Even after raising the allegation that
                        the Transaction was an illegal moneylending transaction, Anwar himself wrote
                        a letter dated 16 September 2009 using Ridout’s letterhead
                            (<em>ie</em>, the letter mentioned at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above), wherein he stated that there was

                        Anwar’s statement of liability when he filed an affidavit on
                        23 December 2009 pursuant to his application under s 45 of the
                        Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed).</p>

                        letters was merely that it was taking instructions from
                    Ridout.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     ECI submitted that none of the above
                    circumstances were considered by the Judge. Instead, the Judged inferred that
                    ECI did not genuinely intend to purchase the Property based on what were really
                    insignificant events, such as ECI’s failure to obtain financing for the
                    purchase of the Property, its late payment of the stamp fee on the First Option
                    and its late making of legal requisitions, when there were clearly plausible and
                    credible explanations for those events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     With regard to its delay in paying the stamp
                    fee on the First Option and making legal requisitions, ECI explained that the
                    delay was the result of Anwar’s persistent attempts to persuade it to
                    forego its rights under the First Option in consideration of the payment of a
                    settlement sum, which was initially agreed at $3.5m (under the September 2009
                    Settlement) and later increased to $5m (under the November 2009 Settlement). It
                    was submitted that it made sense for ECI to refrain from incurring further
                    expenses towards the completion of the purchase of the Property while there
                    appeared to be prospects of being able to reach an amicable settlement with
                    Ridout <em>vis-à-vis</em> the latter’s purported
                    cancellation of the First Option. After Ridout failed to pay the settlement sum
                    of $5m due under the November 2009 Settlement by the stipulated deadline of noon
                    on 16 November 2009, ECI decided to cease all further discussions with
                    Ridout/Anwar and proceeded to seek the completion of the purchase of the
                    Property. To that end, legal requisitions were sent on 16, 17 and
                    20 November 2009<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> and the stamp fee on
                    the First Option was paid on 24 November 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Ridout, on the other hand, countered
                    ECI’s explanation for the late payment of the stamp fee on the First
                    Option and the late making of legal requisitions by highlighting the various
                    inconsistencies in ECI’s ever-shifting (so Ridout submitted) position on
                    these matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     The evidence of KC Tan and Poh
                        in their joint affidavit filed on 15 January 2010 was that ECI had
                        always intended to complete the purchase of the Property despite
                        Anwar’s various attempts to reach a settlement by which ECI’s
                        intended purchase of the Property would be cancelled. Notably, at
                        para 32 of their joint affidavit, they stated that in early September
                        2009, Anwar contacted them again to try to convince ECI to enter into such a
                        settlement, but “[they] were adamant about the purchase as by [that]
                        time, the property prices for [Good Class Bungalows] had risen
                            significantly”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     However, Poh eventually conceded under
                        cross-examination that on 3 September 2009, “there was an
                        agreement to settle at [$]3.5 million in principle”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Poh made this
                        concession only when he was confronted with evidence produced by Anwar (in
                        the form of SMS messages) that there was such a
                    settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     In
                        short, it was only at the trial that KC Tan and Poh admitted to the
                        existence of the September 2009 Settlement, and endeavoured to explain away
                        their inaction in making legal requisitions on the ground that the parties
                        were then still attempting to reach an amicable
                settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     With regard to its delay in obtaining
                    financing to effect the purchase of the Property, ECI clarified that its ability
                    to finance the Transaction was never an issue as that was not disputed by any
                    party in any of the pleadings or affidavits filed in OS 1357, nor in the
                    list of issues presented to the Judge for adjudication. In this regard, we note
                    that there was a letter of offer dated 9 September 2009 from HLF offering
                    ECI a loan of $18m for the purchase of the Property. Ultimately, ECI did not
                    accept the offer. It was confirmed by HLF’s counsel that HLF’s offer
                    lapsed as ECI did not take steps to fulfil the condition precedent of the
                    proposed loan, <em>ie</em>, to increase the paid-up capital
                    of ECI, which then stood at only $2,000, to $100,000. ECI pointed out that both
                    KC Tan and Poh had given evidence that ECI had sufficient funds from other
                    sources to complete the purchase (<em>eg</em>, by drawing
                    down on other lines of credit or utilising cash reserves from a related
                        company).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> ECI therefore submitted
                    that the Judge erred (at [81] of the
                    Judgment) in finding that it ought to have adduced more proof of its ability to
                    finance the Transaction and that the time to produce such evidence had long
                    passed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On its part, Ridout, with regard to
                    ECI’s submissions on Anwar’s police report dated 29 August 2009
                    (see sub-para (d) of <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above),
                    pointed out that although Anwar had not referred to the Transaction as a loan
                        <em>per se</em> in the police report, he had stated
                    that he had been loaned money at “an interest fee of 6% [per
                        month]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Further, two days before
                    lodging the police report, he had sent a SMS message to Poh stating:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I will have to file a report of money lending. The [T]ransaction
                        was based on borrowing SIN $1.5mil for two months yielding
                        SIN $1.68mil. Thank you. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In any event, Anwar had complained in his police report that ECI was
                    “trying to make more money out of the deal”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> This, Ridout submitted, was
                    consistent with its case that all that ECI was entitled to under the Two
                    Instruments was a high interest rate for lending Anwar the option fee of
                    $1.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inconsistencies in the evidence of Ridout’s witnesses </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     We now turn to the respective parties’
                    submissions on the evidence of Ridout’s witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     ECI submitted that the evidence proffered by
                    Ridout’s witnesses as to the true nature of the Transaction, both on
                    affidavit and at the trial, was confusing. Where Anwar’s evidence was
                    concerned, ECI highlighted the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     At the trial, Anwar’s position
                        was that throughout the course of the negotiations between the parties, all
                        that he had in mind was that the Transaction was an <em>unsecured loan</em>, with the Property playing no role
                            whatsoever.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     However, in Ridout’s pleaded
                        case for OS 1357, it was stated that “the true intent of the
                        parties was to provide <em>security</em> to [ECI] for
                        the loan of $1.5 million from [ECI] to [Ridout]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> [emphasis

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     In his
                        affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) filed on 25 June
                        2010, Anwar deposed that he was surprised when YS Low informed him on
                        or about 2 June 2009 that the documentation for the Transaction
                        consisted of “an option to purchase the [P]roperty followed by a
                        so[-]called Deed of Settlement”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> As he was “extremely
                        uncomfortable to give an option for a loan”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> he “requested a
                        meeting so that [he] could satisfy [himself] that the [T]ransaction was a

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_d"></a>(d)     Under cross-examination, Anwar sought
                        to retract the version of events set out in his AEIC as inaccurate. On the
                        stand, he said that he first learnt about the structure of the Transaction
                        in a conversation with Panthradil during the car journey on the way to the
                        5 June 2009 meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_e"></a>(e)     Anwar sought to shift the
                        responsibility for all communications with YS Low apropos the
                        Transaction to Panthradil.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> This, however, was
                        contradicted by Panthradil’s evidence on the stand. Panthradil
                        testified that he had no substantive discussions with YS Low about the
                        Transaction, apart from the mechanics for paying the option fee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     ECI submitted that the aforesaid
                    inconsistencies in Anwar’s case were fabricated to mask the fact that
                    Anwar knew that the Transaction involved the sale of the Property by Ridout to
                    ECI. ECI pointed out that the Judge had found Anwar to be an experienced
                    business entrepreneur who had had the benefit of advice from both his lawyer and
                    Panthradil (the chief financial officer of another company owned by Anwar)
                    before he signed the Two Instruments (see [56] and [58] of the
                    Judgment). Yet, inexplicably (in ECI’s submission), the Judge, at
                        [56] of the Judgment, found that the
                    Transaction was in fact a disguised loan coupled with security:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under cross examination Panthradil said that he received the [D]raft
                        [O]ption and [the] [D]raft [D]eed … on or after 3 June 2009 and
                        upon reading them, said to [Anwar]: “Hey, Pak, this looks like
                        you’re selling the [P]roperty”. Panthradil said [Anwar]’s
                        response was: “No, I will clear it before that. Its [<em>sic</em>] just the structure to enable the
                        borrowing” … I accept Panthradil’s evidence over
                        [Anwar]’s version. Panthradil said when he saw the cancellation and
                        the factoring in of the interest[,] he saw the documents as a secured loan
                        structure. Panthradil said they were desperate for funds because no one was
                        going to lend [Anwar] $2m “clean”. I therefore find that
                        [Anwar] intended to use the Property as security for the loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     ECI argued that a careful examination of
                    Panthradil’s evidence showed that his evidence was in fact consistent with
                    and supported its case, <em>viz</em>, that Anwar was well
                    aware that Ridout had to sell the Property to ECI if Ridout did not cancel the
                    First Option within the 60-Day Period. Further, Anwar’s reference to the
                    structure of the Transaction demonstrated that he knew that the Two Instruments
                    did not simply provide for the grant of a loan to him, but also something
                    more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In countering ECI’s argument on the
                    alleged inconsistencies in Anwar’s evidence, Ridout submitted that the
                    court was entitled to accept Panthradil’s evidence that the 5 June
                    2009 meeting was “more to lend … money and [KC Tan and Poh]
                    were more concerned of … Anwar’s ability to repay the
                        money”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Although Panthradil
                    was only an employee of Anwar, there was, Ridout submitted, no suggestion that
                    he was not truthful in his testimony. In respect of ECI’s criticism that
                    the Judge erred in treating Panthradil’s evidence as indicative of
                    Anwar’s intention, Ridout submitted that ECI had mischaracterised the
                    Judge’s finding, which, simply put, was that Panthradil’s evidence
                    was corroborative of Anwar’s evidence that he did not want to sell the
                    Property all along and had made this known to his employee (<em>viz</em>, Panthradil).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Transaction lacked the key features of a loan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We move now to the parties’ submissions
                    on whether the Transaction lacked the key features of a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     ECI submitted that the Transaction lacked many
                    of the key indicia and features of a loan. It cited the case of <em>City Hardware</em>, where the High Court accepted (at
                        [23]) the following definition of
                    “loan” set out in Clifford L Pannam, <em>The
                        Law of Money Lenders in Australia and New Zealand</em> (The Law Book
                    Company Limited, 1965) at p 6:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A loan of money may be defined, in general terms, as a simple contract
                        whereby one person (“the lender”) pays or agrees to pay a sum
                        of money in consideration of a promise by another person (“the
                        borrower”) to repay the money upon demand or at a fixed date. The
                        promise of repayment may or may not be coupled with a promise to pay
                        interest on the money so paid. <em>The essence of the
                            transaction is the promise of repayment</em>. … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     ECI submitted that the case of <em>In re George Inglefield, Limited</em> [1933] Ch 1, which
                    discussed (at 27–28) the difference between a sale and a mortgage or
                    charge as follows, was also instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In a transaction of sale the vendor is not entitled to
                            get back the subject-matter of the sale by returning to the purchaser
                            the money that has passed between them</em>. In the case of a
                        mortgage or charge, the mortgagor is entitled, until he has been foreclosed,
                        to get back the subject-matter of the mortgage or charge by returning to the
                        mortgagee the money that has passed between them. The second essential
                        difference is that if the mortgagee realizes the subject-matter of the
                        mortgage for a sum more than sufficient to repay him, with interest and the
                        costs, the money that has passed between him and the mortgagor[,] he has to
                        account to the mortgagor for the surplus. <em>If the
                            purchaser sells the subject-matter of the purchase, and realizes a
                            profit, of course he has not got to account to the vendor for the
                            profit</em>. Thirdly, if the mortgagee realizes the mortgage
                        property for a sum that is insufficient to repay him the money that he has
                        paid to the mortgagor, together with interest and costs, then the mortgagee
                        is entitled to recover from the mortgagor the balance of the money, either
                        because there is a covenant by the mortgagor to repay the money advanced by
                        the mortgagee, or because of the existence of the simple contract debt which
                        is created by the mere fact of the advance having been made. <em>If the purchaser were to resell the purchased property at a
                            price which was insufficient to recoup him the money that he paid to the
                            vendor, of course he would not be entitled to recover the balance from
                            the vendor</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In this regard, ECI highlighted that the
                    following key features of a loan were missing from the Transaction:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     There was no provision for the
                        payment of interest after the 60-Day Period if Ridout failed to cancel the
                        First Option within that period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     Likewise, there was no provision for the enforcement of
                        payment of the “outstanding sum” (<em>ie</em>, the $1.68m) should Ridout fail to cancel the First
                        Option within the 60-Day Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     The amount of compensation which Ridout had to pay for
                        cancelling the First Option was $180,000 in respect of an option fee of
                        $1.5m. This worked out to an “interest rate” of 12% per annum
                        (or 6% per month). This figure should be contrasted with the original
                        provisions set out in the Draft Option and the Draft Deed, which stipulated
                        a cancellation fee of $250,000 in respect of an option fee of $2m (see
                            <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). That arrangement would
                        have yielded a higher “interest rate” of 12.5% per annum (or
                        6.25% per month). If ECI had intended the Transaction to be a loan, it would
                        not have sought to reduce the option fee to $1.5m and thereby earn a lower
                        “interest rate” as that would not make commercial
                        sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">ECI submitted that had it truly intended to grant
                    a loan to Anwar, it would have taken a valid security over the Property and
                    would have made appropriate provisions in the contractual documents to address
                    the matters mentioned at sub-paras (a)–(c) above, instead of doing
                    what it did, <em>ie</em>, structuring the Transaction in
                    the form of the Two Instruments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In rebuttal to ECI’s point about the
                    lack of provision for interest to be paid after the 60-Day Period if Ridout did
                    not cancel the First Option, Ridout stated that the Transaction was meant to be
                    a short-term loan to Anwar and, therefore, there was no provision for interest
                    accruing after the 60-Day Period. In the event of default (<em>ie</em>, in the event that Ridout did not cancel the First Option and
                    therefore did not pay ECI the $1.68m), there could be an implied term that ECI
                    could sell the Property at its market price and recoup the amount lent to Anwar.
                    Ridout further submitted that the lack of provision for interest after the
                    60-Day Period was, in any event, irrelevant, given KC Tan and Poh’s
                    motive for structuring the Transaction as a sale of the Property with a view to
                    taking unfair advantage of the situation if Anwar was unable to pay the $1.68m
                    within the 60-Day Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As for the reduction of the “interest
                    rate” for the “loan” of the option fee from 6.25% to 6% per
                    month, Ridout argued that this followed from the lower sum of $1.5m (as opposed
                    to the sum of $2m stated in the Draft Option) which ECI was comfortable to lend
                    to Anwar. In any event, Ridout submitted, the difference was <em>de minimis</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Similarly, counsel for Thomas Chan contended
                    that all the hallmarks of a loan were present in the Transaction (as the Judge
                    found at [30], [31] and [71] of the Judgment). It was submitted that the absence of a
                    term providing for continued interest after the 60-Day Period was not fatal to
                    Thomas Chan’s case as a “windfall” to ECI was still provided
                    for in the form of ECI being able to purchase the Property at the knock-down
                    price of $20m, which would easily exceed the interest accruing after the 60-Day
                    Period (had there been provision for such interest to be paid) and which bore no
                    relation to the loss that ECI would suffer if Anwar failed to pay the $1.68m
                    within the 60-Day Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Counsel for Thomas Chan also highlighted that
                    there was no evidence of any real negotiation or agreement on the purchase price
                    of the Property either before or at the 5 June 2009 meeting. The purchase
                    price of $20m was really the outstanding mortgage amount due from Anwar to HLF.
                    This emerged from KC Tan’s evidence during cross-examination, as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I would also like for you to confirm that in fact
                            the sum of 20 million was arrived at by you, or proposed by you and
                            … Poh after you had seen how much was owed to [HLF] under the
                            mortgage that [HLF] had on the [P]roperty.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, I suppose that was the case,
                        yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, even at the 5 June 2009 meeting itself, there was no
                    evidence of any negotiation on the purchase price of the Property. It would
                    appear, Thomas Chan’s counsel submitted, that Anwar did not resist
                    ECI’s efforts to set the purchase price at $20m in the First Option
                    because he did not contemplate a sale of the Property and felt sure that he
                    could repay the loan amount (<em>viz</em>, the $1.5m option
                    fee) plus interest (<em>viz</em>, the $180,000 compensation
                    fee) within the 60-Day Period. Notably, ECI’s evidence confirmed its
                    knowledge of Anwar’s nonchalant attitude towards the purchase price of the
                    Property stated in the First Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on the true nature of the Transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is not in dispute that the proper approach
                    in determining the true nature of a transaction is to look at the substance, as
                    opposed to the form, thereof (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>–<a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above). In
                    so far as the documentation for the Transaction is concerned, it is clear that
                    the First Option contained a “normal” option in favour of ECI,
                    albeit with some unusual features, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> and <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above
                        (<em>eg</em>, the quantum of the option fee (<em>ie</em>, $1.5m), which was much higher than the market norm
                    of 1% of the purchase price, and the validity period of the First Option
                        (<em>ie</em>, 90 days)). The Deed of Settlement
                    accorded to Ridout the right, within the 60-Day Period, to cancel the First
                    Option by paying ECI the $1.68m. There can be no doubt as to what the Two
                    Instruments mean on their face.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Like the Judge, we also accept that Anwar, the
                    sole shareholder and director of Ridout, who is also its directing mind, did not
                    want to sell the Property. All he wanted was to get a temporary loan to tide him
                    over so that HLF would not exercise its right of sale as the mortgagee of the
                    Property. Despite soundings made on his behalf, no one was interested in lending
                    him money, bearing in mind that there was then a mortgage over the Property in
                    favour of HLF and a charge for $10m in favour of Orion over the remaining
                    proceeds of sale of the Property. In view of those prior encumbrances, and
                    bearing in mind what was believed to be the market value of the Property, there
                    was really no value left in the Property which Anwar could use to obtain a loan.
                    It was against that backdrop that ECI came into the picture. As mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> and <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above, ECI, being a property developer, was likewise not
                    interested in extending any loan to Anwar, but it was willing to consider buying
                    the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     At this point, we would observe, as did the
                    Judge, that Anwar is unquestionably a seasoned businessman and entrepreneur. He
                    cannot claim to be a novice in business, although he was financially very
                    stretched at the material time due to the effects of the global financial
                    meltdown of 2008. Similarly, ECI’s directors, KC Tan and Poh, are
                    also men of business. Thus, neither Anwar (and in turn, Ridout) nor KC Tan
                    and Poh (and in turn, ECI) can claim to be at a disadvantage in the business
                    sense, although, as just mentioned, Anwar (and in turn, Ridout) was financially
                    very stretched at the material time. As observed by this court in <em>Beckkett v Deutsche Bank</em> at <a href="#p1_114">[114]</a> (reproduced at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>
                    above), it is legally permissible for a man of business to squeeze the best deal
                    for himself, taking advantage of the economic weaknesses of the other
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It seems to us that having regard to what were
                    clearly different objectives on the part of the parties concerned (<em>viz</em>, Anwar wanting to borrow money and ECI wanting to
                    buy the Property at the best possible price), the arrangement that was
                    eventually worked out by the parties’ solicitors, as reflected in the Two
                    Instruments, satisfied, to an extent and certainly not completely, the needs of
                    both parties. As the Judge noted at [58]
                    of the Judgment, Anwar was confident that he would be able to raise, within the
                    60-Day Period, the $1.68m which Ridout had to pay to have the First Option
                    cancelled. As for ECI, it clearly wanted to buy the Property at the best
                    possible price. It obviously recognised that the Transaction (as set out in the
                    Two Instruments), although not its preferred choice, was, in the circumstances,
                    the next best thing, in the sense that should Anwar be unable to raise the
                    $1.68m which Ridout needed to pay to have the First Option cancelled, ECI would
                    have the chance to purchase the Property at the extremely attractive price of
                    $20m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In a case of this nature, as between the oral
                    evidence of the parties and the objective contemporaneous documentary evidence,
                    greater emphasis should be placed on the latter (see <em>Ng Chee
                        Chuan v Ng Ai Tee (administratrix of the estate of Yap Yoon Moi,
                        deceased)</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 918 at [17]). At the material time, both parties were
                    legally represented, and the Two Instruments were considered and approved by the
                    respective solicitors as representing what their clients were prepared to
                    accept, in contrast to what they would have preferred. It would be fair to
                    assume that the legal effect of the Two Instruments would have been explained to
                    the parties by their respective solicitors. It might well be true that Anwar
                    never intended to sell the Property, and certainly not at the price of $20m,
                    which was lower than even the forced sale value of $23.2m indicated in the
                    Colliers Report (although that was dated 15 April 2009, some seven weeks
                    before the First Option was granted to ECI). Be that as it may, Anwar cannot
                    deny that while he might not have wanted to sell the Property (which, as
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a> above, we accept) –
                    and he was even confident (as the Judge noted at [58] of the Judgment) that he would not have to sell the
                    Property as he felt sure he could raise, within the 60-Day Period, the $1.68m
                    needed for Ridout to cancel the First Option – if he should fail to raise
                    the $1.68m, ECI would be able to exercise the First Option and buy over the
                    Property. This, we find, was precisely what happened. It should be highlighted
                    that the conversation which transpired between Panthradil and Anwar (reproduced
                    in the quotation at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above) and
                    Anwar’s (misplaced) confidence in being able to “clear
                        it”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> (<em>ie</em>, raise the $1.68m which Ridout had to pay to cancel the First
                    Option) clearly show that Anwar was <em>fully aware</em> of
                    the fact that the Transaction was, in fact, an agreement for the sale of the
                    Property by Ridout to ECI. The arrangement set out in the Two Instruments gave
                    Anwar some hope of keeping the Property, but it does not lie in his mouth to now
                    claim that he did not fully appreciate the consequential effects of his failure
                    to raise the $1.68m which Ridout had to pay to have the First Option cancelled.
                    As it turned out, Anwar’s confidence was ill-founded. However, that is
                    hardly a proper basis or ground to hold that the Two Instruments do not mean
                    what they say. There is nothing in the Two Instruments which is unclear or
                    ambiguous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We turn next to the three respondents’
                    argument that at the 5 June 2009 meeting, there was no real negotiation on
                    the purchase price stated in the First Option. To say the least, the state of
                    the property market at that point in time was uncertain. The Colliers Report,
                    which was dated 15 April 2009, placed a forced value of $23.2m on the
                    Property, while the Savills Report placed a forced sale value of $21.6m on it
                    (as at 5 June 2009). To put the matter most favourably to Anwar, the only
                    reason we could think of as to why he agreed to state the purchase price as $20m
                    in the First Option was because he was confident – extremely confident
                    – that he would not have to sell the Property and, thus, the purchase
                    price stated in the First Option was, in his view at that time, no more than an
                    academic figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     We would highlight that there is another
                    implication which arises from the three respondents’ assertion that the
                    Two Instruments were a disguise for what was in truth a secured loan with a high
                    interest rate. As mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    and <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> above), the Two Instruments were
                    drawn up and considered by solicitors. If the three respondents’ claim
                    were true, it would mean that both ECI’s solicitors and Ridout’s
                    solicitors were involved in creating the disguised loan. It is not necessary for
                    us, at this point, to offer any views on the impropriety or want of probity of
                    such conduct on the part of the solicitors concerned if the claim is indeed
                    true. More significantly, we note that at the trial, Ridout’s counsel did
                    not put it to either YS Low or CS Lee that they were instructed to
                    draw up the Two Instruments to disguise what was really a secured loan with a
                    high interest rate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     This brings us to a related issue raised by
                    the three respondents, <em>viz</em>, the fact that
                    CS Lee had considered the applicability and/or the implications of the
                    Moneylenders Act <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Transaction. This
                    was harped on by the three respondents to reinforce their claim that the
                    Transaction was a moneylending transaction <em>simpliciter</em>. In our opinion, there is a leap in logic in this
                    argument. It is hard for us to see how the mere fact that CS Lee was
                    thorough in his consideration of all the <em>potential</em>
                    implications of the Transaction supports the view that the Transaction was a
                    disguised moneylending transaction (or, for that matter, the converse view that
                    the Transaction was what it purported to be, <em>viz</em>,
                    an agreement for the sale of the Property by Ridout to ECI). The three
                    respondents’ argument on this point is a <em>non
                        sequitur</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     We now turn to the three respondents’
                    arguments on ECI’s tardiness in taking steps to complete the purchase of
                    the Property after exercising the First Option on 27 August 2009. It was
                    emphasised that ECI did nothing on the conveyancing front for a long period
                    after it exercised the First Option. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that the
                    purported date for the completion of the purchase of the Property was
                    19 November 2009, ECI only made the necessary legal requisitions on 16, 17
                    and <em>even</em> 20 November 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The First Option was
                    only stamped on 24 November 2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> five
                    days after the purported completion date. No financing arrangement was made to
                    enable ECI to complete the purchase (in this regard, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above, although HLF offered ECI a loan of
                    $18m on 9 September 2009 to complete the purchase, that offer was allowed
                    to lapse). At <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> and <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above, we have already set out the
                    explanations of ECI on these matters. In our view, these matters are more
                    germane to the Second Main Issue (which we will consider at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> <em>et seq</em> below), <em>viz</em>,
                    the issue of whether, if the Transaction was indeed for the sale of the Property
                    by Ridout to ECI, the latter should be granted specific performance of the Sale
                    Agreement (as defined at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We also note Ridout’s contention that
                    ECI’s delay in taking steps to complete the purchase of the Property was
                    due to the desire of KC Tan and Poh to extract the maximum monetary
                    compensation from Ridout in return for withdrawing the two caveats lodged by ECI
                    against the Property. Put in another way, Ridout’s contention, in essence,
                    was that completing the purchase of the Property was, by the time of the
                    September 2009 Settlement, clearly no longer in the minds of KC Tan and
                    Poh. According to Ridout, the exchanges between it and ECI showed that ECI
                    exercised the First Option on 27 August 2009 merely for the purpose of
                    preserving its bargaining portion, as opposed to for the purpose of completing
                    its purchase of the Property. In support of this argument, Ridout pointed to
                    Poh’s evidence that even though ECI exercised the First Option on
                    27 August 2009, it was still prepared to forego completion of the purchase
                    if it received more compensation from Ridout:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So, although in your minds, on 27 August

                            the [P]roperty, <em>you were still prepared to give it
                                back if you got an extra $2 million;

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We also note that the Judge, at [30] of the Judgment, said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On [ECI]’s side, I find that [it] sensed an opportunity to make
                        money. If [it] could drive a hard bargain, [it] had nothing to lose. If
                        [Anwar] managed to pay off the $1.5m, [ECI] would reap a profit of $180,000
                        for [its] 60-day loan. If [Anwar] did not manage to pay off the $1.5m, [it]
                        had the option to purchase the Property at $3.2m below the forced sale
                        valuation of $23.2m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     We do not see how the circumstances enumerated
                    above entail that the Transaction should be regarded as a loan <em>simpliciter</em> and nothing else. While ECI <em>did</em> drive a hard bargain in the hope (as so aptly put by
                    the Judge at [30] of the Judgment) of
                    achieving a gain regardless of whether or not Ridout cancelled the First Option,
                    the Transaction was nevertheless an arrangement entered into freely by Anwar on
                    behalf of Ridout. No one and nothing compelled Anwar to enter into it, except
                    for his own financial predicament at the material time. It cannot be
                    sufficiently emphasised that Anwar had the benefit of legal advice before he
                    entered into the Transaction. The fact that he miscalculated his own capacity
                    –
                    <em>viz</em>, he believed (mistakenly, as it turned out)
                    that he could raise, within the 60-Day Period, the $1.68m needed to have the
                    First Option cancelled – cannot alter what the parties had agreed on.
                    Moreover, the fact that ECI, after exercising the First Option on 27 August
                    2009, was dilatory in taking steps to complete the purchase of the Property
                    cannot alter the fact that ECI was contractually entitled to have the Property
                    conveyed to it at the price of $20m. ECI’s tardiness in this regard is
                    relevant only to the Second Main Issue (see <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> <em>et seq</em> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Before we leave the First Main Issue, we wish
                    to address an argument raised by counsel for Thomas Chan. His contention was
                    that the First Option, read with the Deed of Settlement, meant that ECI did not
                    have a “true” option in the sense that ECI could not, within the
                    60-Day Period, choose to buy the Property by exercising the First Option.
                    ECI’s right to choose to buy the Property was deferred for 60 days; in
                    other words, there was no option at the outset of the Transaction. It was
                    submitted that had Ridout managed to pay ECI the $1.68m within the 60-Day Period
                    (which ended on 6 August 2009 as agreed by the parties (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above)), the obvious and only treatment of the
                    Transaction would be as a secured loan which had been repaid with (an
                    exorbitant) interest. Technically, no option to purchase the Property would ever
                    have existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In our opinion, this argument disregards the
                    essential features of the Transaction. The Two Instruments clearly provide that
                    the First Option could be exercised by ECI after the expiry of the 60-Day Period
                    unless Ridout fulfilled the condition to have the option cancelled. As things
                    turned out, Ridout did not fulfil that condition. The First Option <em>did</em> become exercisable by ECI, and the latter did
                    exercise it on 27 August 2009. The argument mounted by Thomas Chan’s
                    counsel is flawed as the 60-Day Period and the cancellation feature in the Deed
                    of Settlement do not negate the <em>existence</em> of the
                    First Option. In fact, much to the contrary, these aspects of the Transaction
                    are <em>evidence</em> of the existence of the First Option:
                    the 60-Day Period essentially created a period of deferment of ECI’s right
                    to exercise the First Option, which deferment in and of itself <em>presumes</em> the existence of the First Option. While it is
                    true that had Ridout managed to raise the $1.68m within the 60-Day Period, it
                    would have cancelled the First Option, the very idea that Ridout had a right to
                    cancel the First Option similarly acknowledges the existence of this
                    option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In the light of the foregoing, we are, with
                    respect, unable to agree with the Judge’s holding that the Transaction was
                    in truth a secured loan. We find that the weight of the evidence inextricably
                    points towards the converse finding that the true nature of the Transaction (as
                    embodied in the Two Instruments) is that of a genuine agreement for the sale of
                    the Property by Ridout to ECI. As Ridout did not fulfil the condition to have
                    the First Option cancelled within the 60-Day Period, we hold that ECI validly
                    exercised that option on 27 August 2009, and there came into being a valid
                    contract (<em>ie</em>, the Sale Agreement as defined at
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above) under which Ridout was
                    required to sell the Property to ECI at the price of $20m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Second Main Issue: Whether specific performance of the Sale
                Agreement should be granted to ECI</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     We turn now to the Second Main Issue. Given
                    our ruling on the First Main Issue, the Second Main Issue would now be more
                    appropriately framed as, simply, whether ECI should be granted specific
                    performance of the Sale Agreement (<em>cf</em> the way in
                    which we set out the Second Main Issue earlier at sub-para (b) of <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). In the court below, the Judge held
                    that even if a valid agreement for the sale of the Property to ECI had come into
                    being between Ridout and ECI pursuant to the latter’s exercise of the
                    First Option on 27 August 2009, he would, in all the circumstances of the
                    case and in exercise of his discretion, have refused to grant ECI the equitable
                    remedy of specific performance. The crux of ECI’s challenge to this ruling
                    by the Judge is that as the Sale Agreement relates to immovable property, it is
                        <em>prima facie</em> entitled to specific performance
                    of that agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The remedy of specific performance is founded
                    in equity and is discretionary in nature. It is settled principle that an
                    appellate court will only interfere with a first instance judge’s exercise
                    of discretion on limited grounds. As noted in <em>Guan Chong
                        Cocoa Manufacturer Sdn Bhd v Pratiwi Shipping SA</em> [2003]
                    1 SLR(R) 157, an appellate court will only interfere if it is shown that
                    either: (a) the judge’s exercise of discretion was based on a
                    misunderstanding of the law and/or the evidence before him; or (b) the
                    judge’s decision was so aberrant that it must be set aside on the ground
                    that no reasonable judge mindful of his duty to act judicially could have
                    reached it. Enunciating the same principle are the cases of <em>The Vishva Apurva</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 912 and <em>Federal Computer Services Sdn Bhd v Ang Jee Hai Eric</em>
                    [1991] 2 SLR(R) 427.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In the Judgment, the Judge gave five broad
                    grounds for refusing to grant ECI specific performance of the Sale Agreement,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     ECI had sought to purchase the
                        Property for investment/financial gain, for which purpose the equitable
                        remedy of specific performance was not granted as a matter of
                    course;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     damages
                        would be an adequate remedy for ECI;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_c"></a>(c)     ECI had come to equity with “unclean
                        hands”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_d"></a>(d)     ECI had agreed to accept an enhanced compensation of $5m pursuant to the
                        November 2009 Settlement (<em>cf</em> the compensation
                        of $3.5m under the September 2009 Settlement) in exchange for not completing
                        the purchase of the Property; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_e"></a>(e)     ECI had acquiesced to Ridout’s sale of the Property
                        to another party and was therefore estopped from insisting on completing its
                        purchase of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In declining to grant ECI specific performance
                    of the Sale Agreement, the Judge departed from the orthodox position that
                    specific performance will always be decreed for what we will hereafter term
                    “land contracts”, <em>ie</em>, contracts
                    relating to immovable property (see Gareth Jones &amp; William Goodhart,
                        <em>Specific Performance</em> (Butterworths,
                    2nd Ed, 1996) (“<em>Jones &amp;
                    Goodhart</em>”) at pp 128–132). The orthodox position is
                    rooted in the premise that land is deemed to be unique and no substitute is
                    adequate (see <em>Wong Chee Siong and another v Tan Boon Hwa and
                        another</em> [2010] SGHC 222 at [20]). Damages are considered inadequate even when the interest
                    in question is a mere commercial lease for a short term (see <em>Excelsior Hotel Pte Ltd v Hiap Bee (Singapore) Pte Ltd (OCBC Finance
                        (Singapore) Ltd, intervener)</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 322 at
                        [10]). The Judge departed from this
                    orthodox position and relied on the Canadian Supreme Court’s decision in
                        <em>Sinnadurai Paramadevan and Blossom Paramadevan v Bernard
                        Semelhago</em> [1996] 2 SCR 415 (“<em>Semelhago</em>”) for the proposition that specific performance
                    should not be granted as a matter of course for land contracts, absent evidence
                    that the property concerned is unique. He opined (at [106] of the Judgment) that as “the
                    equitable origin of specific performance … meant that discretion [was]
                    its hallmark” (see Robert J Sharpe, <em>Injunctions
                        and Specific Performance</em> (Canada Law Book, Looseleaf Ed, 2010
                    release) (“<em>Sharpe</em>”) at
                    para 8.90, which was cited at [103] of the Judgment), he preferred the approach taken by the
                    courts in Canada and also in New Zealand. Reference was also made to the earlier
                    local case of <em>Good Property Land Development Pte Ltd v
                        Société Générale</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 97, where our High Court
                    observed at [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]here the main object of owning land is not the personal
                        enjoyment thereof but the profit derivable therefrom, it would be
                        unrealistic to believe that damages would not be an adequate remedy to the
                        owner for the loss of the mortgaged property. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In such a situation, damages may still be considered adequate
                    notwithstanding that land is generally deemed to be unique (see <em>Coastland Properties Pte Ltd v Lin Geok Choo</em> [1993]
                    3 SLR(R) 890 at [2]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In the discussion which follows, we will first
                    set out the respective parties’ submissions on the Judge’s view that
                    specific performance should not be granted as a matter of course for land
                    contracts and the Judge’s reasons for declining to grant ECI specific
                    performance of the Sale Agreement in the present case. We will then set out our
                    decision on the Second Main Issue proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ submissions on the Judge’s view that
                specific performance should not be granted as a matter of course for land
                contracts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     ECI submitted that <em>Semelhago</em> should not be followed by the Singapore courts because
                    it has been the subject of much criticism, and applying the principle therein
                    would only lead to unwarranted uncertainty. ECI pointed to the fact that the
                    Alberta Law Reform Institute had appointed a board (“the Alberta
                    Board”) to consider whether the decision in <em>Semelhago</em> ought to be overturned by legislation. In its final
                    report entitled “Contracts for the Sale and Purchase of Land:
                    Purchasers’ Remedies” (Final Report No 97, October 2009)
                    (“Final Report No 97”), the Alberta Board recommended that
                    the decision in <em>Semelhago</em> should be statutorily
                    reversed and that land should be conclusively deemed to be unique for the
                    purposes of obtaining specific performance. This approach was thought to be
                    necessary as it would avoid the inherent uncertainties of an assessment of
                    damages and would put the prospective purchaser in a land contract in the
                    precise position that he would have been in had the contract been performed. To
                    buttress its position, ECI observed that the inherent difficulty of assessing
                    damages for land contracts was recognised by our High Court in <em>Ong Hien Yeow and another v Central Chambers LLC and
                        another</em> [2011] 1 SLR 1186.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     ECI further submitted that in the present
                    case, the quantification of the damages to be awarded to it in lieu of specific
                    performance would be especially difficult as it had sought to purchase the
                    Property for development. According to ECI, damages should not be computed
                    solely by reference to the difference between the market value of the Property
                    at the material time and the purchase price of $20m stated in the First Option,
                    but should also take into account the profit that ECI would have earned had it
                    sold the Property after developing it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Additionally, ECI argued that if specific
                    performance were denied to a prospective purchaser in a land contract on the
                    basis that the land in question had not been shown to be unique or that the
                    prospective purchaser was a property developer or speculator, it would mean that
                    such a purchaser’s rights would be nothing more than a personal right
                    against the vendor. The prospective purchaser would have no interest in land
                    capable of protection by way of a caveat, and might not even be entitled to
                    lodge a caveat against the property even though he had been granted an option to
                    purchase the property. There would also be wider repercussions in that the land
                    register would no longer afford protection to prospective purchasers, who, given
                    the prevalence of condominium and strata developments in Singapore, would
                    constitute a substantial portion of the users of the land register. In short,
                    ECI contended that following the principle laid down in <em>Semelhago</em> would lead to the creation of a new rule <em>vis-à-vis</em> the availability (or otherwise) of specific
                    performance to property developers or speculators who viewed land as a fungible
                    good. A party who intended to purchase property for personal enjoyment would be
                    in a better position than one who intended to purchase property for purposes
                    other than self-occupation, and that would contravene the fundamental legal
                    principle of equality of law as well as the equitable maxim that “equity
                    is equality” (see generally Paul J Brenner, “Specific
                    Performance of Contracts for the Sale of Land Purchased for Resale or Investment
                    for Resale or Investment” (1978) 24 McGill LJ 513 (“the 1978
                    McGill Law Journal article”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In response to ECI’s submissions, Thomas
                    Chan pointed out that the recommendations contained in Final Report No 97
                    had not been accepted and enacted into law, and that the Canadian courts had
                    continued to apply the principle laid down in <em>Semelhago</em>. He contended that it was not true that adopting the
                    principle established in <em>Semelhago</em> would create
                    unwarranted uncertainty, citing, in support of his argument, <em>Sharpe</em> at para 8.90 (also quoted by the Judge at [103] of the Judgment), which states that
                    “[c]ertainty is not the only legal value worth pursuing in the remedial
                    context”. What <em>Semelhago</em> did, according to
                        <em>Sharpe</em> at para 8.60, was “not to
                    replace the presumption of uniqueness with the presumption of replaceability,
                    but … to open the door to a critical inquiry as to the nature and
                    function of the property in relation to the prospective purchaser”. Where
                    the prospective purchaser’s interest in a particular piece of property was
                    in relation to investment or resale, the proposition that a substitute for the
                    property could not be found and, therefore, damages would be inadequate was
                    dubious and specific performance would be refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     As for Orion, it pointed out that the English
                    courts’ reservation of a special position for land (<em>ie</em>, that land was unique and damages would not be an adequate
                    remedy) derived from socio-political factors. As explained by David Cohen in his
                    article “The Relationship of Contractual Remedies to Political and Social
                    Status: A Preliminary Inquiry” (1982) 32 Univ of Toronto LJ 31, land
                    in pre-industrial England accorded its owner the right to vote and also granted
                    its owner considerable political influence; therefore, damages were never
                    adequate because of the intangible rights and social status that each parcel of
                    land in England conferred upon its owner. Orion submitted that those
                    considerations had no application in modern-day Singapore. Moreover, the vibrant
                    real estate market in modern society meant that land was more easily and readily
                    valued as compared to the past. Orion pointed out that even Paul J Brenner,
                    one of the proponents of granting specific performance as a matter of course for
                    land contracts, had recognised in the 1978 McGill Law Journal article (see
                        <a href="#p1_82">[82]</a> above) that where the property
                    involved was intended to be purchased for resale or speculative purposes with
                    the sole view of making a quick profit in a short period of time, damages would
                    be easily quantifiable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     It appears that the Canadian courts have
                    recognised that land today is no longer tied to the attributes which might have
                    driven the <em>almost</em> automatic availability of
                    specific performance for land contracts in the past, and have, accordingly,
                    taken what seems like an increasingly principled approach in areas where the
                    rigid application of the orthodox position (as set out at <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a> above) has sometimes outstripped its true
                    purpose (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Domowicz et
                        al v Orsa Investments Ltd</em> (1993) 15 OR (3d) 661). An
                    earlier case where this more principled approach was canvassed and adopted was
                    the Ontario High Court case of <em>Heron Bay Investments Ltd v
                        Peel-Elder Developments Ltd</em> (1976) 2 CPC 338, where it was
                    noted (at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>) that the reasoning behind the
                    grant of specific performance for land contracts did not apply in instances
                    where land was purchased merely as an investment for the purposes of development
                    and resale at a profit. In such cases, any loss of profits could obviously be
                    compensated in damages (see also <em>Chaulk v Fairview
                        Construction Limited</em> (1977) 33 APR 13 and the more recent
                    case of <em>Neretlis v Meade</em> [2005] OJ 638 at
                        [42]–[43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     We also note that the Canadian courts are not
                    alone in adopting this restrictive approach. In <em>Landco Albany
                        Ltd v Fu Hao Construction Ltd</em> [2006] 2 NZLR 174, the New
                    Zealand Court of Appeal denied specific performance as the party seeking this
                    remedy only had a “plainly commercial rather than private or sentimental
                    [interest]” (at [43]) in the
                    property in question. Since that party had entered into the transaction for
                    profit-making purposes, it was found that damages would be an adequate
                    remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Interestingly, the seeds of this restrictive
                    approach towards the grant of specific performance for land contracts were sowed
                    in the much earlier case of <em>Loan Investment Corporation of
                        Australasia v Bonner</em> [1970] NZLR 724, a decision of the Privy
                    Council on an appeal from New Zealand. In that case, the purchaser sought
                    specific performance of a contract for the sale and purchase of a parcel of land
                    at the price of £13,300, with a provision for £11,000 of the purchase
                    money to be lent to the purchaser for a ten-year term. The Privy Council
                    reversed (by a majority of 4:1) the New Zealand Court of Appeal’s decision
                    that specific performance would be granted as of right since the contract in
                    question was for the sale of land. Lord Pearson (delivering the judgment of
                    the majority of the Privy Council) held that specific performance would be
                    denied as the agreement was a “composite contract … predominantly
                    in the nature of a commercial bargain” (at 735). The majority of the
                    Privy Council found that, on the facts, the provision for a loan to the
                    purchaser was not the ancillary but the principal transaction, and, thus,
                    damages would be a sufficient and suitable remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ submissions on the Judge’s reasons for
                declining to grant ECI specific performance of the Sale Agreement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     We now move on to the parties’
                    submissions on the Judge’s reasons for declining to grant ECI specific
                    performance of the Sale Agreement in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Damages would be an adequate remedy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     We begin with the Judge’s ruling that
                    damages would be an adequate remedy for ECI. It is well-established that where a
                    defendant is not “good for his money” (so to speak), the court
                    will take this factor into account in deciding whether to grant a decree of
                    specific performance in favour of the plaintiff (see <em>Chitty
                        on Contracts</em> (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    30th Ed, 2008) at vol 1, para 27­-008). ECI reminded this court
                    that if it were denied specific performance of the Sale Agreement, it would be
                    left with nothing but an unsecured claim against an insolvent
                debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In our view, it is necessary to take a closer
                    look at the validity of ECI’s assertion. In its application in Summons
                    No 2585 of 2010 to discharge HLF as a party to OS 1357, ECI sought,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the following order:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That the proceeds of any mortgagee’s sale of the Property …
                        that may be conducted by [HLF] be paid into Court, less the money and
                        liability secured by the mortgage and the costs incurred by [HLF] in
                        defending [the] action …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This, counsel for Thomas Chan argued, showed that ECI was content to
                    let HLF sell the Property and to maintain its claim only against the remainder
                    of the sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Equally germane in this regard is ECI’s
                    conduct during the period leading up to the September 2009 Settlement and the
                    November 2009 Settlement. It clearly shows that ECI was at all times amenable to
                    giving up its entitlement to the Property in return for monetary compensation,
                    provided the quantum was right. Thus, its assertion now that damages alone would
                    not be an adequate remedy rings hollow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">ECI did not come to equity with “clean hands”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     As stated at (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) sub-para (c) of <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, one of the Judge’s reasons for refusing ECI
                    the remedy of specific performance was that it had not approached the court with
                    “clean hands”. In this regard, it is trite that any conduct which
                    disentitles a party from equitable relief must stem from the facts relied upon
                    to invoke the court’s conscience. In other words, the conduct complained
                    of must have an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sued for, and it
                    must be a depravity in the legal as well as moral sense (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 9(2) (LexisNexis,
                    2003) at para 110.016).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In I C F Spry, <em>The Principles of Equitable Remedies: Specific Performance,
                        Injunctions, Rectification and Equitable Damages</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 8th<sup> </sup>Ed, 2010) (“Spry’s
                        <em>Equitable Remedies</em>”), the learned
                    author opines at p 246 that the cases in which an applicant is denied
                    specific performance generally fall in two main categories, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_a"></a>(a)     cases where the applicant has
                        materially misled the court or abused its process, or has attempted to do so
                        (an example given by the author is the conscious making to the court of a
                        material statement which is untrue); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_93-p2_b"></a>(b)     cases where the grant of specific performance
                        would enable the applicant to achieve a dishonest purpose and would, in all
                        the circumstances, be inequitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In the present case, the Judge found that ECI
                    did not come to court with “clean hands” because: (a) the
                    purchase price of $20m, being at a gross undervalue, would cause hardship to
                    Ridout; (b) ECI initiated OS 1357 without making full disclosure of
                    the material facts as to how the First Option came to be exercised (in
                    particular, no mention was made of the Deed of Settlement); and (c) ECI
                    failed to make timely discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     ECI took issue with the Judge’s finding
                    (at sub-para (a) of [114] of the
                    Judgment) that it had sought to purchase the Property at an undervalued price
                    which had no relation to the then market value of the Property. It contended
                    that its act of negotiating a deal for its own benefit could not be an
                    inequitable or unconscionable act as it was under no legal duty to do otherwise
                    (citing <em>Beckkett v Deutsche Bank</em> at [114]). On the other hand, the three
                    respondents argued that ECI’s argument wholly missed the point, <em>viz</em>, that the Judge’s view was that:
                    (a) there was inequitable conduct on the part of ECI in insisting on
                    carrying through the Transaction when it clearly knew that the parties never
                    intended for it to be an actual sale of the Property by Ridout to ECI;
                    (b) it was totally illogical for Anwar to agree to a purchase price which
                    was significantly lower than both the open market value and the forced sale
                    value of the Property; and (c) the common intention of the parties could
                    not have been to truly enter into an agreement for the sale of the Property to
                    ECI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     We have, at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>–<a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above,
                    explained why we do not share the Judge’s view that Ridout did not intend
                    to grant to ECI (via the First Option) a genuine option (although cancellable by
                    Ridout within the 60-Day Period) to purchase the Property. For the same reasons,
                    Ridout must be taken to have agreed to sell the Property to ECI at the price of
                    $20m. It is not for the court to review, <em>ex post
                        facto</em>, the reasonableness of a transaction freely concluded
                    between (what are essentially) two commercial entities. The court should not
                    substitute its views on commercial wisdom for those of the contracting parties,
                    especially in a case like the present where both parties (<em>viz</em>, Anwar acting via Ridout, and KC Tan and Poh acting via
                    ECI) are men of business. It must be borne in mind that the property market at
                    the material time was very much affected by the unprecedented global financial
                    collapse. The real effects of that financial collapse on the Singapore property
                    market were not something which any person could reasonably predict at that
                    time. We should not use the benefit of hindsight to determine the wisdom of the
                    Transaction. Perhaps because of the then uncertainty in the property market, ECI
                    acted cautiously (by offering a low price for the Property); or, alternatively,
                    knowing of Anwar’s financial desperation, ECI tried to
                    “squeeze” him, which was what the Judge thought was the case (see
                        [30] of the Judgment). Whatever
                    might have been the case, ECI’s conduct in driving down the purchase price
                    of the Property as much as it could was neither legally improper nor
                    unconscionable. Thus, on the question of the low purchase price of the Property
                    alone, there is, in our view, nothing “unclean” on that account in
                    ECI seeking to enforce the Sale Agreement. We would reiterate that both parties
                    were represented in the Transaction by solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Similarly, we do not think that there was
                    really any material lack of candour on the part of ECI in commencing
                    OS 1357 without mentioning the Deed of Settlement. This is because after
                    the expiry of the 60-Day Period, Ridout’s right to cancel the First Option
                    lapsed, with the consequential effect that the Deed of Settlement became spent.
                    It was not really wrong for ECI to take the view that the Deed of Settlement was
                    irrelevant to its claim for specific performance of the Sale
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Before we move away from this sub-issue as to
                    whether ECI approached the court with “clean hands”, we ought to
                    address the Judge’s adverse comments on ECI’s conduct in making late
                    discovery of the litigation search conducted on Anwar as well as the documents
                    relating to the settlement negotiations between the parties. On this, we do not
                    think that the following explanation offered by ECI lacked reasonableness:
                    Ridout did not take any issue with the litigation search until Anwar’s
                    AEIC was filed on 25 June 2010. ECI gave discovery of the litigation search
                    on 30 June 2010 after Orion, by way of letters dated 23 and 28 June
                    2010, requested for copies of all searches conducted by ECI in connection with
                    its intended purchase of the Property. As for the documents relating to the
                    parties’ settlement negotiations, the point made by ECI was that those
                    negotiations had been conducted on a “without prejudice” basis and
                    it therefore thought the documents ought not to be disclosed. In any event, upon
                    the appointment of Rajah &amp; Tann LLP as its solicitors, ECI did provide full
                    discovery of all the relevant documents. All the purported
                    “omissions” on ECI’s part <em>vis-à-vis</em> discovery were rectified before the start of the trial
                    and none of the three respondents complained that it was taken by
                    surprise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Estoppel by acquiescence applied to ECI</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Estoppel by acquiescence was another factor
                    relied on by the Judge in deciding not to grant ECI specific performance (see
                    sub-para (e) of both <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> and <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above). ECI argued that the Judge erred in
                    holding that estoppel by acquiescence would apply following from (<em>inter alia</em>) the November 2009 Settlement. It averred
                    that under the terms of that settlement, the settlement sum of $5m was to be
                    paid upfront (to be precise, by noon on 16 November 2009), and not only
                    upon the completion of the sale of the Property to another purchaser. As the
                    payment did not materialise by the stipulated deadline, ECI was entitled to
                    enforce its rights under the Sale Agreement (the First Option having been
                    exercised on 27 August 2009). Given that it was an express term of the
                    November 2009 Settlement that ECI could proceed with the purchase of the
                    Property should Ridout fail to comply with the terms of that settlement, it was
                    plainly impermissible for the Judge to infer an estoppel by
                acquiescence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In this regard, ECI also submitted that the
                    Judge erred in inferring an estoppel by acquiescence from the fact that it did
                    not object or protest when informed that Ridout was trying to sell the Property
                    to another purchaser. ECI explained that its lack of response to this news was
                    because it saw no cause for it to object or protest since it already had a valid
                    agreement to purchase the Property and had also lodged two caveats against the
                    Property to protect its interest therein. In any event, ECI submitted, it should
                    not be deprived of its legal rights simply because it had not warned Ridout to
                    refrain from doing something that Ridout could not legally have done: as long as
                    ECI’s caveats remained, Ridout could not have validly sold the Property to
                    another purchaser. ECI also pointed out that when it learnt on 3 November
                    2009 of the grant of the Second Option to Thomas Chan, its solicitors
                    immediately wrote to Ridout’s solicitors on 4 November 2009 to
                    register its objection and stated that ECI “was now compelled to seek
                    legal recourse by way of specific performance”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> This, ECI contended, was clearly
                    not the conduct of a prospective purchaser who had allegedly acquiesced to the
                    sale of the Property to another party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In response to the above arguments by ECI,
                    Ridout contended that it had relied on ECI’s representation that it could
                    look for other buyers. This followed as a result of Ridout’s failure to
                    have the First Option cancelled and Ridout’s appeal to ECI not to exercise
                    that option. Ridout submitted that its detrimental reliance on ECI’s
                    conduct was evidenced by its having incurred time and expenditure in searching
                    for an alternative purchaser, as well as liability to Thomas Chan and any
                    intermediaries involved in the grant of the Second Option. Ridout also argued
                    that while it was no doubt true that ECI’s solicitors wrote to
                    Ridout’s solicitors on 4 November 2009 to object after ECI found out
                    (on 3 November 2009) that the Second Option had been granted to Thomas
                    Chan, that letter was, at best, a perfunctory letter. Thereafter, further
                    negotiations between the parties continued, culminating in the November 2009
                    Settlement. Ridout submitted that it would be inequitable for ECI to renege on
                    its position and feign ignorance of the sale to Thomas Chan, which it had
                    acquiesced to (citing <em>Lam Chi Kin David v Deutsche Bank
                        AG</em> [2010] 2 SLR 896).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    As for Orion and Thomas Chan, they submitted
                    that in the light of the subsequent agreements reached between ECI and Ridout
                    after 11 August 2009 (the date on which ECI rejected Ridout’s
                    purported cancellation of the First Option) to allow Anwar to seek another
                    purchaser for the Property and to pay ECI much higher compensation in return,
                    the First Option, which formed the basis of ECI’s claim for specific
                    performance, fell away and, as such, the Judge was correct in holding that
                    ECI’s claim for specific performance must fail as ECI’s rights under
                    the First Option (if any) would have been superseded by the subsequent
                    settlement agreements (<em>viz</em>, the September 2009
                    Settlement and the November 2009 Settlement).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on whether specific performance of the Sale Agreement
                should be granted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In the light of the discussion above, it can
                    be seen that <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Second Main Issue, we
                    are not in agreement with two of the Judge’s grounds for refusing to grant
                    ECI specific performance of the Sale Agreement: one, that the Transaction was
                    “unclean” because of the extremely low purchase price of the
                    Property; and two, that ECI had not approached the court with “clean
                    hands” because it had suppressed material information and had been late
                    in making discovery. However, apart from these two aspects, we are in agreement
                    with the Judge’s holding that in the circumstances of this case, specific
                    performance of the Sale Agreement should not be granted to ECI. In coming to
                    this conclusion, we do not find it necessary, on the basis of the prevailing
                    facts, to rely upon the more restrictive approach towards the grant of specific
                    performance for land contracts espoused in the Canadian and the New Zealand
                    cases. As specific performance is an equitable and discretionary remedy, the
                    court must, in any event, take into consideration all the circumstances of the
                    case at hand in order to ensure that it would be just and equitable to grant the
                    relief. In the present case, the following considerations are, in our view,
                    germane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    First, we note that after ECI exercised the
                    First Option on 27 August 2009, it was quite content to forego its right to
                    acquire the Property if the compensation offered to it was right. This is shown
                    by the fact that following the improvement in the property market during that
                    period, the compensation demanded by ECI escalated from $180,000 (as set out in
                    the Deed of Settlement) to $3.5m under the September 2009 Settlement, and
                    subsequently, to $5m under the November 2009 Settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Second, in line with its desire for a
                    settlement if the compensation offered was right, ECI implicitly permitted
                    Ridout to look for other buyers as ECI knew quite clearly that Ridout/Anwar had
                    no other means to pay the compensation demanded except by selling the Property
                    to another person. We agree with the Judge’s observations that:
                    (a) “it [was] clear [ECI] was happy not to proceed with completion
                    and was trying to seek some kind of quick turnaround and large payout”
                    (see [108] of the Judgment); and
                    (b) “[ECI] by its conduct after 11 August 2009 clearly led
                    [Anwar] to believe that it agreed, for a higher ‘compensation’, to
                    allow [Anwar] to look for another buyer and … would not proceed to
                    complete the purchase of the Property” (see [120] of the
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Third, there should have been a happy ending
                    under the November 2009 Settlement, but it was not to be. It is true that by
                    JLC’s letter to TLP of 11 November 2009, Ridout agreed to pay ECI the
                    sum of $5m by noon on 16 November 2009, but, as things turned out, Ridout
                    could not raise that sum in time. Its request for a mere two-day extension to
                    make payment was rejected. We agree with the Judge’s finding (at [115] of
                    the Judgment) that ECI did not agree to this extension “because of the
                    significant rise in property prices and decided to go for a bigger payout, by
                    claiming the Property itself”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Fourth, during the hearing of the present
                    appeals, counsel for ECI brought it to our attention that in the event of our
                    ruling that the Transaction was indeed for the sale of the Property by Ridout to
                    ECI, this court should order that the transfer of the Property to Thomas Chan
                    (which was effected on 17 December 2010 following the judgment of the court
                    below) be undone. It is trite that an appeal does not operate as a stay of
                    execution (see s 41 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,
                    2007 Rev Ed) and O 57 r 15(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Rules of Court). Although ECI’s failure/omission to apply for a stay
                    of the transfer of the Property to Thomas Chan does not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> disentitle it from praying to this court for specific
                    performance of the Sale Agreement, its failure/omission in this regard is a
                    factor which the court can take into account in determining fairness and in
                    exercising its discretion to grant or refuse specific performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Fifth, and more importantly, we note that
                    Orion has a charge over the balance of the sale proceeds of the Property (after
                    the satisfaction of HLF’s prior interest) as security for its loan of $10m
                    to Anwar (see, <em>inter alia</em>, <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). Tremendous hardship would be suffered by Orion
                    should specific performance of the Sale Agreement be granted to ECI as the
                    Property would then be sold to ECI for a mere $20m. There would, in that
                    scenario, be very little money left from the sale proceeds of the Property for
                    Orion after HLF has taken its share of the sale proceeds as mortgagee. This
                    would be extremely unfair to Orion. On the other hand, Orion would not suffer
                    any hardship if the sale of the Property to Thomas Chan is allowed to stand,
                        <em>ie</em>, if ECI is refused specific performance.
                    Hardship to a third party is a factor which the court can take into
                    consideration in determining whether to grant specific performance (see
                    Spry’s <em>Equitable Remedies</em> at
                    pp 201–203). This ground for refusing specific performance generally
                    applies to the sale or mortgage of limited or part interests in immovable
                    property where the sale of the entire property in question might prejudice the
                    rights of other persons beneficially interested in that property. For example, a
                    subsequent purchaser who has contracted to purchase land from the vendor may
                    suffer hardship if the earlier purchaser is granted specific performance (for
                    instance, the subsequent purchaser may have spent money on improvements to the
                    land (see <em>Mitz v Wiseman et al; Strathalian Beach
                        Association, Third Party</em> (1971) 22 DLR (3d) 513; see
                    also <em>Jones &amp; Goodhart</em> at pp 112 and
                    121–122)). That said, we also note that such hardship may not necessarily
                    arise in every instance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    An example of when it would be appropriate
                    to refuse specific performance on the ground of hardship to a third party can be
                    found in <em>Wroth and Another v Tyler</em> [1974]
                    Ch 30. In that case, the defendant agreed to sell a bungalow to the
                    plaintiff. Unknown to the plaintiff, the defendant’s wife, who was unhappy
                    with the arrangement, registered her right of occupation under s 1(1) of
                    the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967 (c 75) (UK) (“the Matrimonial Homes
                    Act”) the day after the contract was concluded. The defendant, being
                    unable to complete the sale in view of his unsuccessful attempts to persuade his
                    wife to remove her notice from the register, informed the plaintiff that he was
                    unable to complete and offered to pay damages instead. The plaintiff issued a
                    writ seeking specific performance of the agreement and damages in lieu of or in
                    addition to specific performance, together with other reliefs. The agreed
                    evidence before the court showed that the bungalow was worth £7,500 at the
                    date fixed for completion and £11,500 at the date of the hearing.
                    Megarry J held that an order for specific performance subject to the
                    wife’s right of occupation could lead to the defendant’s family
                    being split up because although s 1(1) of the Matrimonial Homes Act
                    protected the defendant’s wife against eviction, it gave no protection to
                    either the defendant or the couple’s daughter, and they, especially the
                    defendant, might well be liable to eviction by the plaintiff after completion.
                    Given those circumstances, Megarry J stated that if any reasonable
                    alternative existed, the court should be slow to make an order for specific
                    performance. Megarry J eventually awarded the plaintiff damages of
                    £5,500 (assessed as at 11 January 1973) in lieu of specific
                    performance. This case was applied in <em>Clark and another v
                        Lucas Solicitors LLP</em> [2010] 2 All ER 955.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In this connection, it should be noted that
                    hardship to one of the parties to a land contract (as opposed to hardship to a
                    third party) can also be a ground for refusing specific performance. This can be
                    seen from <em>Dowsett v Reid</em> (1912) 15 CLR 695, a
                    decision of the High Court of Australia. In that case, the appellant sought to
                    lease his land (and the structures thereon) to the respondent, who also had an
                    option to purchase the land, on terms which later turned out to be totally
                    unfavourable to the appellant. The appellant repudiated the agreement. The
                    respondent’s claim for specific performance succeeded at first instance.
                    On appeal to the High Court of Australia, the court allowed the appeal and
                    substituted the order for specific performance with damages. Griffith CJ,
                    clearly moved by the argument that an order for specific performance should be
                    weighed against the great hardship that might result, stated that “[t]he
                    Court [was] not bound to enforce a bargain which would work great hardship upon
                    either party” (at 706).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Reverting to the present appeals, having
                    regard to the totality of the considerations discussed at <a href="#p1_104">[104]</a>–<a href="#p1_110">[110]</a> above, particularly the fact that the grant of specific
                    performance to ECI would be unfair and would cause great hardship to Orion, we
                    do not think that it would be just and equitable to grant such relief to ECI. In
                    the context of this case, damages would be an adequate remedy for
                ECI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    As regards ECI’s argument that Ridout
                    is no longer good for its money, we can do no better than quote what the Judge
                    said in this regard at [110] of the
                    Judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [ECI] <em>knew</em> of [Anwar]’s
                        financial position, sought security for its loan, used the fact that there
                        were many actions taken out against [Anwar] as a credit risk and took the
                        risk to lend money to [Anwar], albeit through [Ridout], for a handsome
                        reward [in the form of the $180,000 compensation fee] in the first instance
                        and a windfall in the second and third “agreements” [<em>ie</em>, the September 2009 Settlement and the November
                        2009 Settlement]. It chose to take the risk of allowing [Ridout] to look for
                        a second buyer to enable it to reap those windfalls and having so chosen, it
                        now must face the consequences of the risk materialising. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Finally, before we conclude, we ought to
                    mention that <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Second Main Issue, ECI
                    also raised other arguments before this court, <em>eg</em>,
                    that it was entitled to the proceeds of sale paid by Thomas Chan under a
                    constructive trust, and that the Judge was unduly sympathetic towards Thomas
                    Chan. In the light of our decision, we do not see how a constructive trust could
                    arise in favour of ECI; neither is the question of sympathy to Thomas Chan
                    relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In the result, CA 177 is dismissed
                    because although we find (contrary to the Judge’s ruling) that the
                    Transaction was genuinely for the sale of the Property by Ridout to ECI, we
                    agree with the Judge that it is not appropriate to grant ECI specific
                    performance of the Sale Agreement in the present case. There shall, instead, be
                    an assessment of the damages suffered by ECI as a result of Ridout’s
                    failure to honour the Sale Agreement. As regards CA 184, in view of our
                    decision in CA 177, it must also be dismissed. On the question of the
                    appropriate order on costs, the parties are to let us have their submissions in
                    writing within one week from the date of this judgment.</p>
