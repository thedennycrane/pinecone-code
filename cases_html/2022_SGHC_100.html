</div> As such, their case was that the Minister had failed to discharge this burden. At the hearing of OS 856 on 11 September 2020, I ordered the matter to be adjourned pending CA 47/2020 and CA 52/2020, where substantially similar arguments were made regarding the constitutionality of POFMA before the Court of Appeal (“the CA”) as well as other arguments. Consequently, the CA released <span class="font-italic">The Online Citizen Pte Ltd v Attorney-General and another appeal and other matters </span>[2021] 2 SLR 1358 (“<span class="font-italic">TOC v AG</span>”), which upheld the constitutionality of POFMA having applied the test in <span class="font-italic">Wham Kwok Han </span><span class="font-italic">Jolovan v PP </span>[2021] 1 SLR 476: at [55]–[112]. The CA also ruled on the burden of proof and the standard of proof. Following this, counsel for SDP indicated that it would not be pursuing its arguments on the constitutionality of POFMA, nor any arguments regarding the applicable burden and standard of proof in setting aside applications under s 17 POFMA.

While O 28 r 2 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) stipulated that “[a]ll originating summonses shall be heard in Chambers”, this was subject to, among other things, “any written law (or) any directions of the Court”.

In the earlier POFMA appeal before Ang Cheng Hock J (reported in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Democratic Party v Attorney-General </span>[2020] SGHC 25 (“<span class="font-italic">SDP v AG</span> (<span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> CH J</span>)”), Dr Chee Soon Juan (“Dr Chee”), who represented SDP, argued that POFMA appeals ought to be heard in open court as, among others, a threshold of public interest had to be satisfied before a CD could be issued under POFMA. In meeting this argument, the DAG submitted as follows:

We don’t dispute that, that’s correct. Two points I make. Number one, just because public interest, that’s not special reason. But, effectively, what Dr Chee is arguing, that because every POFMA decision involves a public interest, therefore every POFMA decision should be heard in open court. That’s effectively what he’s arguing. <span class="font-weight-bold">Because the public interest threshold will clearly be met in every POFMA direction.</span> If that is the case, then one would have expected that the Registrar or [POFMA] would provide for all POFMA matters to be heard in open court. But clearly, the contrary is true. That as far as the Act is concerned and the Rules of Court are concerned, they do not treat POFMA applications any different from any other [originating summonses] … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 As was apparent from the above passage, the DAG was not saying, as Mr Nair posited, that “[b]ecause the public interest threshold will clearly be met in every POFMA direction”, POFMA appeals ought to be heard in open court. Instead, the DAG was merely summarising Dr Chee’s argument, and in addressing the argument, he then said that “[i]f that is the case, then one would have expected that the Registrar or [POFMA] would provide for all POFMA matters to be heard in open court. <span class="font-italic">But clearly, the contrary is true</span>” [emphasis added]. Seen in the appropriate context, the DAG’s comments could not be seen as supporting the proposition that POFMA appeals ought to be heard in open court because the Minister must be “of the opinion that it is in the public interest to issue the Direction” (s 10(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of POFMA) before a CD is issued. To the contrary, the DAG was making the point that simply because “public interest” is engaged did not mean that all POFMA appeals must be heard in open court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Counsel for the Attorney-General (“AG”), Ms Kristy Tan <span class="font-italic">SC</span> (“Ms Tan”), emphasised that the starting point remained O 28 r 2 of the ROC, which sets out the default position for <span class="font-italic">all </span>originating summonses:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">All </span>originating summonses shall be heard in <span class="font-italic">Chambers</span>, subject to any express provision of these Rules, any written law, any directions of the Court or any practice directions for the time being issued by the Registrar. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 According to Ms Tan, if Mr Nair’s arguments were accepted, it would establish a general principle that POFMA appeals ought to be heard in open court, as opposed to in chambers. But such a general principle was not supported by the statutory provisions. Under r 5(1) of the POFMA Rules, all POFMA appeals to the High Court “<span class="font-italic">must </span>be brought by <span class="font-italic">originating summons</span>” [emphasis added]. While r 4(2) of the POFMA Rules explicitly sets out specific provisions in the ROC (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>O 28 r 2A of the ROC) which do <span class="font-italic">not </span>apply to POFMA appeals, it was pertinent to note that O 28 r 2 of the ROC is <span class="font-italic">not </span>excluded. Hence, Ms Tan submitted that there was no predisposition for POFMA appeals to be heard in chambers or in open court. Rather, reading O 28 r 2 of the ROC with the POFMA Rules (which do not provide for a derogation from the default rule in O 28 r 2), the default position was that a POFMA appeal, which was to be initiated by originating summons, was to be heard in chambers unless the court directed otherwise. In so far as r 11 of the POFMA Rules (set out at [9] above) provides for the Court to conduct the hearing of a POFMA appeal in such manner as the Court thinks fit, this is not inconsistent with O 28 r 2 of the ROC, which reserves to the court the discretion to depart from the default position in an appropriate case.

In response, the AG applied, by summons in chambers, to dismiss the plaintiff’s application, and for the plaintiff to pay the AG’s costs. Before Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the AG’s application should be heard in open court, rather than in chambers, as it was in the public interest that proceedings of such nature be heard in open court. Phang JA had “no hesitation” in rejecting the argument for a <span class="font-italic">general </span>rule to this effect. Nevertheless, in view of the close link between the AG’s application and the plaintiff’s substantive application to have the results of the General Election declared null and void (which was already scheduled to be heard in open court), the judge ruled that there was sufficient public interest to justify holding the hearing of the AG’s application in open court with the plaintiff’s substantive application. However, the court cautioned that the decision “sets no precedent for the future” (<span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin (Phang JA) </span>at [8]).

The plaintiffs submitted that the usual practice of hearing an originating summons in chambers ought to be departed from as the originating summons raised constitutional issues that were of public interest, and as it was connected to two defamation suits involving politicians. Belinda Ang Saw Ean J declined the application, finding that the reasons were not compelling enough to warrant a departure from the norm. In the judge’s view, the questions raised in the originating summons were “plainly questions of law and, as such, any written judgment on the matter would serve as a sufficient record of the proceedings in chambers” (at [15]). It was also noted that in <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span><span class="font-italic"> Joshua Benjamin v Attorney-General </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 590, the hearing of an originating summons concerning the seat of the plaintiff as a Member of Parliament was also conducted in chambers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In <span class="font-italic">Ravi s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Madasamy v Attorney-General and other matters </span>[2017] 5 SLR 489 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravi</span>”), the plaintiff applied by way of originating summons to challenge the Elected Presidency Scheme, arguing that it was contrary to certain aspects of the Constitution. Before the substantive hearing proper, the plaintiff applied, among others, for the proceedings to be heard in open court. In the main, it was argued that matters of public importance going to the heart of the Constitution were being surfaced by him in the public interest. The application was nonetheless dismissed by See Kee Oon J, who held that there was “no reason to depart from the general rule in O 28 r 2” of the ROC (at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 More recently, in <span class="font-italic">SDP v AG</span><span class="font-italic"> (Ang CH J)</span> (the first POFMA appeal raised to the High Court) and <span class="font-italic">Ong Ming Johnson v Attorney-General and other matters </span>[2020] SGHC 63 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Ming Johnson</span>”) (joint applications to have s 377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) declared unconstitutional), applications to have the matters heard in open court were similarly dismissed.

</div> While I am of the view that that was a factor that the court had taken into account, it was not the only factor.

</div> However, in my view, that point was neither here nor there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It seemed to me that Mr Nair’s attempts to distinguish the cases which Ms Tan relied on did not address Ms Tan’s central point which was that the starting position for an originating summons was as stated in O 28 r 2 of the ROC. I agree with her submission that POFMA could have excluded the application of this provision or specified that the starting position for a s 17 application under POFMA was to have the hearing in open court. That was not done (see [14] above). Accordingly, the argument of Mr Nair that POFMA is <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span>, for the purpose of having an open court hearing, was not persuasive. Leaving that argument aside, Mr Nair accepted that even if an issue was of public interest and/or even if a constitutional point was raised, that alone would not constitute a special reason to have an open court hearing.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The question thus turned to whether special reasons existed in the present appeal to warrant an open court hearing. Having considered the reasons proffered, I found that no such reasons existed, and accordingly dismissed the application to have the proceedings heard in open court. While the Subject Statement related to Singapore’s population, and the 4 July CD was issued during the election period, these did not go towards showing why it was in the public interest for the hearing to be heard in open court, as opposed to in chambers. At the highest, this meant that there would be interest from the public as to the arguments raised in the present appeal, but, as seen in the cases discussed at [18]–[20] above, a matter which is of interest to the public does not necessarily warrant an open court hearing. The novelty of the <span class="font-italic">legal </span>questions raised was also clearly inadequate – novel legal issues are often raised in originating summons proceedings, and yet the starting position for such proceedings to be heard in chambers is seldom departed from.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The substantive submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I turn next to the parties’ substantive submissions.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">SDP’s Case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 SDP advanced various points in its written submissions covering three proposed steps that the court should undertake.

It argued that it was a statement of opinion instead. It asserted that the first sentence of the Subject Statement essentially “states what was said by Dr Cheong”, and then <span class="font-italic">derives</span> the alleged population target of 10 million by multiplying the figure of 13,700 per sq km allegedly related by Dr Cheong by Singapore’s raw land mass.

I reproduce the framework below (<span class="font-italic">TOC v AG </span>at [163]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">163 …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court should determine the Minister’s intended meaning in respect of the subject statement that he has identified in the Part 3 Direction. This is to be done by construing the subject statement objectively in the light of the Direction as a whole. It is the subject statement <span class="font-italic">as understood according to the Minister’s intended meaning </span>which is the subject statement that the court is concerned with under the second to fifth steps of the analytical framework set out at sub-paras (b) to (e) below. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court should determine whether the subject material in fact makes or contains the subject statement (or statements) identified by the Minister in the Part 3 Direction. This should be done by: (i) interpreting the subject material objectively in its proper context, and as a matter of impression rather than of finegrained or unduly technical analysis; and (ii) asking whether, on that approach to the subject material, there would be at least an appreciable segment or a particular class of the potential readership or audience of the subject material in Singapore who would construe it as making or containing the subject statement, or regard the subject statement as a reasonable interpretation of the subject material. In undertaking this interpretive exercise, the court is not concerned with the single meaning rule, nor with the subjective intention of the statement-maker (including the meaning that it subjectively intended to place on the subject material). Furthermore, while considering the subject material as a whole, the court should be alive to the likelihood that the particular part of the subject material that is said to be or to give rise to the subject statement may be taken out of context from the subject material as a whole owing to factors such as “clickbait”, deceptive headlines, or forms of emphasis placed on that part of the subject material (such as through the use of outsized graphics). If the court determines that the subject material does not in fact make or contain the subject statement identified in the Part 3 Direction, the Direction may be set aside under s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the court should determine whether the identified subject statement is a “statement of fact” as defined in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA, in the sense that a reasonable person would consider it to be a representation of fact. An objective approach applies in this regard. If the court finds that the identified subject statement is not a statement of fact, the Part 3 Direction may be set aside under s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the court should determine, likewise on an objective approach, whether the identified subject statement is “false” in the sense explained in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA. If the court finds that the identified subject statement is not false, the Part 3 Direction may similarly be set aside under s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the court should consider whether the identified subject statement “has been or is being communicated in Singapore”, in the sense that it has been or is being published on or through the Internet, <span class="font-italic">and</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>has been or is being accessed by at least one end-user in Singapore, as stated in s 3(1) of the POFMA. If the element of communication is not present, the Part 3 Direction may be set aside under s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(In my analysis, I refer to the above steps as the first to fifth steps of the <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>Framework respectively).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It further held that the burden of proof in applications under s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) lies on the recipient of the CD in question. To this, the recipient of the CD has to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion that one or more of the grounds above was satisfied by putting forth material that might show an arguable case in favor of setting aside. If this threshold requirement was met, then the evidential burden shifts to the Minister to show that none of the grounds was made out. This was to be established on the civil standard of a balance of probabilities: <span class="font-italic">TOC v AG </span>at [180] to [184].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applying the TOC Framework </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Before applying the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework, I should first mention that SDP’s submissions were premised on SDP’s characterization of the Subject Statement as a mere report of Dr Cheong’s Statement. To this, it cited as evidence of Dr Cheong’s Statement a <span class="font-italic">written</span> <span class="font-italic">script</span> of the IPS Lecture which is set out at [4] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 While reliance was placed by both parties on this written script of the IPS Lecture as the basis for what Dr Cheong was alleged to have said, this may well <span class="font-italic">not have been what Dr Cheong had </span><span class="font-italic">actually said at the lecture itself</span>. Every page of the written script had come with the disclaimer to “check against delivery”. It became clear during the hearing of the present application on 28 March 2022 that neither party had checked the written script against what Dr Cheong had orally said at the IPS Lecture. Therefore, when reference is made to “Dr Cheong’s Statement”, this is based on the written script of the IPS Lecture and not what she may have orally said.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The first step in the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As it turned out, it did not matter who had the burden of proof. The Subject Statement was a repetition of the relevant part of the SDP Article. There was no dispute as to what the Subject Statement meant. The first step in the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework is easily undertaken. The Subject Statement meant that Dr Cheong had said that the population density over the entire land area of Singapore would increase from 11,000 people per sq km to 13,700 people per sq km between the time of Dr Cheong’s Statement to 2030. Given Singapore’s land area, Singapore’s population would increase to nearly 10 million by 2030.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my view, SDP’s First Proposed Step was incorrect. In arguing that the court should determine what Dr Cheong’s Statement means rather than what the Subject Statement means, SDP was proceeding on the premise that the Subject Statement was an accurate report of Dr Cheong’s Statement. However, that was precisely the point in contention. In the present case, the Minister did not agree that this was so. On the contrary, the Minister’s position was that the Subject Statement did not accurately reflect what Dr Cheong’s Statement said. Hence, the first step is to consider what the Subject Statement meant and not what Dr Cheong’s Statement meant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The second step in the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The second step in the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework is also easily undertaken on the facts before me. The subject material, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the SDP Article does contain the Subject Statement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On SDP’s Second Proposed Step, SDP submitted that the Basis Statement must “reasonably relate to the Subject Statement in question”.

This points towards an objective approach at this stage of the inquiry: <span class="font-italic">TOC</span><span class="font-italic"> v AG </span>at [158].

</div> SDP relied on paragraph 6B(xiii) of the Ministry of Law’s paper titled “How the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act applies” (“the MOL paper”), an article which sets out guiding illustrations and examples to how POFMA should apply. The pertinent paragraph reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The following are statements of opinion:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(xiii) N states that nine out of 10 jobs in Singapore went to foreigners, and sets out <span class="font-italic">his</span> <span class="font-italic">methodology</span> based on certain data that he refers to.

Ms Tan argued that in the second sentence of the Subject Statement, SDP was not purporting to convey its own opinion but allegedly what Dr Cheong had said. This was because the objective behind SDP’s post was to show that the idea of a 10 million population originated from the government, not SDP.

It bore the heading “Press Release” and the sub-heading “10 million population”. It then opened with the following line:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The idea of Singapore increasing its population to 10 million <span class="font-italic">did not originate from the SDP</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I am of the view that the second sentence of the Subject Statement was not an attempt by SDP to give its own opinion about what Dr Cheong’s Statement would mean. Rather, the entire Subject Statement purported to be a report of what Dr Cheong had said in Dr Cheong’s Statement. Hence, both sentences were statements of fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For completeness, I turn to SDP’s reliance on paragraph 6B(xiii) of the MOL Paper. It appears that SDP did not take into consideration the corresponding paragraph 6B(13), which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, for each of the respective examples above, if:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(13) In the case of [paragraph 6B(xiii)] above: N cites <span class="font-italic">data that is fabricated</span>, N’s statement is a false statement of fact. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Reading paragraphs 6B(xiii) and 6B(13) of the MOL Paper together, it appears that even if a subject statement were an opinion, it would still constitute a false statement of fact if it were based on false information. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the present case, since both sentences of the Subject Statement purported to be a report of Dr Cheong’s Statement, the question was whether the Subject Statement read as a whole was true or false. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 SDP submitted that if the terms “living density” and “population density” are used interchangeably, then the Subject Statement was factual and correct. It argued that the term “living density” has no ascertainable technical meaning and there is no discernible difference between the two phrases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 According to the AG, various parts of the Subject Statement were incorrect, making the Subject Statement false. First, Dr Cheong’s Statement referred to “living density” while the Subject Statement referred to “population density”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Secondly, and more importantly, aside from nomenclature, the density which Dr Cheong was referring to was density based on urban areas and not total land area. This was supported by a letter from Jaffrey Aw, HDB’s Director (Strategic Planning) dated 24 April 2018 (“Mr Aw’s Letter”) and what Ms Tan termed a “back of the envelope” calculation which I elaborate on below at [83].  However, the Subject Statement meant that the density that Dr Cheong was referring to was based on total land area. Hence, the second sentence of the Subject Statement took her figures and applied them to Singapore’s total land area to derive a population of nearly 10 million by 2030.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I am of the view that the Subject Statement was false.

</div>
</div>
</div> This article referred to the interaction between Mr Philemon and Dr Cheong (at [69]), and also quoted Mr Aw’s Letter in full.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 SDP referred to the TOC Article and argued that Dr Cheong had the opportunity to clarify Dr Cheong’s Statement when Mr Philemon posed his question but she refused to do so. I should mention that it was not a situation in which only one question was posed to Dr Cheong and she flatly refused to answer it. That was the impression that the heading of the TOC Article may have given. The heading reads: “HDB Chief refuses to answer opposition member’s question on planning principle behind high population density”. However, its contents showed that several questions were posed to Dr Cheong and she then chose some of those to respond to, which did not include Mr Philemon’s question. In any event, it was clear that Mr Philemon’s question was different from the question raised in Mr Cheang’s Forum Letter. Mr Philemon’s question was about the urban planning principle behind the higher population density. He was not asking what Singapore’s population would be by 2030 or at any time in the future. Hence, SDP’s reliance on the TOC Article was a red herring.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Indeed, it was telling that SDP chose to steer away from a more important document in its arguments. This was Mr Aw’s Letter. As can be seen, that letter made two clarifications. First, that the figures in Dr Cheong’s Statement pertained to living density and not population density. Secondly, that living density takes into account only the land available for urban areas and excludes other land such as land used for ports, airports, defence and utilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It was clear from that letter that the density which Dr Cheong’s Statement was referring to was not based on Singapore’s total land area but only on urban areas. This would be obvious to anyone reading that letter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 When Mr Nair was asked by the court to address that letter, he argued that there was no positive evidence to show that SDP was aware of this letter at all. It was not a valid argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 First, this letter was one of the documents which SDP itself had referred to in its application to cancel the 4 July CD. At that time, SDP had sought to argue why that letter was not helpful. If SDP had been unaware of the letter soon after it was published or before the SDP Article was published, SDP would have said so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Second, the contents of the letter were cited in the TOC Article which SDP itself was relying on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Third, in the Minister’s response to SDP’s application to the court, the response specifically mentioned that it was not SDP’s evidence that it was unaware of Mr Aw’s Letter. Importantly, SDP did not correct or take issue with that point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In the circumstances, it was not open to Mr Nair to suggest that SDP might not have been aware of Mr Aw’s Letter when SDP itself chose not to say so explicitly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The court is entitled to infer and I do infer that SDP was aware of Mr Aw’s Letter at all material times including around the date when it was published in the Straits Times and before SDP published the SDP Article.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 That letter is the first reason why the Subject Statement, considered as a whole, was a false statement of fact. It showed that the SDP Article had deliberately substituted “living density” in Dr Cheong’s Statement for “population density” in the SDP Article. More importantly, that letter showed that the density in Dr Cheong’s Statement was based on urban areas in Singapore and not Singapore’s total land area. Yet the SDP Article deliberately applied her figures to the latter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Thus, although Mr Nair argued that there was no evidence that “living density” was different from “population density”, that was not the point. Whether the terms were interchangeable or not, the explanation in Mr Aw’s Letter showed that the density in Dr Cheong’s Statement was referring to urban areas only. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The second reason why the Subject Statement was false was that if one were to apply the initial density in Dr Cheong’s Statement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 11,000 people per sq km to Singapore’s total land area of about 720 sq km, this would yield a figure of 7,920,000 persons at the time of the IPS Lecture. Ms Tan referred to this as a back of the envelope calculation and argued that Singapore’s population then was not even 6.9 million. Hence, SDP must have known that the density in Dr Cheong’s Statement could not be simply applied over Singapore’s total land area. Significantly, Mr Nair did not have any response to the argument about the back of the envelope calculation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 To the extent that Mr Nair submitted that SDP was not obliged to take into account Mr Aw’s Letter, the second reason does not depend on that letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In any event, I do not accept Mr Nair’s submission. Since the Subject Statement purported to be an accurate report of Dr Cheong’s Statement, it should have taken Mr Aw’s Letter into account. This is because the SDP Article was premised on Mr Cheang’s Forum Letter about Dr Cheong’s Statement. Mr Cheang’s Forum Letter did not assert that Singapore’s population would increase to nearly 10 million. He mentioned that as a question. Mr Aw’s Letter was in response to that question. It was incongruous for SDP to refer to Mr Cheang’s Forum Letter and ignore the response thereto. Furthermore, this was not a situation in which SDP had valid reason to doubt that Mr Aw’s Letter was issued on behalf of HDB. Neither did it have any reason to doubt the truth of what that letter was saying. Besides arguing that there was no distinction between “living density” and “population density”, SDP did not contend that Mr Aw’s Letter was in any way false or illogical. In the circumstances, this submission was also telling. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In oral arguments, Mr Nair referred to a different part of the written text of the IPS lecture which states:

For example, even though we have safeguarded a large tract of land in Tuas for our port, it could be phased to retain strategic flexibility, in case demand for port activities does not pan out as envisaged.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Building flexibility into our plans also requires us to develop plans which can accommodate a larger population. Dr Liu Thai Ker has advocated planning for a projected population of 10 million. His view has generated debate. No doubt, there will continue to be much discussion on what might be an appropriate population size for Singapore. This largely depends on whether we can find innovative urban solutions to sustain our good living environment, and on the level of acceptance by our citizenry.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Regardless of public sentiments, it is wise to plan for scenarios with varying population sizes, as it would help planners to anticipate the types of infrastructure that will be needed, the appropriate densities to build on available land, and to work through the many difficult trade-offs in allocating land amongst competing uses. If the population growth does not materialise, we would have a happy situation of having more land buffer set aside and more choices in the use of land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Mr Nair argued that this part supported SDP’s position that Dr Cheong’s Statement was referring to a population of 10 million by 2030.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It is clear to me that this part did not assist SDP in the least. Dr Liu Thai Ker (“Dr Liu”) was advocating planning for a projected population of 10 million. This is different from saying that the government was aiming for such a population. In any event, Dr Cheong’s Statement had nothing to do with a population of 10 million, regardless of what Dr Liu was advocating. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Finally, SDP relied on a Straits Times article dated 12 January 2022 titled “10 million population ‘not really ridiculous number’ for Singapore to plan for: Liu Thai Ker”, presumably to show that the government did in fact plan for a population target of 10 million. The article reported that at a panel discussion organized by the IPS on 11 January 2022, former chief city planner Dr Liu maintained that a population size of 10 million was not a ridiculous number for the government to plan for. Further, it was reported that fellow panellist, Mr George Yeo (“Mr Yeo”) (who is a former cabinet minister), said the following:

It assumed that Dr Cheong’s Statement was alluding to a population of 10 million. It used that statement to support its argument that this was the target of the Singapore government. Dr Liu’s and Mr Yeo’s comments were supposed to corroborate the argument that that was the target of the government. However, the point is that Dr Cheong’s Statement did not allude to a population of 10 million in the first place. That was the fundamental flaw in the SDP’s position in this entire application. For the purpose of this application, the court is not concerned whether there is other evidence that the Singapore government had a population target of 10 million but whether the Subject Statement was a false statement of fact in relation to Dr Cheong’s Statement.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The fifth step in the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The fifth step in the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework was not in issue. It was not disputed that the Subject Statement had been communicated in Singapore and had been accessed in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For the above reasons, SDP’s application under s 17 of the POFMA fails. Accordingly, OS 856 is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 On the issue of costs, Mr Nair submitted that where a s 17 POFMA application is dismissed, the default position is that no order on costs should be given unless the application was an abuse of the court’s process, or if the conduct of the appeal was done in an extravagant and unnecessary manner. He referred to r 15(2) of the POFMA Rules in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Rules 15(1) and (2) of the POFMA Rules state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.— (1) Subject to paragraph (2), an appellant that is an individual may not be ordered to pay any costs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The Court may order the appellant to pay the costs of, or incidental to, the appeal if the Court is satisfied that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the commencement, continuation or conduct of the appeal by the appellant was an abuse of the process of the Court; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the conduct of the appeal by the appellant was done in an extravagant and unnecessary manner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I agree with Ms Tan’s argument that Mr Nair’s reading of r 15 of the POFMA Rules is not correct. In my view, r 15(2) must be read in light of r 15(1), which provides that subject to r 15(2), an appellant that is an individual may not be ordered to pay costs. Therefore, the default position for an appellant that is an <span class="font-italic">individual</span> is indeed that no order on costs should be given; but nowhere in the Rules does it say that the same applies for an entity such as the appellant in this case. Costs continue to remain at the usual discretion of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the light of the reasons I have given, it is clear that SDP deliberately included the Subject Statement in the SDP Article, knowing that it was false. In the circumstances, SDP should pay the costs of OS 856. Having considered submissions on quantum, I order SDP to pay the AG costs of $7,000 and reasonable disbursements to be fixed by the court if not agreed between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Woo Bih Li <br/>Judge of the Appellate Division</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Suresh Nair (P K Wong &amp; Nair LLC) (instructed), Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam and Joel Wong En Jie (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Ruyan Kristy <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Pang Ru Xue, Jamie and Beulah Li Sile (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

The CD was issued in relation to a claim made by SDP through a Facebook post dated 3 July 2020 that Dr Cheong Koon Hean (“Dr Cheong”), the HDB chief executive at the time, had made certain representations about Singapore’s present and target population sizes. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 On 3 July 2020, amidst the ongoing national elections at the time, the SDP published a Facebook post titled “10 million population” (the “SDP Article”). According to the post, “the idea of Singapore increasing its population to 10 million did not originate from the SDP”. In support of SDP’s position, the post then said the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">Also, the HDB chief executive [Dr Cheong] said that Singapore’s population<span class="font-italic"> </span>density would increase from 11,000 people per sq km to 13,700 people per sq km between now and 2030. Given our land area, this means that our population would go up to nearly 10 million by 2030. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(“the Subject Statement”)</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Immediately after the above excerpt was a hyperlink referring readers to a letter posted to the Straits Times on 20 April 2018 by Mr Cheang Peng Wah (“Mr Cheang’s Forum Letter”), which in turn referred to what Dr Cheong had said in a lecture she delivered on 10 April 2018 in the IPS-Nathan Lecture Series (“the IPS Lecture”). That letter alleged that Dr Cheong had said that Singapore’s population density would increase from 11,000 people per sq km to 13,700 people per sq km in 2030 (“Dr Cheong’s Statement”). It queried whether this meant that as Singapore’s land area was a mere 720 sq km, its population could go up to nearly 10 million by 2030.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 Parties had referred to a written script of the IPS Lecture. The relevant portion states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">3) Deliver Well Managed and Liveable Density</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center">With a growing population, living density in Singapore will increase from 11,000 persons per square kilometre to 13,700 persons per square kilometre between now and 2030. However we need not fear densification if it is done well. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 Following the publication of the SDP Article, the Alternate Authority for the Minister issued a CD on 4 July 2020 (“the 4 July CD”) identifying the Subject Statement and requiring SDP to publish a notice which referred readers to a government website laying out the correct facts. The 4 July CD clarified that Dr Cheong had referred to living density and not population density. Living density takes into account only the land available for urban areas, and excludes land used for ports, airports and defence, among others. It was therefore inaccurate and misleading to extrapolate a population size of 10 million by 2030 by applying the living density figure to the total area of Singapore. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 Accordingly, SDP sought to set aside the 4 July CD under s 17(1) POFMA, asserting that the Subject Statement was a statement of opinion; in the alternative, that the Subject Statement was a true statement of fact. SDP had also sought for the hearing to proceed in open court under Rule 11 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulations) Rules 2019 (“POFMA Rules”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary issue</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 A preliminary issue was whether the hearing should proceed in open court. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 There were no special reasons that the starting position in O 28 r 2 of the Rules of Court should be departed from (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that all originating summonses shall be heard in chambers unless the court directed otherwise). The fact that an issue was of public interest or raised a constitutional point alone did not constitute a special reason to have an open court hearing: [<span class="font-weight-bold">26</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">27</span>].  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The approach to s 17 POFMA applications</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The approach to s 17 POFMA applications is set out in <span class="font-italic">The Online Citizen Pte Ltd v AG </span>[2021] 2 SLR 1358 where the Court of Appeal laid out a five-step analytical framework applicable to setting-aside applications under s 17 of the POFMA (“the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework”). The first step of the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> Framework was to determine the meaning of the subject statement in question and the second step was to interpret the material targeted by a CD to determine whether it contained the subject statement. The third and fourth steps were to determine if the subject statement was a statement of fact and, if so, whether it was false. The fifth step was to determine if the subject statement had been communicated in Singapore and had been accessed in Singapore. SDP’s argument that the court should determine what Dr Cheong’s Statement meant rather than what the Subject Statement meant was incorrect: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">42</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">47</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 There was no dispute as to what the Subject Statement meant. It meant that  Dr Cheong had said that the population density over the entire land area of Singapore would increase from 11,000 people per sq km to 13,700 people per sq km between the time of Dr Cheong’s Statement to 2030. Given Singapore’s land area, Singapore’s population would increase to nearly 10 million by 2030: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">46</span>]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 It was also clear that the SDP Article contained the Subject Statement: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">4</span><span class="font-weight-bold">8</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 SDP argued that the first sentence of the Subject Statement had clearly stated what Dr Cheong had said. The terms “living density” and “population density” were virtually synonymous. Next, the second sentence in the Subject Statement was SDP’s interpretation of Dr Cheong’s Statement. It was a deductive process which rendered the Subject Statement an opinion rather than fact. The court rejected this argument as the SDP Article had opened with the following line: The idea of Singapore increasing its population to 10 million did not originate from the SDP. The entire Subject Statement purported to be a report of what Dr Cheong had said in the IPS Lecture. Hence, both sentences were statements of fact: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">56</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">60</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13  The court was of the view that the Subject Statement was false. First, it was telling that SDP chose to steer away from a letter by HDB’s Director (Strategic Planning) Jaffrey Aw published in the Straits Times on 24 April 2018 (“Mr Aw’s Letter”). Mr Aw’s Letter was made in response to Mr Cheang’s Forum Letter and essentially clarified the difference between the concepts of population and living density and that living density takes into account only the land available for urban areas and excludes land used for ports, airports, defence and utilities, among others. That letter also said that it would be inaccurate to extrapolate the population size from the living density figures. SDP had themselves referred to the Mr Aw’s Letter in its application to cancel the 4 July CD, and for this reason (among others), it was not open to SDP’s counsel to suggest that SDP might not have been aware of Mr Aw’s Letter: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">56</span>], [<span class="font-weight-bold">67</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">79</span>]. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Second, if one were to apply the initial density in Dr Cheong’s Statement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> 11,000 people per sq km to Singapore’s total land area of about 720 sq km, this would yield a figure of 7,920,000 persons at the time of the IPS Lecture in 2018. Singapore’s population at the time was not even 6.9 million. SDP must have known that the density in Dr Cheong’s Statement could not be simply applied over Singapore’s total land area: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">83</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 Lastly, it was not disputed that the Subject Statement had been communicated in Singapore and had been accessed in Singapore: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">92</span>] </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed. SDP had deliberately included the Subject Statement in the SDP Article despite knowing it was false.
