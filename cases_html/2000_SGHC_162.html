<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1 The applicant, Linda Lai Swee Lin

(‘Linda’) an aggrieved former Government employee applied to court under O 53 of

the Rules of Court for leave to make an application for four separate judicial review

orders. These were:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

  decision which was conveyed to her on 19 August 1998 extending her probationary period as

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">iii a writ of certiorari to quash the

  decision of Public Services Commission (PSC) which was conveyed to her on 21 July 1999

  refusing her appeal against the above decision; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">iv an Order of mandamus reinstating her as

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 The facts of the case as gathered from

the statement filed by the applicant can be summarised as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 The applicant, an Asean scholar who

graduated with a law degree from the University of Malaya in 1979 and a post-graduate

Master of Laws from the National University of Singapore in 1993, applied for a position

of Senior Officer with the Ministry of Law on 28 August 1996 and was offered this post.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 The applicant’s letter of

appointment contained many terms and conditions including one which declared that her

tenure of office was ‘permanent’ and her appointment was that of ‘Senior

Officer Grade III (Law) w.e.f. the date of assumption of duty’. It also stated that

the "Period of Probation [was] 1 yr w.e.f. the date of assumption of duty".

Amongst the other terms and conditions stipulated, the following two conditions require

reproduction:</font></p>

    writing. If the Permanent Secretary has doubts about the suitability of the officer, or

    feels that the officer’s progress has not been of a high enough standard for him to

    be confirmed, the Permanent Secretary has to consider:</font></p>

    if he is not the Appointing Authority, has to refer the case to the Appointing Authority

    at least 2 months before the end of the officer’s probationary or trial period. The

    Appointing Authority will then submit the case to the Public Service Commission together

    with a recommendation to terminate the officer’s service, or revert him (put him

    back) to his previous grade, as the case may be.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 Appendix B5 of the IM specified that the

effective date of confirmation would be the date immediately following the date on which

the normal period of probation would end.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The applicant’s probation</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 The applicant commenced her appointment

on 28 November 1996 and in the normal course would have completed her probation on 27

November 1997. She was, when she first started her appointment, designated Head (Legal)

reporting to the Deputy Commissioner of Land, Mr Liew Choon Boon ("DCOL"). On or

about 30 June 1997, about 7 months after she commenced her probation, she was requested by

the DCOL to take on added responsibilities. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 In the course of her duties, the

applicant oversaw the operations of the Lease Administration Section in carrying out title

management work, in particular, lifting of title restriction, upgrading of lease tenure

and enforcement of the covenants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 Under the IM, a confidential staff

report was required every six months during the probationary period of all public servants

The applicant was given such a staff confidential report form to be completed and passed

on to her immediate superior (DCOL) for the two six-month period during her probation. IM

No. 2 B.42 provided that if an officer were to receive an adverse report within the first

six months, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry should verbally inform the officer of

his or her shortcomings. If these shortcomings were to persist in the next six months, the

officer was to be informed in writing.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 The applicant never received, at any

time during her probationary period, any adverse report nor was she informed verbally or

in writing of any shortcomings or that she was not performing up to expectation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 At the end of the applicant’s

probationary period, sometime in November/December 1997, she asked her immediate superior,

DCOL about her appraisal. He replied that he had requested DA2 (Mr Leong Foke Meng) to

appraise her and that the latter had given her a ‘generous’ appraisal. She

therefore expected her confirmation to be no more than a mere formality.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 She highlighted the aspect that if the

Permanent Secretary had indeed decided to extend her probation or not to confirm her, the

IM obliged the Permanent Secretary to inform her of his decision in sufficient time before

her probationary period ended (IM B66). She received no indication at any time during her

probationary period that the Permanent Secretary had decided not to confirm her or to

extend her probation. She added that according to Appendix B-5 of the IM, she was,

consequently, entitled to be treated as confirmed as of the date immediately following the

date of her normal period of probation. As the events unfolded, in or around December

1997, the applicant enquired from the then Commissioner of Lands (COL) regarding her

letter of confirmation. She then received a reply with the words to the effect that there

was no hurry and that when the letter was issued, the arrears of increment would be paid.

Hence, she did not pursue the matter further and expected the confirmation letter in due

course. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 In or about March 1998, Director

Alienation 1 ("DA1"), Mr Gaw Seng Suan, who had previously left for the private

sector, rejoined the Civil Service. He was re-appointed to the same position.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 A meeting was called on 29 May 1998,

attended by DCOL as Chairman, DA1, DA2 as well as the other section heads including the

applicant. The said meeting was called because the then President, Mr Ong Teng Cheong, had

queried on the inefficiency of the Land Office with respect to land titles which had been

forwarded to him for approval after years of delay. It was discovered that 128 titles had

been delayed, some for between 10 and 20 years.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 Following the meeting, having knowledge

that DA1 and DA2 had not accurately reflected the extent of the backlog, the applicant

sent an electronic mail dated 30 May 1998 to DCOL who was her immediate superior. The

letter was copied to the then COL (Mr Low Oon Song). The said electronic mail read as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I refer to the meeting yesterday.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I was surprised that both DA1 and DA2 did

  not inform you that there are many more outstanding cases not in CTS, the ‘real’

  backlog cases.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I come from Malaysia where there is much

  inefficiency and corruption. I could not accept such a situation, hence I readily accepted

  Singapore citizenship.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, I find that there are

  delays and backlog in Alienation Division. I believe I have a duty to bring them up, so

  that you are aware of the seriousness of the problem and not be kept in the dark.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Lucy (one of the Section Heads) mentioned

  that there are some cases that "she will clear in her own time." during the

  meeting. May I suggest that you e mail to DA1 and DA2 to give you a list of all

  outstanding cases not in CTS.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Only then you would realise the extent of

  the delays/backlog. A deadline can then be fixed to clear all such backlog. If not, they

  will merely accumulate and increase over the years eg the file I routed to you (DP paid 4

  years ago &amp; Supplemental Deed not even executed).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I bring this up in good faith, for the

  good of the Land Office in the long run. Also in the spirit of PS 21, &amp; not to find

  fault with others.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">As a responsible Singaporean, I cannot

  just keep quiet &amp; be unconcerned, when I know that delays and backlog are not being

  resolved for years. In my opinion, Directors should ensure that their Divisions run

  efficiently, thank you.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 The applicant had, even at the time of

sending that electronic mail, ie after 1 years in service, never received any adverse

report nor was she informed of any shortcomings on her part, whether orally or in writing.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 On 1 June 1998, the day following the

transmission of the electronic mail, the applicant was verbally informed by the then COL

that he would not confirm her as there was conflict and friction between herself and DA1.

This was the first time that she had heard of this and she was therefore surprised and

upset. The announcement not to confirm her had come out of the blue. Her explanation to

the COL that the friction was due to the conflict of hierarchy was apparently not

well-received.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Retrospective extension of probation</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 On or about 24 August 1998, about 9

months after her probationary period had ended, the applicant received a letter dated 19

August 1998 through DCOL, DA2, and DA1 which stated that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. … Based on the recommendation from

  the appraisal reports in respect of your service from 28 Nov 96 till 27 Nov 97, we regret

  to inform your that you are unable to be confirmed in your appointment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. However, approval has been granted for

  the extension of your probationary period for 1 year with effect from 28 November 1997 to

  27 November 1998. …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. As adverse reports have been received

  in respect of your service from 28 Nov 96 to 27 Nov 97, we are to inform you of your

  shortcomings. This is in order for your to make improvements necessary for your

  confirmation in service, failing which termination of your service may be considered.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 This was the first time the applicant

had heard of ‘adverse reports’. In fact, no adverse reports of any nature had

been received or heard of by her between the period 28 November 1996 and 27 November 1997,

as alleged.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 The applicant was taken aback. Nearly

nine months after her purported confirmation date, she was told that she would be placed

on probation for another year, to be backdated to 27 November 1997, the date her initial

probationary period should have ended. Her plaint was that if she had been

underperforming, the IM obliged the Permanent Secretary to inform her of any adverse

appraisal early during her probationary period, which the Permanent Secretary did not, to

enable her to know what her perceived shortcomings were, and to take steps to improve. The

IM also obliged the Permanent Secretary to inform the applicant well before the end of her

probationary period if a decision was made not to confirm her or to extend her

probationary period. This however, was not done. At any rate, the purported extension of

her probationary period for one year was a myth. In reality it was only for three months

since nine months had already elapsed by the time she was notified of the extension of the

probationary period with retrospective effect.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21 By a letter dated 1 September 1998, the

applicant sent a protest to the new COL informing him amongst other things that:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22 Following that letter, the situation

between the applicant and DA1 who was by now her immediate superior, became intolerable.

As such, on 1 September 1998, the applicant sent a further electronic mail to the COL.

Twelve days after her mail dated 1 September 1998, she received still no answer. During

those twelve days, she requested to see the COL many times only to be informed each time

that he was busy. On or about 12 September 1998, the applicant sent another electronic

mail to the COL stating that if he did not wish to decide on the matter, she would have no

choice but to refer the matter to the Ministry of Law.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23 The applicant received an immediate

reply to her electronic mail with words to the effect: ‘Never threaten me. It amounts

to insubordination.’ The mail further stated that her work was unsatisfactory. The

applicant never intended to be insubordinate but was unfortunately perceived as such. The

COL made it known in the said mail that he was not the appointing authority.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24 After making representations to a

number of persons in the Ministry, the applicant decided to highlight her grievances

through the proper channel and consequently wrote a letter dated 30 September 1998 to the

Permanent Secretary (Law) through the COL.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The applicant’s appeals</font></p>
</b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25 The applicant appealed against her

termination first to the Minister for Law by her letters dated 20 December 1998 and 26

December 1998. In those letters, she complained that there was a breach of natural justice

procedures and that her superiors had not paid heed to the IM in their dealings with her.

She then received a reply from the Deputy Secretary dated 29 December 1998 informing her

that since the decision to terminate her service was made by the Senior Personnel Board F,

she should appeal to the Appeals Board. She promptly appealed to the Minister for Law by a

letter dated 31 December 1999 stating that her non-confirmation was wrongful and improper

and that it was the wrongful non-confirmation that led to the unlawful termination.

However, the Ministry replied by a letter dated 15 January 1999 that even for

confirmation, the appropriate authority for appeal was the Appeals Board.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26 The applicant commenced the formal

appeal process by a letter dated 23 January 1999 to the Appeals Board, Public Service

Division. She referred to the Appeals Board all the letters that she had written

previously on this matter. There were several grounds advanced by her, chief amongst them

were that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1) procedures in the IM were not complied

  with and there was mala fide (on the part of her superiors); and that</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2) she was not informed of any

  shortcomings with respect to her work during her probationary period.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27 The other grounds of appeal put forward

by her against her termination included the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1) that she was not informed that her

  matter would be brought before the Senior Personnel Board F, nor of the date of the

  inquiry; and that</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2) she was not informed of the case made

  against her nor given an opportunity to be heard before the Senior Personnel Board F.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28 By a letter dated 29 January 1999, the

applicant wrote to the Appeals Board indicating that she would be willing to serve in

another Ministry. She further wrote to the Appeals Board on 6 February 1999 and 16

February 1999 providing them with further particulars. She later received a reply from the

Appeals Board by a letter dated 22 March 1999 informing her that her appeal was

unsuccessful.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29 By a letter dated 3 April 1999, the

applicant wrote to the Appeals Board requesting another chance. On 7 April 1999, the

Appeals Board informed the applicant that she should direct all further appeals to the

Public Service Commission (PSC). In the result, she by her letter dated 22 May 1999

appealed to the PSC but was informed on 25 May 1999 that she was out of time for the

appeal. She wrote to the PSC on 28 May 1999 requesting a waiver on grounds that her

earlier letter had been misdirected by the postal services. This was granted by a letter

dated 3 June 1999. Thereafter, the applicant submitted her further appeals to the PSC by

way of her letter dated 10 June 1999. On 21 July 1999, she was advised by the PSC that her

appeal was again unsuccessful.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The present application</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30 The applicant’s many grievances

and the grounds in relation to the application before me were spelt out in detail in the

submissions by her counsel, Mr Harpreet Singh. The relevant segments of his submissions

were as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31 The applicant was aggrieved that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) almost nine months after her probation

  had ended she was informed that she would not be confirmed despite the fact she had

  received no adverse comment, oral or written, about her performance during her probation

  period;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) her probation was extended

  retrospectively nine months after the date of confirmation. The letter extending her

  probation merely stated in general terms that she had been informed that her work

  performance was not up to the standard required. No specific allegations were made to

  which the applicant could answer;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) In August 1998, she was told that she

  had her probation period extended by one year although in effect she had only three months

  to improve her work performance failing which her services would be terminated. No

  particulars were given as to what she was required to do to improve her work performance;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Even at the start of the purported

  extension of her probationary period, the applicant’s new appraising officer (DA1)

  informed her that she would not be confirmed and that she should look for another job;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) All the plaintiff’s pleas for a

  transfer so that her work could be objectively assessed fell on deaf ears.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32 Mr Singh further submitted that the

refusal to confirm the plaintiff after her initial one-year probationary period was

wrongful, improper and/or irrational. He contended that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) the applicant was never informed

  during her probationary period that there were adverse reports against her, contrary to

  the provisions contained in paragraph B20 of the IM;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) it would be irrational to justify the

  applicant’s non-confirmation as she had not received any adverse reports. All her

  recommendations/submissions in the course of work had been accepted and approved by the

  then COL. Seven months into her probation, she was given added responsibilities to cover

  two other positions in addition to her substantive appointment. In addition, she had been

  earlier advised that her appraisal was ‘generous’;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) the applicant’s letter of

  appointment had represented that discretion as to confirmation would be exercised in

  accordance with the instructions, however styled, that are in force. As such, the

  applicant acted on that representation believing that if she had not received any adverse

  reports from her superiors, she would be confirmed from the date after her probation

  ended;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) paragraph 42 of the IM required the

  Permanent Secretary ‘to make sure that staff confidential reports were put up every

  six months on all probationary officers in Divisions 1, II and III.’ After the

  applicant’s probationary period ended on 27 November 1997, the applicant was not

  given any report form to be filled up within the 6 months following. This was consistent

  with the fact that the applicant was no longer treated as a probationary officer;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) the applicant was informed of the

  extension of her probation, nine months after her confirmation date, contrary to paragraph

  B 66 of the IM; and that</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(f) the grounds given for the extension of

  the applicant’s probation were invalid, vague, irrelevant, and unjustified, in the

  light of the applicant’s work performance and conduct during her probationary period

  and thereafter.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33 Mr Singh further submitted that the

eventual termination of the applicant’s service was <i>ultra vires</i>, wrongful and

improper in that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) it stemmed from a wrongful decision to

  extend the applicant’s probationary period;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) the applicant’s probation had

  long been over, she was for all intents and purposes a confirmed officer. Therefore,

  pursuant to Article 110D(2) of the Constitution, Senior Personnel Board F had no

  jurisdiction to terminate the applicant’s appointment. It was only the Public Service

  Commission which had the requisite jurisdiction, if at all;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) there was a breach of the rules of

  natural justice as the applicant was not given an opportunity to be heard in respect of

  the allegations made against her at Senior Personnel Board F, the Appeals Board and Public

  Service Commission proceedings. The applicant was not told of what factors were considered

  and therefore had no opportunity to meet the allegations made against her; and that</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) there was also <i>mala fide</i> as

  evidenced by the applicant’s letters to Permanent Secretary (Law).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34 The present application was duly served

on the Attorney-General as was required under the Rules of Court. It was, as it turned

out, opposed vigorously on several grounds by Senior State Counsel, Mr Jeffrey Chan, who

was given the courtesy of addressing the court on this <i>exparte</i> application. The

main points of his objections were: (a) that there was no element of public law in the

determination of the applicant’s employment and consequently, judicial review being a

public law remedy, was not available to the applicant; and (b) that in any event, the

applicant was out of time for applying for judicial review in respect of the extension of

her probationary period, which decision was conveyed to her on 19 August 1998 and the

decision of the Senior Personnel Board F terminating her employment which was conveyed to

her on 17 December 1998.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Arguments by the senior state counsel</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35 On the first ground that public law

remedies were not available to the applicant, Mr Chan’s contentions as encapsulated

by him in one of the synopses submitted, read as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Judicial review is a remedy that lies

  exclusively in public law. This remedy is not available to the plaintiff [applicant]

  unless she shows that a public law right that she enjoyed has been infringed. As was said

  by the Court of Appeal in <i>Regina v. East Berkshire Health Authority, Ex parte Walsh</i>

  [1984] 3 All ER 425 (DB-6), "employment by a public authority does not per se inject

  any element of public law".</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) The Plaintiff [applicant] was

  employed as a probationer and her employment was governed by contract. The fact that she

  was not confirmed does not give rise to any public law right. An employee on probation is

  generally eligible for confirmation subject to the employer being satisfied with the

  employee’s work and conduct. Confirmation is not an entitlement or a right. As was

  pointed out by the Privy Council in <i>Munusamy v Public Services Commission</i> <nobr>[1967] 1 MLJ 199</nobr> at 202: </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">" ‘Eligible for is not

  equivalent to ‘entitled to’ and means no more than ‘fit to be chosen

  for’."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) There was also no element of public

  law in the termination of her employment. The Plaintiff [applicant] was not dismissed from

  service. The statutory provisions on dismissal of civil servants did not apply to her and

  are not relevant in this case. The termination of the Plaintiff’s [applicant’s]

  service was pursuant to the contractual terms governing her employment. The source of the

  power exercised by the Defendants in terminating the Plaintiff’s [applicant’s]

  employment was contractual and her remedies against any wrongful termination therefore lie

  only in private law.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) The case of <i>Regina v. Crown

  Prosecution Service, Ex parte Hogg</i> The Times 14 April 1994 is on point. The facts of

  the case are as follows. Mr Hogg was appointed as a prosecutor in the Crown Prosecution

  Service. During his probationary service, he was dismissed. As in the present case, Mr

  Hogg challenged the dismissal and alleged non-compliance with procedures governing

  dismissal. He applied for leave to apply for judicial review but leave was not granted on

  the ground that the dismissal was not a public law issue. This decision was upheld by the

  Court of Appeal. The Court held that the relationship between the Crown as an employer and

  the Crown servant as employee was a private law relationship and not one which brought in

  public law principles.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(v) This principle has been repeatedly

  upheld in a number of other cases such as <i>R v Lord Chancellor’s Department, Ex

  parte Nangle</i> [1992] 1 All ER 897 (DB-5), <i>R v. East Berkshire Health Authority, Ex

  parte Walsh</i> [1984] 3 All ER 425 (DB-6) and <i>Gnanasundram v. Public Service

  Commission</i> <nobr>[1966] MLJ 157</nobr> (DB-7). These cases have been discussed in the

  Attorney-General’s earlier submissions. The Plaintiff’s solicitors, both in

  their written and oral submissions, did not distinguish or rebutt the principles embodied

  in these cases.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(vi) The only case submitted by the

  Plaintiff [applicant] on this point, namely <i>Dr Chandra Muzaffar v. Universiti Malaya</i>
<nobr>[2000] 1 MLJ 173</nobr> is without merit. In that case, the Applicant was appointed as a

  professor by the Respondent. Subsequently, the Applicant’s contract was terminated

  and the Applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review. The Court decided that

  "it was not improper" for the Applicant to apply for judicial review as the

  Respondent was a creature of statute and the Applicant was its employee. The Court only

  referred in passing to two Malaysian cases and made no reference to the body of cases that

  have developed on this issue. The judgment is without legal reasoning and should be

  disregarded.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36 Mr Chan also contended that the

applicant’s employment was terminated in accordance with the provisions that

empowered her managers to terminate her employment. Her case was therefore purely one of a

contract being terminated in accordance with applicable provisions. Termination of service

was not dismissal and the provisions relating to dismissals, therefore, were not

applicable. He went on to argue that the applicant held office ‘at the pleasure of

the President’ and the services of persons who held such an office could be

terminated any time subject to constitutionally prescribed procedures. He maintained that

there was no breach of natural justice in the case at hand.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37 Mr Chan further contended that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) the applicant had dwelt at length on

  what she said were the reasons for the termination of her services. In gist, she was

  alleging that her services were terminated because she had exposed the incompetence of her

  seniors. Her seniors and the Ministry of Law had a completely different version of the

  facts relied on by her. They would, at the appropriate time and should it be necessary to

  do so, present these to the court. However, the reasons for the applicant’s

  termination were, in the main, irrelevant to the present proceedings. A writ of certiorari

  can only lay to quash a decision tainted by illegality, irrationality or procedural

  impropriety (see: <i>Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service</i>

  [1985] AC 374). It can also be used to quash an unreasonable decision but the level of

  unreasonableness must be very high. It must satisfy the <i>Wednesbury</i> Test. (see <i>Associated

  Provincial Picture House Ltd v Wednesbury Corp</i> [1947] 2 All ER 685);</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) A writ of certiorari ought not to be

  granted to quash a wrong decision unless the decision offended these principles;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) On the face of it, the decisions which

  the applicant was seeking to quash did not offend any of these principles. In fact,

  nowhere did the applicant adduce evidence which would prove that the decisions she was

  seeking to impugn offended these principles. The facts which she relied on to show that

  the decisions were ‘ultra vires, improper and/or irrational’ did not illustrate

  these points;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(4) The court should not substitute its

  judgment whether the applicant should or should not be confirmed for the judgments of

  those who had worked with her and supervised her work on a day- to-day basis. The issue

  before the court was whether the authorities who were responsible for confirming her or

  for terminating her services acted in accordance with what were required by law to be

  done. Given the applicant’s status as an unconfirmed officer, this was fully complied

  with by the relevant authorities.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(5) Inherent in all that the applicant was

  alleging was that the decision not to confirm her in her appointment and to terminate her

  services was motivated by mala fide. Mala fide would require a very high degree of proof.

  Just because she believed that the decisions were motivated by mala fide, did not mean

  that those decisions were, motivated by mala fide in law. In the absence of supporting

  evidence of mala fide, the court should not reach such a conclusion merely because she

  believed that the decisions were such and had said so.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Reply by the applicant’s counsel</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38 Mr Singh’s detailed reply to the

concerns addressed by Senior State Counsel had a persuasive ring to it – not to

mention the force of logic and well structured propositions of law. Presently, he invited

my attention to a test enunciated by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <i><b>Chan Hiang

Leng Colin v Minister for Information and the Arts</b></i> <nobr>[1996] 1 SLR 609</nobr> (CA) at 616

where it was stated by Karthigesu JA:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… the court should quickly peruse the

  material put before it and consider whether such material discloses what might on further

  consideration turn out to be an arguable case. The other is that the applicant had to make

  out a ‘prima facie case of reasonable suspicion’. In our view, both tests

  present a very low threshold and it is questionable whether there is really any difference

  in substance between the two interpretations.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">What is required is not a prima facie

  case, but a prima facie case of reasonable suspicion. If the latter can be shown then it

  cannot necessarily be said that the application must necessarily fail, for there would

  then appear to be an ‘arguable case’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Decision</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39 Much emphasis was laid by Mr Chan that

judicial review was a remedy that lay exclusively in public law and that this remedy was

not available to the plaintiff unless she showed that a public law right that she enjoyed

had been infringed. In this regard, reference was made to <i><b>R v East Berkshire Health

Authority ex parte Walsh</b></i> [1984] 3 All ER 425 (CA). The facts of this case as apear

in the headnotes of the case are set out below.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40 The applicant was employed as a senior

nursing officer by the respondent health authority under a contract of employment which,

pursuant to the National Health Service (Remuneration and Conditions of Service)

Regulations 1974, incorporated terms and conditions which were negotiated by a recognised

negotiating body and approved by the Secretary of State for Social Services. In August

1982 the district nursing officer suspended the applicant from duty and on 27 September

she purported to terminate his employment with the health authority. The applicant sought

judicial review of the dismissal, on the grounds that the district nursing officer had

acted ultra-vires in dismissing him and that there had been breaches of the rules of

natural justice in the procedures leading up to the dismissal. The health authority raised

the preliminary point whether it was appropriate for the applicant to question the

dismissal by bringing proceedings for judicial review. The judge held that the

applicant’s rights were of a sufficiently public nature to entitle him to seek public

law remedies or, alternatively, that if he was not entitled to an order of certiorari he

could, under Ord 53, r 9(5) of the RSC, continue the action as though it had been begun by

writ.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41 The health authority appealed and in

allowing the appeal the Court of Appeal held, amongst other things that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Whether a dismissal from employment by a

  public authority was subject to public law remedies depended on whether there were special

  statutory restrictions on dismissal which underpinned the employee’s position, and

  not on the fact of employment by a public authority per se …</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42 Donaldson MR observed in his judgment

at page 429:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The remedy of judicial review is only

  available where an issue of ‘public law’ is involved, but, as Lord Wilberforce

  pointed out in <i>Davy v Spelthorne BC</i> [1983] 3 All ER 278 at 285, [1984] AC 262 at

  276, the expressions ‘public law’ and ‘private law’ are recent

  immigrants and, while convenient for descriptive purposes, must be used with caution,

  since English law traditionally fastens not so much on principles as on remedies. On the

  other hand, to concentrate on remedies would in the present context involve a degree of

  circularity or levitation by traction applied to shoestrings, since the remedy of

  ‘certiorari’ might well be available if the health authority is in breach of a

  ‘public law’ obligation, but would not be if it is only in breach of a

  ‘private law’ obligation.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43 The next case relied on by Mr Chan was

a Malaysian decision: <i><b>Gnanasundram v Public Services Commission</b></i> (1966) 1 MLJ 157. In <i><b>Gnanasundram</b></i>, the applicant filed for an order of certiorari to

quash the decision of the Public Services Commission terminating the appointment of the

applicant, a temporary officer. The application was made more than six months after the

decision of the Public Services Commission and the applicant applied for enlargement of

time to make the application. Raja Azlan Shah J (as he then was) in dismissing the

application held that the relationship between the government and the applicant was one of

contract and the government was therefore entitled to terminate the employment of the

applicant by payment of a month’s salary in lieu of notice as provided in the

contract. In respect of the enlargement of time issue, the learned judge said in passing

that the court would only extend the time where a strong case for it is shown and the only

delay involved in the pursuit of a legal remedy open to the applicant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44 The principles articulated by Donaldson

MR in <i><b>exparte Walsh</b></i> (<i>supra</i>) cannot be second-guessed. However, the

submission by Mr Chan that the applicant’s grievance fell indubitably beyond the pale

of public law right sounded a little exotic, particularly when the duty of the court

hearing an exparte application, such as the one at hand, was not to embark upon any

detailed and microscopic analysis of the material placed before it but as enjoined by the

Singapore Court of Appeal in <i><b>Chan Hiang Leng Colin</b></i> to peruse the material

before it quickly and appraise whether such material disclosed an arguable and a <i>prima

facie</i> case of reasonable suspicion. In my view, the applicant had more than

comfortably crossed the threshold barriers and had placed adequate material before the

court for it to conclude that there was indeed a <i>prima facie</i> case of reasonable

suspicion. In my view, the Malaysian decision of <i><b>Gnanasundram</b></i> was not of any

assistance to the respondent since that case was in relation to the termination of

employment of a temporary employee and there was no question of any reported flouting of

any of the provisions of the IM or its equivalent.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45 Additionally, in <i><b>R v Chief

Constable of Greater Manchester Police, ex parte Lainton</b></i> The Times 13 July 1998

Jackson J dealing with a somewhat similar case deemed fit to observe (see heading Part 5:

The Timing issue): ‘Indeed in the ordinary case, a decision taken after expiry of the

two year period to relegate a police constable to the status of probationer may well be

vulnerable to attack on grounds such as unreasonableness.’ In this regard, I agree

with Mr Singh’s submission that the decision not to confirm the applicant, many

months of service after the end of her regular probationary period could be vitiated by

the <i><b>Wednesbury</b></i> unreasonableness.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46 In my provisional view, the

circumstances under which the applicant’s probation came to be extended and the

subsequent decisions by the Senior Personnel Board F as well as the PSC, seemed to fall in

the sphere of public law rights. The fact she was told that her probation had been

extended for one year after the lapse of nine months since her probationary period and

that too without any previous adverse reports, patently straddled the area of <i><b>Wednesbury</b></i>

unreasonableness. Again, in my provisional view, the apparent disregard of the provisions

of the Instruction Manual by the applicant’s superiors was a concern more of public

law and not private law. Such disregard also appeared to lend weight to the

applicant’s allegations of unfairness, improper dealings and bad faith.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47 In <i><b>Dr Chandra Muzaffar v

Universiti Malaya</b></i> <nobr>[2000] 1 MLJ 173</nobr>, the Malaysian High Court had to deal with an

application similar to the one at hand. In that case, the applicant was appointed on a

yearly basis by the respondent as the director and professor of civilisation and dialogue

centre of the respondent university with effect from 1 March 1997. After having the

applicant’s contract renewed for the second year, the respondent issued a letter to

the applicant dated 18 February 1999 indicating that on the expiry of the second year, the

contract would no longer be renewed. The applicant’s contract was terminated on 28

February 1999. The applicant applied for leave to apply for an order of certiorari to

quash the decision of the respondent and mandamus to direct the respondent to make a

decision in accordance with law by reinstating the applicant. The issues were: (i) whether

it was proper for the court to entertain an application under O 53 of the Rules of the

High Court 1980 as the applicant’s complaint was on refusal to renew the contract

rather than a dismissal; (ii) whether it would be premature to discuss issues of merit at

this leave application stage; and (iii) whether the respondent in the leave application

stage had the right to lodge an appeal against the decision, as the applicant’s

application for leave was made ex parte.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48 In granting leave to the applicant to

apply for the order of certiorari and mandamus, Azmel J held:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) The respondent is a creature of a

  statute and the applicant was an employee of the respondent at the time of the incident.

  The decision that had been made by the respondent had direct effect on the employment of

  the applicant. It is not improper for the applicant to commence an action in this court

  under O 53 of the Rules of the High Court 1980 (see p 176F-G).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) It would be premature to discuss issue

  of merits at this leave application stage. The respondent would not in any way be

  prejudiced as such arguments on merits can be appropriately done at the later stage (see p

  178A); <i>Dr Amir Hussein v Universiti Sains Malaysia</i> <nobr>[1989] 3 MLJ 298</nobr> distinguished.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) The respondent at this leave

  application stage does not have the right to lodge an appeal against the decision for

  leave because the respondent is not made a party to the application yet. Only the

  applicant was a party to this ex-parte application and only the applicant has the legal

  capacity to lodge an appeal if he is not satisfied with the decision. The appeal by the

  respondent should be summarily struck off for want of locus (see p 177A-B).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49 I adopt the views expressed by Azmel J.

Although Mr Chan urged the court not to follow the decision of Azmel J, in my opinion the

Malaysian decision did not in any way fall foul of either the test set out in <i><b>Chan

Hiang Leng Colin</b></i> (<i>supra</i>) by the Singapore Court of Appeal or what Donaldson

MR observed in <i><b>ex parte Walsh</b></i> (<i>supra</i>). It should be presently

remarked that the facts in <i><b>ex parte Walsh</b></i> (<i>supra</i>) did not bear any

resemblance to the facts and averments in the case at hand. In my provisional opinion, the

complaint of the applicant that there was breach of the rules of natural justice as she

was not given an opportunity to be heard in respect of the allegations levelled against

her at the Senior Personnel Board F and later, clearly fell to be determined in a judicial

review proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50 The next point argued by Mr Chan was

that the applicant was out of time in making the current application and that the court

should not enlarge the time. It is a settled principle of law that in judicial review

cases the applicant should in the first instance exhaust all available statutory internal

remedies before he or she had recourse to judicial review. In this connection, it would be

instructive to refer first to the case of <i><b>R v Epping &amp; Harlow General

Commissioners</b></i> [1983] 3 All ER 257 where it was held that where a statute had

provided a remedy before another tribunal, the aggrieved person should exhaust his

remedies before he can come to court. It had also been stated in <i><b>Reg v Chief

Constable ex parte Merrill</b></i> [1989] 1 WLR 1077 at 1088, that normally the time for

judicial review would not arise if at all before the appeal tribunal has given its

decision.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51 The chronology of events which was not

disputed in this matter appeared to be as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">24 August 1998 - Nearly nine months after

  her probation had ended, the applicant was told that her probation had been extended.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">17 December 1998 - Applicant was informed

  that her services had been terminated by the Senior Personnel Board.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">23 January 1999 - The applicant commenced

  the formal appeals process by way of a letter to the Appeal Board, Public Service

  Division.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">23 March 1999 - Appeals Board informed the

  applicant that it had agreed with the decision of the Senior Personnel Board.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10 June 1999 - Applicant appealed to the

  Public Service Commission.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">21 July 1999 - Applicant was advised by

  letter that she was unsuccessful.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">20 January 2000 - Applicant files

  Originating Summons No 96 of 2000 for leave under O 53 of the Rules of Court.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52 Perusal of the chronology supported the

conclusion that the applicant was well within the time frame prescribed ie, six months

under O 53 Rule 1(6) of the Rules of Court which provides that leave shall not be granted

to apply for an order of certiorari unless the application is made within six months after

the date of proceedings, except where the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction of

the judge to whom the application for leave is made.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53 Even if there was a delay, I was amply

satisfied that the delay had not been due to any fancy footwork by the applicant; rather

it was wholly owing to the steps taken by her to exhaust all available internal remedies

as explained to the court by counsel. As observed by Raja Azlan Shah in <i><b>Gnanasundram</b></i>

(<i>supra</i>) the court would extend the time where the delay was as a result of the

pursuit by the applicant of a legal remedy (page 159 of the report, <i>supra</i>). In the

circumstances, I found the contention by Mr Chan that the applicant was out of time as

devoid of merit. At any rate, if need be, there were compelling grounds justifying the

grant of an extension which I would have readily given for reasons given by the

applicant’s counsel.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54 Having been satisfied that the material

placed before me appeared to disclose ‘a prima facie case of reasonable

suspicion’ as laid down in <i><b>Chan Hiang Leng Colin</b></i> and that the

grievances raised appeared to fall well within the boundaries of public law, I granted the

application and made the following orders:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) a writ of certiorari to quash the

  decision of the Commissioner of Lands and/or the Permanent Secretary (Ministry of Law)

  and/or such other Appointing Authority (as defined in the Government Instruction Manual)

  conveyed to the respondent by a letter dated 19 August 1998 extending the

  respondent’s probationary period as a Senior Officer Grade III (Law) for one year

  retrospectively with effect from 28 November 1997 to 27 November 1998;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) a writ of certiorari to quash the

  decision of Senior Personnel Board F conveyed to the respondent by a letter dated 17

  December 1998 terminating the respondent’s services as Senior Officer Grade III with

  effect from 21 December 1998; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) a writ of certiorari to quash the

  decision of the Public Service Commission conveyed to the respondent by a letter dated 21

  July 1999 refusing the respondent’s appeal against each of the decisions referred to

  under paragraphs (a) and (b) above.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55 As for the prayer concerning mandamus,

I made no order thereon as I was of the view that leave as respects mandamus would be

superfluous if the court were to grant the applicant the writs of certiorari prayed for,

which I did. Against the grant of such leave, the respondent now appeals.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Order accordingly.</font></p>
