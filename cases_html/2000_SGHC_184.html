<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Evidence of W/Sgt Rahizah Binte Rahim</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">4.    At the trial

proper, parties referred to the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey and 6<sup>th</sup> storey of the

flat at Blk 489 as the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor and 6<sup>th</sup> floor, which is American

English. For convenience, I have used the same in this judgment. The prosecution led

evidence that on 22 December 1999 at about 9.30 a.m., SSgt M Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah

Binte Rahim from the Central Narcotics Bureau (‘CNB’) kept observation at the

vicinity of Block 137 Yishun Ring Road.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">5.    At about

12.25 p.m., Salam was spotted at the void deck of the said block. He was wearing a greyish

long-sleeved shirt, with sleeves folded up. He boarded a taxi. The surveillance officers

followed in their vehicle. The taxi was tailed to Jurong West St 41 where Salam alighted

at the spot marked at P100/P101. He was empty handed. W/Sgt Rahizah saw him walk to Block

491, pass through Block 488 and stop at a shop at the void deck of Block 486. He bought

something and continued walking towards Block 487. He was seen carrying a red plastic bag.

He crossed over to Block 489. Subsequently, she saw him standing at the lift landing,

located near the centre of the void deck of Block 489. Later W/Sgt Rahizah spotted him

walking from the 6<sup>th</sup> floor lift landing towards the left staircase. He walked

down the said staircase and stopped at the third floor landing. After that he was seen

entering the 2<sup>nd</sup> unit from the left, which was later ascertained to be unit

#03-37 (‘flat’) on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of Block 489, Jurong West Ave 1.

Photograph P4 shows the entrance to the flat and a wooden cupboard adjacent to the steps

leading into the flat. The other photographs P5 to P10 show an extremely untidy flat with

overturned furniture, clothing, bags, rubbish and other items strewn over the hall,

bedrooms and kitchen. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">6.    At about 2.05

p.m., W/Sgt Rahizah testified that she heard on the radio set that Suboh had arrived in a

taxi. She kept a close watch on Block 489. After a while, she spotted a person with a

yellow T-shirt walking along the corridor of the 6<sup>th</sup> floor towards the

staircase on the extreme left of the block. He walked down the staircase to the 3<sup>rd</sup>

floor. Then he went inside unit #03-37.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">7.    At about 2.15

p.m., she heard through the radio set that a Malaysian vehicle JDF 755 had entered the car

park. Later she spotted a person walking along the 6<sup>th</sup> floor corridor towards

the left staircase. There was no one else walking on the corridor at that time. She

radioed a message that someone was walking along the 6<sup>th</sup> floor corridor. This

person walked down the staircase until the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor and then turned towards

unit #03-37. She saw this person standing in front of unit #03-37 for a few minutes. She

radioed a message immediately that the driver of JDF 755 was standing outside unit #03-37.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">8.    She testified

that it was her belief that the person she saw standing outside the unit was the male

Chinese driver of JDF 755 because soon after receiving the radio transmission that a male

Chinese had entered the lift, she saw someone walking on the common corridor of the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor, the level at which the lift could stop. In this block, the lift does not stop at

the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> floors.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">9.    The person

later left the said unit, climbed the staircase to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor, and walked

along the common corridor towards the lift landing at the right. She then lost sight of

him as her view of the right side of the 6<sup>th</sup> floor corridor was obstructed.

That obstruction was not due to the trees. After that, she heard on the radio set that he

was at the ground floor. She next heard at about 2.25 p.m. that the Malaysian car left the

car park.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">10.    W/Sgt

Rahizah continued to keep watch on unit # 03-37. When the two male Malays were leaving the

unit, instructions were issued to arrest them. She, SSgt Subramaniam and another party of

three CNB officers arrived at the lift landing of Block 489 at about the same time. Both

the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> accused were subsequently arrested.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">11.    During

cross-examination, she could not recall if she did or did not see the driver of the

Malaysian car appear on the 5<sup>th</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> floor staircases as he was

descending. Based on her ‘instinct’, she was able to say that he had gone down

and not up the staircase to the 7<sup>th</sup> floor. Later on, she was able to recall

that she saw the person on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor because she could see a portion of the

staircase on the fourth floor after studying photograph 10 of D7. To my mind, this part of

her evidence was more a conclusion she reached rather than an actual recollection of what

she saw.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">12.    She then

explained that she kept close observation of the staircase on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor and

the 1<sup>st</sup> floor after she saw him leave the said 3<sup>rd</sup> floor unit. But

no one came down to the ground level. Instead she saw a person walking on the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor corridor towards the lift landing. Again based on her ‘instinct’, she

concluded that the person walking on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor corridor was indeed the same

person she observed standing outside unit #03-37. She was confident of that conclusion

because nobody came down the staircase to the ground level. Furthermore, the person who

went down from the 6<sup>th</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor, and then back to the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor, was wearing the same light coloured T-shirt. When the person walking along the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor first disappeared from her view, she saw no one appearing subsequently on the 7<sup>th</sup>

floor corridor. She conceded however that she could be wrong that he was the same person.

But in the next breath she was very sure that the person who stopped at unit #03-37 was

the driver of the car JDF 755.</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">13.    From where

she was, she could not tell whether the person was a male or female but she could see that

the person had short hair. Based on the polaroid photograph of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused

taken soon after his arrest, his hair could perhaps be described as being rather long for

a man, but would be short when contrasted with a lady having shoulder length hair or

longer. I believed that W/Sgt Rahizah was trying to determine from the length of the hair

if the person she saw was a man or a woman, and in that context, she said that the person

had short hair.</font>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Evidence of SSgt M Subramaniam</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">14.    SSgt M

Subramaniam, the other officer keeping surveillance, corroborated substantially the

evidence of W/Sgt Rahizah. He saw Salam alight from a taxi at Jurong West Street 41. Salam

then proceeded to a provision shop located at the void deck of Block 486 where he bought

something. Thereafter he was seen walking towards the direction of Block 489. When SSgt

Subramaniam was at the ground level at Block 487, he noticed Salam waiting at the lift

landing of Block 489.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">15.    Salam was

next spotted walking down the staircase and entering a flat later established to be unit

#03-37. SSgt Subramaniam returned to the car park at Block 484 to re-position his vehicle

in such a way that the front of his vehicle faced Block 489, and his view was

unobstructed. He recalled parking his vehicle at the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> lot

from the right as indicated in D1. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">16.    At about

2.05 p.m., he heard on the radio set that ‘Suboh’ was spotted arriving at the

vicinity of Block 489 in a taxi. A short while later, he saw a male Malay at the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor common corridor of Block 489 walking towards the left staircase. He kept a close

watch whilst seated in his vehicle. He saw him climb down the staircase and enter the same

unit which Salam had earlier entered. Although he could not actually see his face, he

recognised Suboh’s bright yellow T-shirt.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">17.    At about

2.15 p.m., SSgt Subramaniam heard on the radio set that a Malaysian car bearing

registration number JDF 755 was spotted arriving at the vicinity of Block 489.

Subsequently, he heard that a male Chinese had alighted from the car. He was carrying a

blue plastic bag and was walking towards the lift landing of Block 489. He next heard that

the male Chinese was waiting at the lift landing of Block 489 and subsequently taking the

lift up the block. A short while later, he noticed a person walking along the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor common corridor of Block 489 towards the left staircase. He then saw him walk down

the staircase and later, stand outside unit #03-37 for about 2 minutes. At this point of

time, W/Sgt Rahizah made a radio transmission that a male Chinese was standing outside.

After a short while, this person was seen leaving. W/Sgt Rahizah made another transmission

that a male Chinese was leaving the unit. SSgt Subramanian saw him take the same staircase

up. He was later seen walking along the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common corridor of Block 489.

He could not really see the colour of the T-shirt that the person was wearing because the

colour was not striking enough.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">18.    Later he

heard on the radio set that the male Chinese was spotted coming out of the lift at the

ground level of Block 489 empty-handed. At about 2.55 p.m., he heard that the Malaysian

vehicle left the car park of Block 489. At about 3.15 p.m., he saw both the 1<sup>st</sup>

and 2<sup>nd</sup> accused coming out of the unit. He immediately radioed a message to the

others that both male Malays had left the unit. One was wearing a bright yellow T-shirt

and the other a grey T-shirt. He saw them walk up the staircase to the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor common corridor. He believed that they were going to the lift landing of the said

Block. On the instructions of ASP Ang Choe Seng, SSgt Subramaniam relayed a message on the

radio set to arrest both accused at the ground level of Block 489. He and W/Sgt Rahizah

immediately proceeded to the lift landing of Block 489 to wait for them. SSgt Goh Teck

Hock, Sgt Tony Ng and Cpl Peter Loong were also waiting there. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">19.    Counsel for

the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused seriously challenged SSgt Subramaniam’s ability to see the

3<sup>rd</sup> accused come down the staircase and stop outside unit #03-37 for a while

before returning to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common corridor via the same staircase. SSgt

Subramaniam conceded that he could not ascertain that the person he saw walking along the

6<sup>th</sup> floor common corridor was a male Chinese. Photographs (marked collectively

as D7) taken recently by the defence (some 6 months after the actual surveillance on 22

December 1999) were then used to demonstrate to the witness that his view was obstructed

by trees.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">20.    SSgt

Subramaniam’s explanation was that the trees had since grown taller, bigger and the

foliage was more dense now than 6 months ago. With that explanation, I did not find it

inherently incredible, on the basis of the Haw Tua Tau test, that he did see what he said

he saw. I had no reason at this stage of the trial, to seriously doubt the reliability of

the testimony of SSgt Subramaniam or W/Sgt Rahizah that they saw the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused descend the staircase to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor from the 6<sup>th</sup> floor

common corridor, stand outside unit #03-37 for a short while, before returning via the

same staircase to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common corridor.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">21.    Being tasked

to keep surveillance on unit #03-37 and the staircase, it was most unlikely for them to

pick a location where their view would be blocked. If there was obstruction, they would

probably move to another place where they could see clearly. This was exactly what the

witness said. SSgt Subramaniam testified that he would shift to another observation

position if indeed his view was poor and obstructed. I could find no reason why SSgt

Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah would chose to have an obstructed view unless they conspired

to sabotage the whole CNB operation. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">22.    Based on the

timing of the transmissions from other officers concerning the arrival of the car JDF 755,

the driver’s approach to the lift and his entering the lift, and their

synchronisation with his observation of the person’s appearance on the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor corridor and outside unit #03-37 on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor, SSgt Subramaniam

disagreed that it was a mere assumption on his part that this driver was the one he saw

standing outside unit #03-37, although he could not say for a fact that it was the driver

who had stood outside the said unit. It was based on his ‘instinct’, which I

took it to mean his experience as a CNB officer with 9 years of surveillance experience

working as a member of a surveillance team, where different members have to observe

different parts of the route and where they have to communicate the movements of the

subject under observation to other members of the team in real time via radio so as to

co-ordinate their coverage of the full trail of the subject in question.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">23.    Furthermore,

I noted that it was relatively quiet in the HDB estate at that time. This naturally made

the surveillance much easier. It would not be the same if there were many people taking

the lift at Block 489, walking along the common corridor on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor and

using the staircase at the time whilst they were keeping observation of the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused’s movements. In this case, only one person was observed to enter the lift at

Block 489 at that time, and one person appeared at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common

corridor a while later. Under the circumstances, it was extremely unlikely for the person

observed to proceed from the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common corridor to the unit #03-37 to be

mistaken for the driver of the Malaysian car JDF 755 on that occasion. Moreover, this

surveillance officer was positive that the person walking along the 6<sup>th</sup> floor

common corridor on that day had in fact gone to stand outside the said unit. He believed

that the driver of the said car had stood outside the said unit. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">24.    I noted that

counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> accused had not seriously challenged the

observation of these two surveillance officers on the actual route taken by Salam and

Suboh to reach the said flat via the lift to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor. This helped to

persuade me that both surveillance officers were indeed able to observe clearly on that

sunny day the 6<sup>th</sup> floor corridor and the flat on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor. This

was of considerable importance when considering the reliability of their observation in

relation to the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">25.    In any

event, the question at this stage of the trial was whether there was prima facie evidence,

<i>inter alia</i>, that the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused had in fact stood outside the said unit

#03-37 for a short while on that day. In my opinion, this test was more than amply

satisfied for the reasons given. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Evidence of SSgt Goh Teck Hock</font></p></b>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">26.    SSgt Goh

Teck Hock testified that at about 2.15 p.m. he heard on the radio set that a Malaysian

vehicle JDF 755 had arrived at the car park behind Block 489. He stationed himself at the

void deck of Block 487 to keep observation. He saw the driver of JDF 755 alight from his

vehicle and use his handphone at the void deck of Block 489. A short while later, he

returned to his car, opened the driver’s side of the car. He then saw him carry a

light blue plastic bag, rectangular in shape and of a size slightly bigger than A4 paper

size, with a white string handle attached to it similar to that in P 12 which was found to

contain the drugs seized in the flat. But he could not remember if he saw any yellow

border on the blue plastic bag. He then instructed Sgt Tony Ng to relay a message to the

others that the driver was carrying a blue plastic bag. The driver walked towards the lift

him. SSgt Goh denied that the accused walked to the end of Block 489 to ascertain the

number of the block. About 1 to 2 minutes later, he heard a radio message that the driver

was standing outside #03-37. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>

time SSgt Goh saw him was when he came out of the lift landing at Block 489. This time, he

was empty-handed. He went inside his car, reversed it and parked at another parking lot

near to Block 490. At about 2.55 p.m., he drove off from the car park of Block 490. Later

at about 3.15 p.m., he heard on the radio set that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

accused were leaving the flat. On instructions, SSgt Goh together with Sgt Tony Ng

proceeded to the lift landing of Block 489 to help arrest them.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>

arrest at about 4.20 p.m., ASP Ang Choe Seng asked SSgt Goh to identify a blue plastic bag

recovered from unit #03-37. He positively identified the blue plastic bag seized as shown

in P12 to be the one that the driver of JDF 755 was seen carrying earlier to the said

unit. According to the witness, he only saw this blue bag twice, once when the driver of

JDF 755 was carrying it and the second time when he was asked to identify it in the flat.</font>

was with SSgt Goh Teck Hock. They arrived at the scene at about 1.30 p.m. Apart from

keeping watch on Salam who had been reported to him as being inside unit #03-37, they were

told to look out for Suboh. Sgt Tony Ng said that they were shown a photograph of Suboh

prior to the surveillance on the 22<sup>nd</sup> December 1999.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">30.    At about

2.05 p.m., Sgt Tony Ng saw Suboh alight from a taxi in front of Block 489 Jurong West St

41. He wore a yellow T-shirt. He walked towards the lift landing of Block 489 and took a

lift up. Later, Sgt Tony Ng heard a radio transmission to the effect that a Malaysian car

had arrived and entered the car park. The car number was given. At about 2.15 p.m., Sgt

Tony Ng saw car JDF 755 park in front of Block 489 Jurong West Street 41. His observation

point was at the edge of the void deck of Block 487 facing Block 489. It was a clear sunny

day. He saw the driver alight from his vehicle and then move to the void deck. He was seen

making calls on his handphone. He was attired in a grey like T-Shirt. Then he went back to

his car for a short while. The driver was next spotted at the lift landing of Block 489 at

the ground level. He entered the lift.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">31.    He failed to

see whether the driver was carrying anything in his hands before entering the lift because

he was not focusing on the driver at that point of time when he had to send a radio

message given to him by his team leader, SSgt Goh, that the driver was carrying a blue

plastic bag. Sgt Tony Ng therefore could not be sure whether the driver was or was not

carrying anything when he entered the lift. A short while later, he heard a radio message

to the effect that the ‘Malaysian’ driver appeared at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor.

There was another message that this person went down to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">32.    Later, he

saw the driver emerge from the lift of Block 489. This time Sgt Tony Ng was positive that

the driver was not carrying anything as he walked back to his car. He then went into his

car and sat on the driver’s seat for a short while. This witness could not see what

the driver was doing. He later reversed and shifted his car to another parking lot. He

remained in the car for quite some time before finally driving off. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>

Block 489 to which the witness positively replied that there was.</font>

I thus directed the learned DPP to call witnesses to establish what had happened to the

two brown envelopes that were seized. Mr Matthew Lim Tow Thiam from the Financial

Investigations Department of CNB came to testify that he received two brown envelopes

containing the cash from SSgt Ang Oon Tho. He took out the money, counted them in the

presence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. Thereafter he kept the money, which was most

important as far as he was concerned. Mr Matthew Lim did not return the two brown

envelopes to SSgt Ang. He could not recall if there was any writing on the envelope. He

could not remember what happened to the two brown envelopes, which were handed over to

him. Thus, the investigating officer, ASP Fan Tuck Chee (‘ASP Fan’), never saw

the two brown envelopes because they were never handed over to him at any time. </font>

  had not been employed and was taking care of my aged mother. Only myself, my elder sister

  and two elder brothers are staying with my mother. I am the youngest child in a family of

  eleven children.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4. On the day that I was arrested, I was

  at home in the morning and I woke up at about 8.00 a.m. or 9.00 a.m. Before taking my

  breakfast at the market, I tried calling ‘Joe’ but could not get through. After

  my breakfast, I tried calling ‘Joe’ at the public phone on the ground floor of

  my block of flat to ask for his help. I wanted him to introduce work to me.

  ‘Joe’ told me that he has work to do and asked me to go to Blk 489 Jurong West

  Ave 1. ‘Joe’ said that he will be at Jurong West after 1.00 p.m. and also gave

  me directions to the unit. He told me that at Blk 489 Jurong West, I am to go up to the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  storey using the staircase which does not have a lift. He also told me that he would be in

  the first house that I came to if I were to turn right after going up the stairs.

  Immediately, I took a taxi to Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">5. I am now shown a photograph of a male

  reached Blk 489 Jurong West and alighted along the main road. I then walked to Blk 489 and

  took the lift to the 6<sup>th</sup> storey, after which I walked down the stairs to the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  storey. I knocked on the door but there was no response. I then went back to the 7<sup>th</sup>

  storey by the stairs and waited there for a while. After about 15 to 20 minutes, I went

  back to the house at the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey and knocked on the door again.

  ‘Joe’ opened the door and told me that he has work to do. He asked me to go back

  to the 7<sup>th</sup> storey and told me that he will come up to look for me after he has

  finished his work. I do not know what work he was referring to. After a while,

  ‘Joe’ came up to the 6<sup>th</sup> storey and whistled for me to join him. I

  then walked with him to the lift and he invited me to have lunch with him. We went to the

  ground floor using the lift and after coming out from the lift, a few men arrested us. I

  squatted down and was handcuffed. At the same time, I noticed ‘Joe’ running away

  towards the carpark but was stopped and he struggled with the men arresting him. I knew

  that the men were CNB officers. </font></p>

  brought up to the house at the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey, the one that I had been to earlier.

  We were brought to the hall and I remember being asked something like ‘where’s

  the thing’. I kept quiet and when asked again, I replied that I do not know. However,

  I overhead an officer asking ‘Joe’ the same question and ‘Joe’

  replying that it was already given to someone. The rooms were then searched in our

  presence and in the room nearer to the corridor, a Malay officer found a blue plastic bag

  from behind the cupboard and showed us the contents. I saw that there 5 big packets and

  some small packets of heroin in the plastic bag. I also saw a digital scale and a lot of

  empty small plastic bags. After which, ‘Joe’; and myself were asked to wait in

  the hall. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">8. About one hour or so later, the officer

  in charge of the case asked me whether I know who the drugs belong to. I replied that I do

  not know. I was then put back at the hall and a while later, some men came to take

  photographs of the heroin. After finish taking the photographs, I was brought to the CNB

  office for urine test. At the CNB office, I saw ‘Joe’. I was told by an officer

  that my urine tested positive of heroin and asked if I had smoked heroin. I told him that

  I did not smoke heroin but I did consume cough mixture and panadol because I was sick. I

  did not see a doctor as it was not serious. A childhood friend of mine whom I do not have

  the contact number of gave me a bottle of cough mixture. I do not know why my urine was

  tested positive and I believe that it is because of the cough mixture.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">9. After the urine test, I was brought to

  another CNB office where the heroin was weighed in the presence of ‘Joe’, myself

  and another male Chinese. Then, the officers brought to my home at Blk 137 Yishun Ring

  Road #04-176. A search was conducted but nothing was found. I was then brought to the

  hospital for a medical check-up and later brought back to the CNB office where my

  statement was recorded. After the statement, I was again brought to the hospital for

  another check-up and thereafter referred to the lock-up at CID.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10. I am now asked who the heroin that was

  recovered in the house at Blk 489 Jurong West belongs to. I wish to say that I do not know

  but I think that ‘Joe’ will know because he was in the house before I reached

  there. </font></p>

</b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">11. My previous statement recorded on

  30.12.99 was read back to me in Malay and I affirm it to be true and correct.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">12. I first met ‘Joe’ in Changi

  Prison sometime in 1996 or 1997. I am not close to ‘Joe’ although I was in the

  same hall with him when I was serving my sentence in Changi Prison. In November 1999, I

  met up with ‘Joe’ again by chance along Orchard Road. ‘Joe’ asked me

  if I had any pager or handphone but I did not have any. ‘Joe’ then gave me his

  handphone contact number. One or two weeks later, I went to Orchard Road and contacted

  ‘Joe’ as he always hangs out there. We just met up for a meal and I returned

  home as I was still under police supervision. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">13. Since then, I have not met nor

  contacted ‘Joe’ until a day before we were arrested when I called him on his

  handphone. I wanted to meet ‘Joe’ with the intention of asking him for contacts

  whom could provide me with work as I needed money for the coming Hari Raya celebration.

  ‘Joe’ then asked me to contact him again the next day. That was why I called

  ‘Joe’ in the morning on the day which I was arrested. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">14. Since I was released from prison in

  October 1999, I have not been working but I supported myself using money which I obtaining

  from pawning off jewellery of mine. I bought the jewellery before I was detained in

  prison. When I was first released from prisons, I managed to get by as my mother, brothers

  and sisters gave me money to spend. However, as the money that they gave me was not enough

  to support my drinking at pubs, I pawned off my jewellery and obtained S$3,500/-. This

  amount of money saw me through from November 1999 till when I was arrested in December

  1999. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">15. I am now shown a bunch of three keys

  and I wish to say that I have not seen them before (Recorder’s note:- Accused is

  shown a bunch of three keys labelled as ‘C-1’ which were seized on the day of

  arrest and were used to gain entry to Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37). I also wish to

  say again that I have never entered into the house at the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey of Blk 489

  Jurong West and that was the first time that I had been there. I also do not know who the

  house belongs to. I only know that ‘Joe’ stays somewhere in Clementi. I do not

  know whether ‘Joe’ was at Jurong West before or after I arrived as nobody

  answered the door when I knocked on it for about a minute the first time. I think that my

  knocking was quite soft and maybe ‘Joe’ did not hear me. The second time, when I

  went back to the house, I knocked on the door similarly but for a little longer and

  ‘Joe’ opened the door. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">16. As to the heroin that was found in the

  house at Blk 489 Jurong West, I do not know who it belongs to but it may belong to

  ‘Joe’ because ‘Joe’ was in the house and he was also found with heroin

  in him. Moreover, I remembered ‘Joe’ saying to a CNB officer that he had given

  ‘things’ to someone else. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. On 22.12.99, the morning on which I was

  arrested, I was at my friend’s house at Bukit Batok Central. I had stayed at the

  house of ‘Ali’ the night before. At about 12 plus in the afternoon, I woke up

  and went back to my house at Blk 407 Clementi Ave 1 #02-50. I reached home at about 1.00

  p.m. At about 1 plus in the afternoon, my friend ‘Salam’ called me on my

  handphone and asked me to go to the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey of Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1.

  ‘Salam’ also told me that when I reached the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey, I was to

  whistle and he would open the door for me. I do not know the unit which ‘Salam’

  wanted me to go to. Over the phone, ‘Salam also asked me if I wanted to help me sell

  VCDs but I do not know why ‘Salam’ asked me to go to that house. I also did not

  ask why he wanted to meet me in the house at Jurong West.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4. After receiving the call from

  ‘Salam’, I changed my clothes and left for Jurong West in a taxi. At about 15

  minutes later, I arrived at Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1. After alighting from the taxi at

  the carpark, I took the lift up to the 6<sup>th</sup> storey of the flat. I then walked

  down to the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey and at the corridor, I whistled. I then saw

  ‘Salam’ open the door to one of the houses. I went into the house and noticed

  that it was very messy. This is the first time that I had been to this house and I do not

  know whom the house belonged to. ‘Salam’ was alone in the house. After a while,

  when I asked ‘Salam’ where is the VCD, ‘Salam’ showed me a plastic bag

  containing more than ten sachets of drugs which was place on the floor in the living room.

  The drugs that I was referring to is heroin. More than twenty VCDs were also placed on top

  of the heroin. I could not remember the colour of the plastic bag. ‘Salam’ also

  told me that on that same day, someone handed to him many VCDs in a plastic bag but he was

  surprised to find that there was also heroin in the plastic bag. I wanted to take some of

  the heroin that ‘Salam’ showed me for my own consumption but ‘Salam’

  did not allow me. However, I did not listen to ‘Salam’ and took about ten

  sachets of heroin from the plastic bag. I then kept five sachets of the heroin in each of

  my front trousers pocket. ‘Salam’ scolded me but I told me that I was under

  stress and I was already consuming cannabis and ‘ecstacy’ and I might as well

  consume heroin. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">5. I am now shown a photograph of a male

  Malay whom I recognised as the ‘Salam’ whom I was referring to in my statement

  (Recorder’s note :- Accused was shown a photograph of Abdul Salam Bin Musthafa, IC :

  S7002309-A whom he identified as the ‘Salam’ he mentioned in his statement). I

  was also shown another photograph of a male Chinese whom I had never seen before and could

  not recognise meeting before (Recorder’s note :- Accused is also shown a photograph

  of Wong Kok Loong, IC: A3391382 (FOM) whom he claimed not to have met before). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6. After, I had placed the ten sachets of

  heroin into my pockets, I went to the toilet. I did not ask ‘Salam’ anything

  more about the VCD. After which, I left the house with ‘Salam’. When we left the

  house, ‘Salam’ opened the padlock to the gate and left the key in the lock

  itself. I was the one who closed the door and padlocked the gate. I had wanted to pass

  ‘Salam’ keys to him but as he was already walking up the stairs, I put the keys

  in my trousers pocket. My intention then was to return to my home in Clementi. We went up

  to the 6<sup>th</sup> storey again to take the lift down to the ground floor. After we

  came out from the lift at the ground floor, many men approached us and placed us under

  arrest. There was a struggle as I did not know why I was arrested and also did not know

  who the men were initially. I got to know that they were CNB officers later. I also knew

  that myself and a officer were injured during the struggle. I noticed that

  ‘Salam’ was also arrested. A search was conducted on me and the heroin that I

  had earlier taken was found in my trousers pockets. The keys to the house at the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  storey was also found in my pocket. ‘Salam’ and myself were then brought to the

  house at the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">7. In the house, a search was conducted in

  the presence of ‘Salam’ and myself. My head was aching then from the injury and

  I was not concentrating during the search. After a while, the officers brought me to the

  living room and I saw a few packets of heroin. I was then asked who the heroin belongs to

  and I replied that I do not know. Some time later, photographs of the house and the heroin

  were taken. I was later brought to a place where my urine was taken and tested.

  …… After which, I was brought to another office where the drugs recovered was

  weighed in front of myself, ‘Salam’ and an unknown Chinese male. Thereafter, I

  was brought to my house at Blk 407 Clement Ave 1 #02-50 where a search was conducted.

  Nothing was found there. The officers and myself then left my house and went to Alexandra

  Hospital where a doctor examined me. After the medical check, I was brought back to a CNB

  office where a charge was read to me and my statement was also recorded. I was then

  brought back to Alexandra Hospital and another check was done on me. After the medical

  examination, I was brought to the lock-up at CID. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">9. ….(Deleted) …..</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10. The last time that I smoked heroin was

  sometime in 1991 or 1992. Since then, I had never smoked heroin. On the day that I was

  arrested, I took ten sachets of heroin from ‘Salam’ as the heroin was readily

  available and I did not need to pay any money for it. ‘Salam’ also did not

  object to me taking the heroin. I do not know how long the ten sachets of heroin could

  last me as I am not a heavy heroin user. I also do not know whether I could finish using

  the heroin which I took. I thought of trying to smoke heroin to relieve my stress. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">11. I got to know ‘Salam’ in

  1996 when I was in Changi Prisons as we were inside the same hall. After I was released in

  May 1999, I did not contact ‘Salam’. Sometime in November 1999, I met

  ‘Salam’ again at Orchard Road and he asked for my contact number. I then gave

  him my handphone number 98165351 but he did not give me his contact number in return.

  Since then, ‘Salam’ had only contacted me about two or three times and talked

  only about casual topics. I had only been out with ‘Salam’ only once as he was

  under probation and could not go out at night. ‘Salam’ seldom contacts me and

  therefore I do not know much about him. I only know that he stays in Yishun or Ang Mo Kio

  and nothing more. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">12. I do not have a permanent job since I

  was released from prisons in May 1999 and I have been working as an odd-job labourer since

  then. I could not estimate my earnings but it is not more than S$2,000/- per month. I

  seldom ask my family for money but occasionally, I will ask about S$20/- or S$30/- from my

  mother. Often, I will also give my mother about S$30/- to S$50/- as spending money. I

  spend most of my money on cigarettes and do not have any savings. Often, I will meet up

  with my old friends for soccer games and visiting nightspots. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">13. About the heroin recovered in the

  house at Jurong West Ave 1, I have no idea who the drugs belongs to. It is definitely not

  mine. I also do not know whether it belongs to ‘Salam’. During the time when

  myself and ‘Salam’ were inside the house at Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1, I did not

  see anybody else inside the house and I had not been into any of the rooms before. While I

  was in the living room with ‘Salam’, I did not see him going into any of the

  rooms. As mentioned in paragraph 4 and paragraph 6 in my earlier statement, after I took

  the ten sachets of heroin from the plastic bag which ‘Salam’ had shown me, I

  went to the toilet. Before I went to the toilet, the plastic bag with the heroin was still

  on the floor in the living room. However, I did not notice where the plastic bag was after

  I came out from the toilet. ‘Salam’ did not go to the kitchen or the toilet with

  me. He was still at the living room when I came out from the toilet. Nobody ever entered

  or left the house while I was in there with ‘Salam’.</font><b><i></i></b></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Evidence of occupiers of the flat</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58.    As the drugs were

found in a flat belonging to persons other than the accused persons, the CNB officers

naturally conducted investigations on the owners of the flats. Statements were recorded

from them. They were also called by the prosecution to testify that they were not involved

with the drugs found in the flat. Defence counsel therefore had the opportunity to

cross-examine them. However, none of the counsel put to them or even suggested to them

that the drugs belonged to them. Accordingly, I ruled out their involvement with the drugs

at this trial. But for completeness, I would set out their evidence. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">59.    The

registered owners of the flat at Block 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37 are Hazlie Bin

Bolwahab (‘Hazlie’) and his wife, Sarimah Binte Rahmat (‘Sarimah’).

They are now staying with their son at Hazlie’s parents’ flat at Block 517A

Jurong West Street 52 #13-555. The flat at Block 489 was originally purchased by

Hazlie’s parents from HDB sometime in 1984. Hazlie (2<sup>nd</sup> son in the family

of 4 sons) and his three brothers stayed in this flat together with their parents. When

Hazlie got married in December 1997, his wife shifted into Block 489. Later in December

1998, Hazlie’s father bought the flat at Block 517A and sold the flat at Block 489 to

Hazlie and his wife on 1 January 1999. All of the occupants of the flat at Block 489

including Hazlie and his wife shifted to the flat at Block 517A except Hazlie’s

youngest brother and his wife. Hazlie said that he had never been back to stay at Block

489 since he shifted out. But he had occasionally returned to the flat to collect

miscellaneous items and clothing that he had left in the flat and to collect mail from the

letterbox. The last time he visited the flat was in October 1999 when he shifted his

bedroom set out to the present flat where he is staying. His father and third brother

Hazani have been to the flat on separate occasions in December 1999 to take the blender

and his motorcycle helmet respectively. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">60.    According to

Sarimah, all of the occupants of Block 489 shifted to Block 517A in December 1998. There

was some discrepancy with the evidence of Hazlie that his youngest brother, Hazafi Bin

Dolwahab, and his wife remained in Block 489 when the rest moved out. Hazlie and Sarimah

said that they have never made duplicate keys to the flat nor have they given the keys to

the flat to anybody. Neither have they lost the keys to the flat. According to them, they

share one set of keys to the flat at Block 489. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61.    The eldest son in

the family is Hazral Bin Dolwahab. He is single and employed as a supervisor at Citicab.

The last time he went back to the flat was in September or October 1999 when he retrieved

his remaining clothes left at the flat, to which he has a set of keys given to him by his

father. He confirmed that he did not lose any of the keys nor had he duplicated them or

lent them to anybody. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">62.    The third

son is Hazani Bin Dolwahab. He is single and employed as a customer service officer with

Smart Voice. He still keeps the key to the flat at Block 489 as some of his personal

belongings are kept there. He has not lent nor passed the keys to the flat to anybody. The

last occasion he visited the flat was about a week before the raid by CNB officers when he

went to collect a motorcycle helmet from the flat. He remembered locking the flat before

leaving. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">63.    Hazafi Bin

Dolwahab (‘Hazafi’) is the youngest son. He said that he is known as ‘Ah

Pit’. He had met Suboh in the Reformative Training Centre in 1995 and in Changi

Prison in 1996. After Hazafi was released from prison, Suboh had met up with him for a

drink at a coffee shop in Haig Road. Suboh had also visited him on three occasions in 1998

at his flat at Block 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37 before he and his family shifted out to

their present 5 room flat at Block 517A Jurong West Street 52 #13-555 in December 1998.

Hazafi maintained that he had never given Suboh the keys to his flat at Block 489 and

neither had he lost nor duplicated the keys to the said flat. He said that he had never

been back to that flat after moving out. Counsel for Suboh put to Hazafi that he had known

Salam in Changi Prison in 1996 and had kept in touch after their release and that he had

given the keys to his flat at Block 489 to Salam. However, Hazafi maintained that he has

never met Salam.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">64.    Dolwahab Bin Dron,

51 years of age, is the father of the four sons mentioned above. He said that he is now

staying with his wife and three of his sons, his daughter-in-law and grandson in the flat

at Block 517A. However, his other son Hazafi Bin Dolwahab (i.e. ‘Ah Pit’) has

shifted to Choa Chu Kang since he got married. He said that every son has a set of keys to

the flat. He sold the flat at Block 489 to Hazlie and his wife but they do not stay there.

Instead, Hazlie’s family lives with him. His wife takes care of their grandson.

Dolwahab said that Hazlie has not rented the flat to anybody. The last occasion he visited

the flat was about 2 weeks before the raid. He went there to collect his wife’s

potato blender that was left in the flat. The door was always locked when he visited the

flat to retrieve his things from the flat.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">65.    After

reviewing their evidence at this stage of the trial, my observation was that unless one of

them had lost the key or given the key to the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> accused, it

was unlikely for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> accused to gain access to the flat

with the keys that could open the padlock and the door lock. These two locks had not been

changed and the family of Dolwahab apparently could still enter the flat with their

original keys. So it was not the case that the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> accused

had broken into the flat and then re-installed new locks for their own access to the

exclusion of the Dolwahab family.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">66.    As the

youngest son, ‘Ah Pit’, knew Suboh apparently quite well having invited him to

the flat on three previous occasions, it was more likely in my view for Suboh to be given

the keys to the said flat by ‘Ah Pit’. It was not likely for Salam to be in

possession of the keys to the flat as ‘Ah Pit’ had confirmed that he did not

know Salam.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67.    At this stage of the

trial, my assessment of the evidence was limited to that required by the Haw Tua Tau test

to determine if their defence ought to be called.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Drug Analysis</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68.    The drugs contained

in the red plastic bag taken from the blue plastic bag (see P12) were sent to the

Department of Scientific Services for analysis. The 5 packets and 12 sachets were analysed

to contain not less than 165.67 grams of diamorphine. Of the five plastic spoons in the

red plastic bag, three were found stained with diamorphine. In the red plastic bag (see

P16) were several empty small plastic bags similar to those used to pack the drugs into

sachets.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">69.    The 10

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">70.    Dr Yeo Kim

Hai examined Salam, the 1<sup>st</sup> accused, at 0140 hours on 23 December 1999 at

Alexandra Hospital. He found bruises at Salam’s right temple, right cheek and the

right side of the nose. There was a small laceration on the right jaw. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">71.    Sgt Tony Ng

and W/Sgt Rahizah testified that they waited outside the ground floor lift landing of

Block 489 to arrest Salam. After identifying themselves, they grabbed the arms of Salam.

When Salam refused to go down upon being told to do so by W/Sgt Rahizah in Malay, Sgt Tony

Ng said he tackled the right leg of Salam with his left leg to bring him down to his

knees. Both CNB officers then forcefully pushed him down to the prone position, pinned him

down and handcuffed his hands behind his back. W/Sgt Rahizah testified that the right side

of Salam’s face was in contact with the ground after he was pushed down. It was in

that position that they handcuffed him. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">72.    Sgt Tony Ng

then placed Salam inside a CNB staff car. He did not see SSgt Subramaniam come near Salam

when he was guarding him. Thus, he never saw SSgt Subramaniam assault him at all. SSgt

Subramaniam also denied assaulting him.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">73.    Salam

testified that he did not resist his arrest nor put up any struggle. Since there was no

struggle, the injuries found on him were not the result of his arrest. They were inflicted

by the CNB officers. He asserted that he was kicked at his lower right jaw and punched on

the right side of his face by SSgt Subramanian whilst he was bending down to enter the CNB

staff car through the right rear passenger door. Then he was pushed into the car by SSgt

Subramaniam. He was questioned about a ‘key’. SSgt Subramanian punched again,

this time on the right side of his forehead. These assaults caused him to be fearful of

the CNB officers who subsequently brought him up to unit #03-37 on 22 December 1999 to

question him. He did not complain of the assaults to the doctor who examined him prior to

and after the recording of his cautioned statements because the escorting CNB officer was

present.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">74.    Counsel submitted

that his oral statements given on 22 December 1999 to SI Ronnie See and ASP Fan whilst in

the flat were involuntary because he feared that he would be further assaulted if he did

not answer the questions posed to him. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">75.    The

prosecution submitted that the bruises and laceration on the right side of his face were

sustained during his arrest when he was pushed down to the ground by Sgt Tony Ng and W/Sgt

Rahizah. When he was pinned down, the right side of his face was in fact in contact with

the ground. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">76.    I disbelieved

Salam’s allegation that he was assaulted. I failed to see how he could have been

kicked and punched by SSgt Subramaniaum as he was bending down to enter the CNB car. There

was simply not enough room between the right door and the accused for SSgt Subramaniaum,

whilst holding the accused’s shoulder, to raise his right foot to inflict the kick on

the accused’s right jaw and punch him just below the right eye as he was bending down

and was about to enter the right side of the rear passenger seat. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">77.    Salam’s

evidence that he voluntarily laid down prone on the ground on the instructions of the

arresting officers without the officers even touching him prior to his being handcuffed,

was simply unbelievable. I accepted the arresting officers’ account of the arrest.

The injuries in my judgment were caused when he was tackled and pushed forcefully down to

the prone position in the course of which the right side of his face and jaw had hit and

rubbed against the rough ground, and injuries were thereby sustained. The injuries found

were linear as reflected in the medical notes of Dr Ganesan whereas injuries caused by

punches according to Dr Ganesan would be more diffused in pattern. Hence, Dr Ganesan was

of the view that the injuries found on Salam’s face were more consistent with

injuries associated with the manner of arrest as described by the CNB officers than with

the accused being kicked and punched as alleged by him. Dr Ganesan further testified that

he would have noted it down if Salam had complained of any assault. However, there was no

such record in his medical notes.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">78.    After

evaluating all the evidence at the 1<sup>st</sup> accused’s voire dire, I found that

the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that all the oral statements were

given voluntarily by the 1<sup>st</sup> accused. No threats, inducements or promises were

made to him to obtain the oral statements. Neither was he assaulted. Accordingly, I ruled

that the oral statements sought to be admitted by the prosecution were admissible.</font>

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">79.    The CNB

officers involved with the arrest of the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused at the vicinity of the

lift landing on the ground floor of Block 489 were principally SSgt Goh Teck Hock, Sgt

Tony Ng, Cpl Peter Loong and SSgt Subramaniam. The other officers who assisted were SI

Ronnie See Su Khoon, SSgt Mohamed Isa Bin Kassim and Sgt Deen Goh Teck Kiat.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">80.    Suboh tried

desperately to escape from the arresting officers. Considerable force had to be used to

secure his arrest by tackling him to the ground. He was pinned face downwards before the

officers finally handcuffed him behind his back. In the process, the accused sustained

injuries. So did Cpl Peter Loong who dislocated his left shoulder when he gave Suboh a

rugby tackle from the rear left side of the accused’s body as the accused was running

away. This resulted in both of them falling hard on to the cement floor with Suboh landing

on top of Cpl Peter Loong’s left shoulder. When Cpl Peter Loong fell on his back,

Suboh also fell on his back but landed on top of Cpl Loong. Cpl Peter Loong basically

cushioned the fall of Suboh. I observed that Cpl Peter Loong did not suffer any injury to

the back of his head during this fall although his head would be nearer the ground. It was

unlikely for Suboh to injure the back of his head since he landed on top of Cpl Peter

Loong. Then what explanation could there be for the linear laceration measuring 2 cm at

the back of Suboh’s head?</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">81.    After this

fall, Suboh got up and tried to escape again. He was subsequently caught and pinned to the

ground face downwards at the adjacent grass verge not too far from the lift landing at

Block 489 by SSgt Subramaniam and SSgt Goh Teck Hock. He was subsequently handcuffed. I

noted that Suboh never fell on his back again. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">82.    The 2<sup>nd</sup>

accused alleged that he was hit on the back of his head with handcuffs, kicked on the left

back, punched on his left cheek just before he was handcuffed at the grass verge. He also

claimed that SSgt Mohamed Isa and Cpl Goh San had kicked him hard on his right chest and

abdominal area whilst he was seated cross-legged on the floor in the hall of the flat to

which he was brought after his arrest. They wanted to avenge the injury sustained by Cpl

Peter Loong. According to Suboh, the kicks were painful. However, the officers denied

kicking him. I did not believe that Suboh was kicked at all after his arrest as the

medical examination did not reveal injuries consistent with the alleged kicks. This

affected Suboh’s credibility somewhat for this voire dire only.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">83.    The

arresting officers denied hitting him at the back of his head with their handcuffs. They

maintained that the head laceration must have been accidentally sustained during the fall

when Cpl Peter Loong gave him a rugby tackle to bring him down. The demonstration in court

by the CNB officers reinforced my opinion that it was not likely for that fall to have

caused a single clean deep linear laceration at the back of the accused’s head. If

so, then I would be left with the accused’s assertion that the arresting officers had

hit his head with their handcuffs in the course of his arrest, which I did not find

improbable, although the accused would not really be in a position to see who and what had

actually hit him when he was lying prone face downwards on the grass verge at Block 489

and pinned down before being handcuffed.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">84.    The fact

that Suboh sustained some injuries was not disputed as Dr Leong Hoe Nam examined him at

2230 hours on the 22 December 1999, and found a linear bruise of 3 cm on his left eye, a

fairly deep linear laceration of 2 cm involving the scalp layer at the back of his head on

the left side, a semicircular erythema measuring 3 cm on his anterior right chest and

three linear erythema on the back. Dr Leong testified that the linear laceration at the

head would have significant bleeding. He stitched up the open wound. Apart from it being

consistent with the head hitting the ground during a fall, Dr Leong agreed that the linear

laceration at the back of the head would also be consistent with a blow of great force by

something blunt like a pair of handcuffs. It might cause great pain initially but the pain

would subsequently subside. Dr Leong however disagreed that the small 3 cm semicircular

erythema on the chest was consistent with a kick on the foot by a person wearing shoes. If

it were a kick as described, he would expect a larger and broader area of injury. But this

3 cm semicircular line erythema had no width. I accepted the reasons put forth by Dr Leong

on this. Suboh was obviously lying that he had been kicked hard on his right chest.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">85.    As these

assaults were not the basis for challenging the voluntariness of his statements, it is not

necessary for me to go into more detail on how these injuries could have been sustained,

and whether they had caused Suboh’s oral statements to SI Ronnie See on 22 December

1999 at about 4.15 p.m. in the flat to be involuntary. The relevance of ascertaining the

likely cause of the deep linear laceration to the back of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

accused’s head was to weigh and test the credibility of Suboh and the relevant

arresting officers as witnesses of fact. On this part of the evidence, I found that Suboh

was more credible in his testimony. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">86.    I accepted

Suboh’s evidence that the laceration at the back of his head was painful and that

there was substantial bleeding, which had smeared part of the wall of the flat against

which he was resting for some time after his arrest. The polaroid photograph of him taken

by the CNB shortly after his arrest showed that there were blood stains at the front of

his shirt and shirt collar. I believed that he did ask for medical attention. SSgt Mohamed

Isa testified that Suboh was moaning in pain while he was in the flat. He told Suboh to

bear the pain, and that he would be sent for medical treatment later. When asked whether

Suboh was groaning in pain before or after SI Ronnie See asked the questions, SSgt Mohamed

Isa said he could not recall. SSgt Mohamed Isa remembered however that Suboh had asked to

go to the hospital although he could not recall whether that request was made before or

after SI Ronnie See had asked the questions. Counsel submitted that the refusal of medical

attention in the face of the severe pain amounted to oppression which sapped his will and

led to his giving the oral statements.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">87.    I took cognisance of

the fact that Suboh refused to sign SI Ronnie See’s pocket book on which SI Ronnie

See had recorded the oral statements despite being invited to do so. Suboh testified that

he did not sign because his statements were not given voluntarily and they had not kept

their promise to send him to the hospital immediately after he had answered the questions.

It was submitted that Suboh would surely have signed the pocket book if he had given his

answers voluntarily but he did not. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">88.    Suboh

additionally challenged the voluntariness of his oral statements recorded by SI Ronnie See

on the basis that he was induced to make those statements. He testified that he had made

repeated requests both in English and Malay to be sent to the hospital. He asked SI Ronnie

See to send him for medical treatment for the injury sustained at the back of his head to

which SI Ronnie See replied that he would do so if Suboh were to answer his questions

first. Suboh testified that SI Ronnie See kept repeating the fact that unless he gave him

answers, he would not be brought to the hospital. He believed what SI Ronnie See told him.

That led him to give the answers to SI Ronnie See. Before that, Suboh said he refused to

answer the questions posed by SI Ronnie See. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">89.    SI Ronnie

See however testified that Suboh had never asked to be sent for medical treatment. I did

not believe him.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">90.    Having

regard to the totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution had not proved beyond

reasonable doubt that the oral statements were given voluntarily without being induced to

do so as alleged by the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused. Accordingly, I did not allow the 2<sup>nd</sup>

accused’s oral statements recorded by SI Ronnie See to be admitted into evidence.</font>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Voire dire of 3<sup>rd</sup> accused</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">91.    The

prosecution sought to admit the section 121 statements of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused

recorded by ASP Fan with the assistance of the interpreter, Mr Wu Nan Yong, on 23 December

1999 from 3.50 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. (1<sup>st</sup> statement ), and on 27 December 1999 from

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">92.    The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused challenged the admissibility of the 1<sup>st</sup> statement on the basis that ASP

Fan threatened to assault him and at the same time, offered him an inducement. With regard

to the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement, he was induced by ASP Fan to give it.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">93.    I will first

set out the evidence of the CNB officers on the arrest of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. SSgt

Yon Boon Ngiap and Cpl Abdullah Mohamed followed the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused’s car JDF

755 on their motorcycle after it left the car park at Block 489 Jurong West Street 41. At

the traffic light junction of Upper Thomson Road and Marymount Lane, they stopped the

lorry in front of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused’s car. Then SSgt Yon proceeded to the

front passenger side of vehicle JDF 755 taking his crash helmet with him. Cpl Abdullah

went to the driver’s side of the car.</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">94.    Meanwhile,

Senior SSgt Tan Wu Chyuan, who was with Cpl Zulkefli Bin Zakariah, stopped his CNB vehicle

right behind JDF 755. They had also tailed the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused’s car from the

car park at Block 489 Jurong West Street 41 until it was forced to stop at the traffic

light junction. Sgt David Ng and W/Sgt Delphine Tan followed in another CNB car.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">95.    After the

accused’s car was sandwiched between the lorry and the CNB car, the CNB officers Sgt

David Ng, W/Sgt Delphine Tan and Cpl Zulkefli alighted from their vehicles and ran to the

driver’s side of the vehicle JDF 755. They tried to open the car door but it was

locked. Cpl Zulfkefli showed his handcuffs to the driver of the vehicle and shouted

"CNB". They also shouted to him to open the car door but he did not. He seemed

shocked and surprised. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">96.    SSgt Yon

testified that the vehicle JDF 755 suddenly jerked forward in an apparent attempt to

escape. He concluded that the driver had refused to open the car door. Sgt David Ng

corroborated SSgt Yon’s evidence that the vehicle jerked forward slightly after the

CNB officers tried to open the driver’s car door but were unsuccessful. SSgt Yon

quickly smashed the front passenger car window with his crash helmet and opened the car

door. He entered the car, leaned across the driver and opened the car door on the

driver’s side. SSgt Yon denied that he had smashed the car window to instill fear in

the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. After unbuckling the safety belt, Sgt David Ng pulled the

driver out of the car. Cpl Zulkefli assisted him. They then pushed him against the side of

the car and Sgt David Ng handcuffed him behind his back. The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused did

not struggle. Immediately thereafter, they placed the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused in the back

seat of JDF 755 because there were onlookers. Cpl Zulkefli explained that they did not

want to create a scene or embarrass the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. It was also more secure.

Cpl Abdullah and Cpl Zulkefli sat next to him on each side. SSgt Yon then drove the

vehicle JDF 755 to Block 1 Upper Thomson Road to avoid causing a traffic congestion at the

Marymount Lane junction as the traffic flow there was heavy.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">97.    None of the

CNB officers saw any officer slap the accused’s head. No one pushed the accused head

down. The CNB officers testified that there was no conversation between the officers and

the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused at the junction of Marymount Lane after he was handcuffed. The

accused never explained about his car’s central locking system to the CNB officers.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">98.    The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused testified however that when he was stopped at the said junction, a group of people

came up to him and knocked hard at the car window with a pair of handcuffs as if they were

trying to break it. They did not identify themselves. Later he heard voices asking him to

open the car door. He tried to open it but could not because the CNB officers were lifting

up the external door handle. So he gestured to them to release the door handle. According

to the accused, the control button of the central locking system could not be activated to

unlock the car if the external door handle was being lifted up. He denied jerking his car

forward.<i> </i>He said he was frightened when SSgt Yon smashed the left front car window.

</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">99.    The CNB

officers pulled him out of the car to the road divider and handcuffed him there. During

cross-examination by the learned DPP, the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused maintained that the

officers never pressed his body against the side of JDF 755 to handcuff him. After he was

handcuffed, someone pressed his head down. Immediately thereafter he felt 3 to 4 officers

slapping his head. On further questioning, the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused elaborated that he

was told to bend his body and put his head down. So he stood at the road divider, bent his

body about 70 degrees from the vertical, put his head down and the officers were slapping

his head. I noted that he had not alluded to this manner of assault in his

examination-in-chief and he appeared to be embellishing his evidence as he was being

cross-examined. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">100.    He asked

them what they were doing, who they were and why they had hit him. However, they told him

to shut up and look down. Following that, he heard a female voice telling them in Mandarin

not to hit him. The beating stopped immediately. Following that, she asked him why he did

not open the car door. Before he could answer, the CNB officers told him to shut up and

look down. Subsequently, two officers brought him to the back seat of his vehicle.

However, it was earlier put to the CNB officers by counsel based on instructions from the

3<sup>rd</sup> accused that the driver had told them about the car’s central locking

system apparently to explain why he had not opened the car door. The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused did not allude to that at all in his testimony. In fact, he was testifying to the

contrary that he gave no explanation about the central locking system as he had no chance

to explain when the CNB officers told him to shut up. Such inconsistent instructions

demonstrated the accused’s propensity to fabricate stories as it suited him, even to

his own counsel. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">101.    W/Cpl

Delphine Tan did not see any officer pushing the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused’s head down.

Neither did she see several officers slapping the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused’s head. She

denied asking the driver why he had not opened the door to the vehicle. She denied that

she stopped the other CNB officers from slapping the accused. In fact, she was controlling

the traffic at that time, which was obviously necessary. I believed her evidence.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">102.    It was

submitted that the manner of arrest and the assaults were intended to create a climate of

fear on the part of the accused to induce him to give his statements later. It was

contended that he was slapped several times on his head because the officers were

‘frustrated’ that the accused had resisted arrest by not opening the car door. I

could not understand why the officers should harbour any frustrations or take them out on

the accused simply because he refused to open the car door at their insistence and an

officer had to smash the window to unlock the car. It also seemed unlikely for the CNB

officers to slap the accused in full view of the curious members of the public, who were

gathering to watch. I found that the slapping was concocted by the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused.

He did not seem to me to be a credible witness at all. He had no qualms fabricating a

story of how W/Cpl Delphine Tan had intervened to stop the slapping. He contradicted his

instructions to his own counsel concerning his explanation to the CNB officers about the

central locking system in his car when he was arrested at the junction of Marymount Lane.

I did not think that the CNB officers would really be interested in the central locking

system of his car when they had to worry about the security of the accused, the traffic,

and the removal of all the vehicles obstructing the busy road junction at that time. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">103.    In my opinion,

whatever was done was necessary to effect the arrest. The officers did not create any

climate of fear so that the accused would later give a statement to the investigating

officer.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">104.    The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused further said that he was frightened when he saw the injuries of the other two

accused persons at the time when they were together with him at CNB to witness the

weighing of the drugs. He was thinking that they could have been assaulted. He became

afraid because he had been allegedly beaten during his arrest. However, he did not

complain of the assaults to the doctors at the Alexandra Hospital because a CNB officer

was present during the medical examination. Yet I noted that on the next day, 23 December

1999, when his statement was being recorded, the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused apparently was no

longer afraid to complain to ASP Fan that he was assaulted, which I found a little

surprising if what he said was true. </font><i xmlns="">
<b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">105.    According

to the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused, a short, fat, middle-aged male Chinese at the CID lock-up

had told him in the early hours of 23 December 1999 that he would surely be assaulted if a

statement had not been taken.<i> </i>The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused became very frightened.

Later on the same day, he was brought from the CID lock-up to ASP Fan, who took him to his

room and then handcuffed his left hand to a chair. When he arrived, the interpreter was

not in ASP Fan’s room yet. The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused alleged that ASP Fan thereafter

told him in Mandarin that he had a lot of evidence to charge him in court. He told him

that he would have to admit it. The interpreter came in not longer after that. Before ASP

Fan recorded his statement, ASF Fan spoke to the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused directly and told

him that he must tell the truth. He did not tell him that his statement could be used

against him in court. The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused was unaware of the purpose of recording

his statement. Neither ASP Fan nor the interpreter had told him of the purpose of

recording the statement. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">106.    ASP Fan

then started asking the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused questions. Whenever he answered that he did

not know, ASP Fan ‘appeared to be very fierce’ and continued questioning him.

The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused was frightened when ASP Fan turned ‘fierce’ in his

looks. His tone of voice would change but he did not raise his voice. When the accused

replied that he did not know, ASP Fan would insist that he knew the answers. He would want

him to tell the truth. On occasions during the recording of the statement, ASP Fan spoke

directly to him in Mandarin and the interpreter would keep quiet. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">107.    When the

accused was brought to Subordinate Court No 26 to be charged on 24 December 1999, the two

male Malay co-accused had allegedly told him that they were assaulted. Apparently, the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused became even more fearful of being assaulted by the CNB officers. They had again

told him of the assaults when he was in Queenstown Remand Prison. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">108.    I

disbelieved the accused’s evidence that each of the two male Malays were so keen to

inform the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused not once, but twice, of what they alleged had happened

to them. The 1<sup>st</sup> accused would be concocting an event of assault for the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused to hear. As for the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused, he would be concocting the slapping to

tell the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. I found no good reason why they should lie to frighten

the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. Second, these two male Malays were not called at the <i>voire

dire</i> of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused to corroborate what the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused

alleged they had told him. In any event, fear which did not arise out of the acts of the

CNB officers but out of the acts of or information provided or concocted by third parties

(i.e. the short, fat, middle-aged male Chinese and the two male Malays), and self-induced

or self-generated fear were irrelevant. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">109.    The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused alleged that ASP Fan brought him again to his room for the recording of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

statement on 27 December 1999. Before the interpreter came, the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused

asked ASP Fan when he could see his family members. ASP Fan replied, "See

first," in Mandarin which the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused understood to mean to "See

the situation first." The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused agreed with the learned DPP that ASP

Fan made no promises to him about seeing his family. Later, the interpreter came in.

Again, ASP Fan told him that he must tell the truth. Not long after the commencement of

the recording of the statement, the telephone in the room rang. ASP Fan picked up the

phone and had a conversation in English with the caller. From the conversation, the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused gathered it had something to do with him. Immediately afterwards, ASP Fan asked

him who Mr Chong was. The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused replied that he was his brother-in-law.

He then asked ASP Fan when he could see his family members. ASP Fan replied, "Give a

statement first then only you can see your family members." The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused said that the first time he was allowed to see his family members was in the

middle of January 2000, which was some two weeks later. According to ASP Fan’s

records, it was the 11 January 2000.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">110.    Mr Chong

Fook Choy, the brother-in-law of the 3rd accused, testified that he contacted ASP Fan at

about 12 noon after leaving the office of M/s Palakrishnan and Partners on 27 December

1999. He asked when the family members could see the 3rd accused. However ASP Fan said,

"Not for the time being because during the investigation no one was supposed to see

him."</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">111.    The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused said that the interpreter was not all the time in the room. Sometimes he left the

room. In his absence, ASP Fan would continue with the recording of his statement and he

would ask his questions in Mandarin. The accused would answer in Mandarin.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">112.    Strangely,

for the recording of the second statement on the 27 December 1999, ASP Fan was no longer

fierce towards him. Even though the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused answered ASP Fan that he did

not know the answer, he was not fierce anymore. I found the accused’s evidence to be

quite unbelievable especially when the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement recorded was more

incriminating than the 1<sup>st</sup> statement. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">113.    The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused asserted that he would never have given the statement falsely incriminating

himself if ASP Fan had not told him that he could see his family after the recording of

the statement. He explained that he did not do it and why should he give such a statement.

He thought that once he had given a statement, he would be allowed to see his family

members immediately. He also stated affirmatively that if he had been told that the

statement might be used against him, he would never have given the statement. In other

words, he gave the statement because he was not told that the statement would be used

against him. Later, he contradicted himself when he testified that he would still give the

statement because he was afraid that he might be assaulted and he had no choice.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">114.    ASP Fan

testified that prior to recording the 1<sup>st</sup> statement, he informed the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused that he would be recording a statement from him and it was for the purpose of

investigating the case against him. He then asked the accused to tell him what actually

happened. Additionally, he informed the accused that the statement may be used against

him. He was also informed him that the statement may be used in court. All this was

interpreted to the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused by Mr Wu. ASP Fan agreed that what he told the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused here was not recorded. It was put to ASP Fan by counsel on instructions that they

were not recorded because he never said any of it to the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. ASP Fan

said that was untrue.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">115.    I could not

objectively construe what ASP Fan had told the accused to be anywhere near being an

inducement or a threat. By informing him that his statement might be used against him in

court, ASP Fan was in fact being honest and fair to the accused. Upon being so informed,

the accused could then decide for himself whether he would keep quiet. If he decided to

say something and he later found that what he said was used against him in court, I could

not see any grounds for him to complain.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">116.    ASP Fan

denied telling the accused prior to recording the 1<sup>st</sup> statement (a) that he was

bound to say truly everything he knew about the case, or (b) that he had to tell the truth

in relation to what he knew were the circumstances of the case. He again denied having

told the 3rd accused that he was bound to say truly everything he knew concerning the case

before he recorded the 2<sup>nd</sup> statement.<i> </i>The interpreter, who was present

throughout the recording of both statements, substantially corroborated ASP Fan’s

evidence. Mr Wu confirmed that section 121 (2) of the CPC was not explained to the

accused. Mr Wu further confirmed that ASP Fan never told the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused that

he was bound to state the truth in relation to the circumstances of the case. Mr Wu also

recalled that ASP Fan had told the accused that his statement might be used in court which

Mr Wu had interpreted. Counsel again asked Mr Wu whether ASP Fan told the accused (a) that

he need not say anything that might implicate him, or (b) that the accused was bound to

state the truth or to tell the truth. Mr Wu reiterated that ASP Fan did not say that.</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">117.    I noted

that counsel showed ASP Fan section 121(2) of the CPC which reads ‘<i><b>Such person

shall be bound to state truly the facts and circumstances with which he is acquainted

concerning the case save only …</b></i>’ and framed his question as if that

section 121 (2) was a ‘warning’ that ought to be administered before recording a

section 121 (1) statement from the accused. After being shown section 121(2), it was most

tempting for the witness to agree that he must, and therefore he did administer that

‘warning’ in part i.e. that he had told the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused that he was

bound to state truly the facts and circumstances, forgetting that if that were done, then

he ought not to omit telling the accused the second portion of section 121 (2) which

states, ‘<i><b>save only that he may decline to make with regard to any fact or

circumstance a statement which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or

to a penalty or forfeiture.</b></i>’ If that latter part were omitted, it would

amount to a misrepresentation of the true legal effect of section 121 (2) and the

statement may well be held to be involuntary on account of an inducement (see <i>Public

Prosecutor v Mazlan bin Maidun &amp; Anor</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 512</nobr>; <i>Public Prosecutor v Tan

Ho Teck</i> <nobr>[1988] 3 MLJ 264</nobr>.). Either the accused is appraised of the entire section in

full or not at all. Despite being tested in this way repeatedly in different ways each

time by counsel in his cross-examination, ASP Fan consistently denied that he had told the

3<sup>rd</sup> accused words to the effect that he was bound to state the truth. ASP

Fan’s practice was simply to tell the accused the purpose of recording the statement,

and then go straight into recording the statement proper. I believed him.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">118.    ASP Fan

denied that the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused had ever asked him whether he could see his family

prior to the arrival of the interpreter for the recording of his statement on 27 December

1999. He never told the accused that he would ‘see first’. Nor did he have any

conversation in Mandarin with the accused prior to the arrival of the interpreter Mr Wu.

ASP Fan maintained that Mr Wu was already in the room before the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused

came in for the recording of the statements. Throughout the recording of the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused’s statements, the interpreter was present and never left the room. ASP

Fan’s evidence in this paragraph was corroborated by Mr Wu. I again believed him.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">119.    When ASP

Fan was questioned on the telephone call from one of the members of the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused’s family, he confirmed that there was such a call but he was uncertain when

it was. Later, ASP Fan said that the call was in the midst of his investigation when the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused was still remanded at the CID lock-up. But he could not remember whether or not

that call was received when he was recording the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused’s statement.

However, he remembered the accused’s brother-in-law asking when the family members

could see him and why he was arrested. ASP Fan told him that the accused was arrested for

drug trafficking and at the moment in time, he could not grant any family visits. ASP Fan

denied telling the accused to give his statement first before he could see his family

members.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">120.    Mr Wu

clearly stated that there was no occasion when ASP Fan directly asked the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused who ‘Chong’ was, whereupon the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused answered that

Chong was his brother-in-law. Neither had he heard the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused ask ASP Fan

immediately thereafter whether he could see his family to which ASP Fan replied to the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused in Mandarin that he should give his statement first, then he could see his family.

</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">121.    I did not

believe the accused’s evidence that he had made repeated requests to ASP Fan at the

recording of his 2<sup>nd</sup> statement. I found ASP Fan and Mr Wu to be credible

witnesses and I accepted their version of the events. I thus rejected the accused’s

evidence that he had been induced to give the statements as alleged.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">122.    Even if it

were true that Mr Chong had called ASP Fan at the time when the accused’s 2<sup>nd</sup>

statement was being recorded, it must be observed that the accused was already giving the

statement without ASP Fan having promised him anything. This strongly suggested that the

alleged inducement that he could see his family after giving his statement did not in fact

cause him to give the statement in the first place. It was likely that he would have

continued giving the rest of his statement in any event. In my opinion, ASP Fan seemed

very clear that he was not going to allow any visits so long as his investigations were

ongoing. That was exactly what he told Mr Chong. I could not see any good reason why ASP

Fan would turn around and offer the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused an inducement after receiving

the phone call from Mr Chong, and risk having the statement thrown out in court, when the

3<sup>rd</sup> accused was already cooperating by volunteering his statement. In any

event, I accepted Mr Wu’s evidence that no such inducement was offered to the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused and he never heard the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused making any request to see his family

during the recording of his 2<sup>nd</sup> statement on 27 December 1999. I accepted Mr

Wu’s evidence that he was present with ASP Fan before the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused came

for the recording of his statements and he remained for the entire recording of the

statement and had acted throughout as an interpreter.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">123.    I also

found it incredible that ASP Fan, if he had intended to threaten the accused into giving a

statement, would merely look fierce and yet not raise his voice or make verbal treats to

strike fear into the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused to extract involuntary answers to his

questions. ASP Fan denied looking at the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused in a fierce manner. I did

not think that the accused would be so readily intimidated by the fierce looks and tone of

voice of ASP Fan to give a statement incriminating himself, judging by the accused’s

stand that he would never have given ASP Fan the statement if he had known that it would

be used against him.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">124.    According

to the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused, he did not have anything in mind as to what the purpose of

the statement was and he therefore would be unaware that the statement could be used

against him in court. If so, then I was not surprised that he voluntarily gave a statement

that incriminated himself as he would not be as guarded when making his statement, which

seemed more likely to be the reason why he was willing to give the incriminating

statement. His fear of the tone of ASP Fan’s voice or his fierce looks, or the

inducement that he could see his family members only after he had given the statement were

red herrings. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">125.    I did not

accept the accused’s evidence that he felt he had no choice but to give a statement.

He could well have told ASP Fan that he had nothing more to say apart from what he had

said in his voluntary Section 122(6) statement taken earlier from him, which he did not

challenge. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">126.    At the end

of the voire dire, I found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that

both Section 121 (1) statements were voluntarily given by the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused.

Accordingly, they were admitted into evidence. </font>

They were read back to the 1<sup>st</sup> accused in English by ASP Fan and the 1<sup>st</sup>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. On 22.12.99, the day when I was

  arrested, I arrived in Singapore at about 12.00 p.m. via Woodlands checkpoint. I drove

  into Singapore alone in a white Proton Wira bearing registration number JDF 755. I then

  drove straight to Blk 422 Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 to collect a receipt of handphone repair from

  my Malaysian friend Tee Chee Seong who works in Singapore. His handphone number is

  97348221. At the same time, I also borrowed about S$20,000/- contained in a large brown

  envelope from him for my illegal game arcade business in Malaysia. I am one of the

  partners in the business. A short while later, I left for Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. At about 1.00 p.m. plus, I reached the

  carpark of Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1. I then parked my car at one of the parking lots

  nearer to Blk 489. I got out from the car and called a number and spoke to the person in

  Malay. I said to him "Saya suda sambai". The person then asked me to go to the 6<sup>th</sup>

  storey in Malay. I then removed a blue plastic bag from the floorboard at the rear

  passenger seat. After which, I took the blue plastic bag and went up to the 6<sup>th</sup>

  storey corridor using the centre lift. After coming out from the lift, I turned right and

  saw a male Malay. Without speaking to him, I handed over the blue plastic bag to him and

  he in turn gave me a brown envelope in which I knew contained money. I took the lift back

  to the ground floor and went back to my car. In the car, I opened the large brown envelope

  which I got from my friend earlier on and counted the money which amounted to S$24,950.

  They were in denominations of S$1,000, S$50, and S$10. After counting the money, I placed

  both the brown envelopes underneath the front passenger seat. I then drove off intending

  to go to Ang Mo Kio Centre to collect a handphone which was sent for repairs. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4. On my way to Ang Mo Kio via PIE, I

  stopped at the traffic lights at the junction of Marymount Road and Thomson Road. Before

  the traffic lights turned green, I saw a group of men approach my car and knocked on my

  window. One of them tried opening the door at the driver’s side but could not open

  it. They then smashed the window at the front passenger’s seat. I was brought out of

  the car and handcuffed. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">5. I am now shown a blue plastic bag and I

  recognise it as the blue plastic bag that I had mentioned earlier in my statement

  (Recorder’s note :- Accused is shown a blue plastic bag labelled as ‘A1a"

  which was recovered in a raid on Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37). I am also shown two

  photographs of two male Malays but I could not recognise if they are the male Malay whom I

  earlier mentioned contacting in my statement (Recorder’s note :- Accused is shown two

  photographs of Abdul Salam Bin Musthafa, IC: S7002309-A and Suboh Bin Ramli, IC:

  S7730598-Z). However, I remembered that I have the contact number of the male Malay whom I

  mentioned speaking to over the handphone. I am now shown a grey Nokia handphone with black

  cover which I recognised as mine (Recorder’s note :- Accused is shown a grey Nokia

  handphone seized from the accused on the day of arrest and asked to retrieve the number of

  the male Malay. I found the number to be 97991601.) </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6. After I was arrested, one of the men

  drove my car to the side of the road and searched the car. I was also asked some questions

  in Mandarin. However, nothing was found and I was then brought back to an office. Later,

  three men and a women came with two dogs and the dogs started sniffing my car. The door

  panels and rear sat were also removed but nothing was found. The panels were then fixed

  back and my urine samples were taken and tested. ……… I was then brought to

  another office where an officer weighed some heroin in the presence of myself and two

  other male Malays. The money recovered from me was then counted by another officer. I was

  then given dinner before being brought to the hospital for medical check. After the

  medical check, I was again brought back to the office where the officer read out a charge

  to me and a statement was also taken from me. After the statement, I was again brought

  back to see a doctor after which I was placed in the lock-up. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">8. I am the sixth child in a family of

  seven. I started working after I had completed Form Two and at the end of 1991, I started

  to work in Singapore as a painter. I switched to working in the shipyard early last year

  and in October 1998, I went back to become a painter, working for my elder brother. In

  July 1999, I stopped working as a painter and went back to Johor Bahru. I was then not

  working but still entered Singapore frequently to visit friends. Sometime in October 1999,

  I started operating a game arcade in Taman Lenting at Johor Bahru with a Malaysian friend

  of mine. I spent about $3,000/- Malaysian Ringgit on the business, which is from both my

  savings and loan from friends.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">9. A few months ago, at a discotheque

  ‘Golden Palace’ in Johor Bahru, I got to know a Malaysian man known as ‘Ah

  Bear’. Since then, we met up often for drinks and on one occasion, ‘Ah

  Bear’ asked me if I wanted to work for him and his boss known as ‘Ngow

  Chai’ by bringing things to Singapore as he knew that I was in need of money. I have

  not seen 'Ngow Chai’ and I did not give him a reply immediately. After about a month,

  that is sometime in late October 1999, I met 'Ah Bear' again in the discotheque and I told

  me that I will take up the job he offered. ‘Ah Bear’ then asked me to wait for

  his call and I gave him my handphone number. I do not have the contact number of ‘Ah

  Bear’. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10. After a week, ‘Ah Bear’

  called me and asked me to meet him at the ‘7-11’ store at Pemas in my car JDF

  755. He handed over to me a bag and told me to enter Singapore. I then placed the bag in

  the car boot under the spare tyre. He told me that he will call me after I entered

  Singapore and give me the contact number of the person whom I was to hand over the bag to

  in Singapore. About half an hour later, I entered Singapore and ‘Ah Bear’ called

  me on my handphone and gave me the phone number of the receiver of the plastic bag, who is

  a male Malay. I then contacted the person whose number was given by ‘Ah Bear’.

  The person then asked me to go the road along Bukit Panjang Plaza and at that place, I

  handed over the plastic bag. No money was handed over to me by the male Malay. After that,

  I immediately drove back to Malaysia and met him at a coffeeshop. He handed $600/- ringgit

  to me and told me that it is for bringing three packets of things. ‘Ah Bear’ did

  not tell me what the packet of things were. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">11. On another occasion which was about a

  week or so before I was arrested, ‘Ah Bear’ called me again and I met up with

  him again at the same ‘7-11’ store. He handed over a bag to me and I again kept

  it in the car boot under the spare tyre. I entered Singapore and ‘Ah Bear’

  called me on the handphone giving me the contact number. I contacted the receiver and it

  was a male Chinese who spoke to me in Mandarin. The person asked me to go the Chinatown

  Point and over at the roadside, I handed over the plastic bag to him. No money was handed

  to me. I went back to Johor Bahru and met up with ‘Ah Bear’ at a coffeeshop,

  different from the previous occasion. This time, ‘Ah bear’ gave me $800/-

  ringgit but did not tell me the number of packets that was brought into Singapore. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">12. On the eve of my arrest, ‘Ah

  Bear’ called me at about 11.00 p.m. to inform me that I have got to work and at about

  midnight, he asked me to meet him at the same ‘7-11’ store. He then handed over

  a blue plastic bag to me and like the previous times, told me that he would call me again

  when I am in Singapore. He also told me then to enter Singapore by 12.00 p.m. I then took

  the plastic bag and left it in the car boot. He did not tell me how much he will be paying

  me after the delivery. As such, I do not know how many packets were in the bag. However,

  ‘Ah Bear’ told me to collect money from the person who collects the bag from me

  but did not tell me the amount of money I was to collect. After that, ‘Ah Bear’

  left in his own car, a blue Honda CRV. I then went home to sleep. My car was locked and

  parked at home. Nobody other than myself uses the car. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">13. On the day of my arrest, I woke up at

  about 11.00 a.m. After washing up, I went to my car and hid the plastic bag which ‘Ah

  Bear’ gave to me under the spare tyre in the car boot. After which, I left for

  Singapore in my car. At about 12.00 p.m., I entered into Singapore via Woodlands

  checkpoint. I used the green lane and was not checked by the police. As ‘Ah

  Bear’ did not call me, I went to look for a friend of mine to borrow money for my

  business. I had arranged with my friend to borrow money and therefore, I forked out time

  to collect it from him. At the carpark at Ang Mo Kio, I took out the blue plastic bag and

  transferred to the floorboard of the rear passenger seat. While removing it from the car

  boot, I saw about one to two packets of yellow substance inside the bag. I wish to say

  that I do not know what was the yellow substance. After I had collected the money from my

  friend, ‘Ah Bear’ called me and gave me the contact number for a male Malay. I

  keyed in the number into my handphone. Although I had planned to collect a handphone sent

  for repairs, I went straight to Jurong West as ‘Ah Bear’ told me that the person

  is already waiting. I immediately called the number which ‘Ah Bear’ gave me and

  the male Malay answered the call. I asked him where he was and he told me that he was at

  Blk 489 Jurong West. He also told me to call him again when I had reached there. Upon

  reaching Blk 489 Jurong West at about 1 plus p.m., I called the male Malay and he told me

  to go to the 6<sup>th</sup> storey where I handed the plastic bag to him. I also collected

  some money. After leaving Jurong West at about 2.00 p.m., I headed towards Ang Mo Kio but

  was arrested somewhere along the junction at Thomson Road and Marymount Road. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">14. Although ‘Ah bear’ did not

  tell me what the things I brought in were, I believed that the things were illegal as he

  told me to hide the things well. I never thought that if arrested, I would face the death

  penalty. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Adjourned for lunch at 12.55 p.m.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Statement resumed at 2.10 p.m.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">15. The car which I am using, a white

  Proton Wira bearing registration number JDF 755 was bought sometime in April 1999. I had

  to pay $35,000 ringgit in cash by my mother paid about $26,000/- ringgit while the rest

  was paid by me. I still have a few thousand dollars savings in my bank in Malaysia. I

  agreed to work for ‘Ah Bear’ because I was short of cash and I owed people

  money. I owed my friends about $10,000/- ringgit in total. Every month, my income from

  operating the game arcade ranges between $1,000/- to $2,000/- ringgit and that is often

  less than my spending on the car, handphone, discotheques. I will borrow money from my

  friends and that is why I owe people bout $10,000/- ringgit. I used my own car to deliver

  things for ‘Ah Bear’ as I do not know that it is so serious. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">16. I wish to say that in the Friday

  morning (24.12.99) when my case was first mentioned in court, I was taken out from my cell

  in the lock-up at CID and taken to another cell for my breakfast. I was placed in cell 3

  at that time and the cell which I was brought to was just next to the officers’ room.

  A while later, a male Malay whom was arrested on the same day with me was brought into the

  same cell. At that time, only two of us were in the cell. While waiting for our breakfast,

  the male Malay started talking to me in Malay and asked me what did I say in my statement

  and also if I recognised anybody. I told him that I informed the officer that I brought

  the plastic bag up to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor and also to collect money and I did not

  know what was in the plastic bag. The male Malay then told me that he had asked his friend

  to admit but his friend refused to. He also explained to me that as his friend has the key

  to the flat and a few sachets on the body, his friend should admit and save him. After

  that, he stopped talking to me and we were sent to court. His friend was not present then.

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">133.    At the

close of the prosecution’s case, counsel for all three accused made no submissions. I

found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against them on the charges.

Accordingly, I called them to give evidence in their defence after administering the

standard allocution. The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> accused elected to give

evidence. The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused deferred making his election. When the trial reached

the stage where he had to decide, he chose to remain silent.</font>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Defence of 1<sup>st</sup> accused</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">134.    Salam

testified that he was unemployed prior to his arrest. He had to return home by 7.00 p.m.

daily and report every Monday at the police station. He could not get a job because of

these restrictions imposed on him after his release from prison on 1 October 1999. He was

staying at his mother’s flat at Block 137 Yishun Ring Road. His family members

comprising his mother, elder sister and two elder brothers supported him initially. But in

November 1999, he felt embarrassed to ask them for more money. So he pawned his jewellery

on 9 November 1999 for $3,500 to spend on some clothes, shoes, drinking, cigarettes,

entertainment and daily expenses. He gave his mother about $500 and bought presents for

his nephews and sisters. He also spent some money on prostitutes. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">135.    He met

Suboh, who was known to him as ‘Joe’, sometime in 1996 or 1997 when he was in

Changi prison. Suboh was then in the Reformative Training Centre (‘RTC’).

Occasionally, the RTC inmates would visit the prison. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">136.    After his

release from prison, he met up with Suboh for the first time in November 1999 at Orchard

Road. Suboh gave him his handphone and pager numbers. As Salam did not have any handphone

or pager, he did not give Suboh any contact numbers. Some two weeks after that first brief

meeting, Salam phoned Suboh. They met up again, had some food and chit-chatted. But there

was no discussion about finding jobs. This second meeting was also in November. Thus far,

Salam did not regard Suboh as his close or good friend.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">137.    On 21

December 1999, the day before the arrest, Salam discussed job opportunities with his

friends over some drinks at a coffee shop at Block 101 Yishun Ring Road. According to

Salam, these friends do not consume drugs. They only drink.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">138.    Salam

needed a job badly as he had about $200 left. He needed money for the Hari Raya festive

season which was around the corner. He was also feeling bored doing nothing at home. He

had previously asked his brother and his friends to help him get a job. Then he remembered

Suboh and called him to ask if he had any job openings. Suboh told him to call again the

next day. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">139.    Salam thought that

he might have some contacts for daily-rated jobs since he had been out of prison for quite

some time. Additionally, Suboh might have friends who could help. Salam had not asked

Suboh for help in getting a job during those earlier two meetings because he had no

intention to work so soon after his release from prison. He wanted to enjoy himself first.

Later, he clarified that he could not remember whether he did or did not ask Suboh about

job opportunities on the two occasions that they had met in November 1999. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">140.    At the

coffee shop that day, Salam happened to meet for the first time another friend whom he had

met at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre. That friend, whom he suspected to be a heroin

addict from his appearance, asked Salam if he wanted to buy any drugs. Salam testified

that he bought two straws of heroin at $20 per straw since he was rather bored and his

mother did not permit consumption of alcohol at home.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">141.    Prior to

the chance meeting with this drug pusher, Salam had not met any other drug pushers since

his release from prison. When asked if he would have bought drugs if he had met another

drug pusher earlier, his frank answer was, ‘Cannot say’. I had to assess if he

would seize an opportunity when one was available. In any event, he could not resist the

temptation to buy drugs for his consumption when the first available opportunity was

presented to him, although he knew that he was still subjected to the strict Monday

reporting routine at the police station. The difficulty here was to assess whether he was

indeed involved with Suboh in an alleged drug trafficking enterprise when the golden

opportunity presented itself on 22 December 1999, having regard to his desperate need for

funds and his inability to get a job for some 2  months. There was no direct evidence

but only circumstantial evidence. The important question was whether that circumstantial

evidence had become irresistible pointing to the only conclusion that he was involved in a

joint drug trafficking enterprise. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">142.    When

cross-examined on how he was going to support his rather lavish spending, Salam explained

fairly convincingly what his plans were for the future, and why he spent so much on

himself after he pawned his jewellery for $3,500. He said that was the only time he could

enjoy himself after leaving prison. Once he started on a permanent job, he would not be

able to do so due to the restrictions of the job, police supervision and time

restrictions. He gave the impression that he would curb his spending and limit his outings

and enjoyment to perhaps once a week. For that, a job paying him about $1000 per month

would suffice. He would also be satisfied with a painter’s job paying him $50 per

day. Salam said that he was a welder at Jurong previously.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">143.    In my view, that is

a fairly skilled job. With this previous job experience, I think that the accused has the

necessary skills for a daily-rated labourer’s job or even a permanent labourer’s

job paying an amount of wages that would likely be sufficient for his needs provided he

does not spend as lavishly. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">144.    Continuing

with the events of 21 December 1999, Salam testified that he returned home from the coffee

shop and joined his family members to break the fast as it was still the fasting month.

Thereafter, he went to his room and smoked one straw. This was the first time he started

re-consuming heroin after his release from prison. Later he went to bed.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">145.    The next

morning on 22 December 1999, he called Suboh on his handphone but could not get through.

He went to the market to have his breakfast. Upon his return and before going upstairs to

his mother’s flat, he called Suboh at about 9.00 a.m and managed to contact him.

Salam told Suboh that he wanted to meet him and discuss job opportunities.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">146.    What Salam

had in mind were jobs like painting whereby he would have flexible working hours or other

daily-rated jobs whereby he could leave early and be home by 7.00 p.m. I asked the 1<sup>st</sup>

accused how would he know whether Suboh would have jobs to recommend. He said that he was

just trying his luck. He knew that Suboh had been released from jail for quite some time.

So he guessed that he must have some contacts. When pressed by the learned DPP whether

Suboh had informed him that he had a job ready for him, Salam said that he could not

remember the exact words but Suboh said something like "OK, you can come, we will

talk about it later." When asked why he bothered to go all the way to Jurong from

Yishun when Suboh never hinted whether he had a job ready for him, Salam said that he did

not mind going there because he had nothing else to do at home in any case. Even if he did

not like the kind of job, they could still go for a walk and have a meal together. He

explained that if he were to meet him, he could then talk to him about the job. He need

not have to pressurize him on the phone to tell him about the job first.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">147.    In that

telephone conversation, Suboh said that he was not free and that Salam could only see him

at about 1.00 p.m. Salam then asked where they should meet. Suboh told him to meet at

Block 489, Jurong West Avenue 1. Salam asked for directions and was told that there was a

Kentucky Fried Chicken (‘KFC’) restaurant there and the block behind was Block

489. Suboh told him to take the stairs to the third floor. The flat was the first one on

the right. Suboh also told him that there was an unused cupboard placed in front of the

unit and he would not miss it.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">148.    Salam then

voiced his concern what if he was not there when he arrived at the flat. Suboh told him to

wait downstairs for him. Salam told Suboh that his urine might be tainted with drugs and

hence, he could not meet him downstairs in case of spot-checks by the police. Salam asked

"How then?". Suboh then said that he would keep the door slightly ajar. He told

Salam to go inside the flat, close the door and wait for him, should he not be there.

After that phone call, Salam went back to his house, took his bath, consumed the second

straw of heroin at about 11.30 a.m. or 12 noon. He left his mother’s flat at about

12.30 p.m. He said that he felt high and a bit ‘blurry’ after consuming the

heroin but he was not feeling tired. Then later, he said he was still alert although he

was high, which appeared contradictory.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">149.    He took a

taxi to Block 489, Jurong West Avenue 1, because it was safer for him as he had consumed

drugs. Furthermore, he was not familiar with the Jurong area. Salam informed the driver

that the block was near a KFC outlet. However upon arrival at about 1.00 pm, the taxi

driver took a wrong turn and stopped at Jurong West Street 41. The taxi driver told Salam

to walk across the block to reach Block 489. Salam did as directed and walked in from the

main road.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">150.    As he was

walking towards the block, he saw a kiosk at the void deck of block 486. He bought two

cans of soya bean drink and was given a red plastic bag to carry them in. He was feeling

very thirsty after consuming the drugs. His throat felt uncomfortable after consuming the

second straw of heroin. After buying the drinks, he walked across to Block 487 and glanced

upwards to look at Block 489. He saw that there was indeed an old cupboard in front of the

unit. This helped him to locate the unit. He took the lift to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor,

walked along the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common corridor to the staircase on the left end of

the block, and walked down to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor. He did not take the staircase as

directed as he was feeling lazy after consuming the heroin. He explained that he had no

difficulty finding the unit because he had already spotted it from the carpark.. Further,

he stayed in a HDB flat in Yishun, where he would similarly take a lift to the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor and then walk along the common corridor to take the staircase that led down to his

mother’s flat on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor. So he was not altogether unfamiliar with

the common corridor connections to HDB flats which were not located at lift level.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">151.    When he

reached the unit with the old cupboard outside it, he found that the main door was

slightly ajar and he knew that Suboh was not in. The metal gate was not locked but it was

closed. He did not notice any padlock. Salam then went inside, closed the door and waited

for Suboh. At first, he sat on a chair in the hall and smoked a cigarette. He saw that the

whole flat was very messy. He went to the first bedroom and noticed that it was similarly

very dirty and messy. He did not enter this bedroom. In any case, it was cramped full with

items strewn all over the floor that he could not enter. He then went to the next room and

he noticed that the kitchen was dirty. He saw however that the room nearer the kitchen was

fairly empty.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">152.    His

impression was that this flat could be a place where Suboh might spend the night. He

opined that it was a common practice for young people to spend the night elsewhere instead

of their homes. He did not think that anyone lived in the flat because it was so dirty.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">153.    As his

throat was not feeling well, he took some newspapers, placed them on the floor, leaned his

back against a small cupboard and rested in the master bedroom near the attached bathroom.

There was no bed. He decided to rest in the master bedroom as it was rather spacious. He

also wanted to use the attached toilet. Whilst he was there, he consumed 1  cans of soya

bean drink and smoked cigarettes to prolong the high feeling from the drug. He found an

antique bowl and used it as an ashtray. Altogether he smoked one cigarette in the hall and

later, about five cigarettes in the master bedroom. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">154.    About 30 to

40 minutes later, Suboh arrived. He only saw Suboh when he was at the front of the master

bedroom. After they greeted each other, Salam asked if he wanted to go out immediately to

discuss about his job contacts over lunch. Suboh told him to rest first as he had some

matters to attend to, and that he should wait a while for him. Salam did not mind waiting.

Suboh then stepped out of the master bedroom, and closed the door. Before closing the

door, Suboh told him that he would call when he was ready. Salam testified that he did not

sleep but he continued to smoke to accentuate the high feeling arising from consumption of

the drug.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">155.    Counsel

questioned Salam whether he could see the front door of the flat from where he was seated,

to which he replied in the negative. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">156.    After about

45 minutes, Suboh opened the door to the master bedroom and told Salam, ‘Lan,

let’s go and eat. We can talk outside." Salam folded the newspapers and put them

aside. They then left the flat.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">157.    At first,

Salam testified that Suboh opened the main door, unlocked the padlock to the gate. Later

in cross-examination, Salam said that he did not really notice but he thought that Suboh

just opened the gate. Salam went out and waited for Suboh, who thereafter locked the door

and the gate. They both walked up the stairs with Suboh ahead of him. He just followed

Suboh. It did not cross his mind to consider that it might be easier to descend to the

ground level via the staircase than to walk up to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor to take the

lift because he was chit-chatting with Suboh at that time.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">158.    Salam was

not carrying anything except his lighter and the ‘Salem’ cigarette box with one

cigarette left. He smoked that last cigarette as he was walking up the staircase to the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor lift landing. He crushed the cigarette box and threw it away near the lift together

with the disposable lighter, which had only a small amount of lighter fuel left.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">159.    All this

while, he followed Suboh and walked along the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common corridor, took

the lift and descended to the ground floor. When the lift door opened, they were arrested.

Subsequently, they were brought up to the flat #03-37 at Block 489.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">160.    When SI

Ronnie See asked him and Suboh, "Whose house is this?", he kept quiet as he did

not know whose house it was, and he had no answer. The CNB officers conducted a search of

the unit. The officers retrieved a blue bag from the 1<sup>st</sup> bedroom (P8). Then SI

Ronnie See asked Suboh, "Whose drug is it?". He heard Suboh answer that he did

not know. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">161.    SI Ronnie

See turned to question him. Salam did not dispute that his answers, admitted into evidence

after the voire dire, were accurately recorded. However, he said that the answers he gave

(i.e. that he called Joe to meet him at the doorstep of the flat and that when he arrived

at the doorstep, Joe actually came out from the flat) were untrue. Salam explained that he

felt frightened, having entered the flat first before Suboh did. So when SI Ronnie See

asked the question, he told the CNB officer that Suboh entered the flat first.

Furthermore, Suboh had denied knowledge of the drugs. When he saw the huge amount of drugs

found, he was afraid that the CNB might accuse him of possession of those drugs because he

entered the flat first and Suboh had refused to admit to possession of the drugs.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">162.    Salam also

said that the following answers to ASP Fan were untrue.:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q2 : Where was you before you were

  arrested?<br/>

  A2 : I was with ‘Joe’ at the corridor outside.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q3 : Why did you meet ‘Joe’

  here?<br/>

  A3 : I thought that if he got heroin ‘lobang’, I could ask him to give me a bit

  for smoking for free. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">163.    Salam

reiterated that upon realising that Suboh was not admitting that the drugs belonged to him

and he had further refused to say who owned the drugs, Salam was afraid that he might be

charged for possession. So he gave ASP Fan those answers in fear and in haste. He did not

know why he gave such answers. He asserted that he went there to get a job contact from

Suboh. I questioned Salam further to find out why he answered in the manner he did:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">His Honour : Normally, when you say,

  "Got heroin ‘lobang’," what do you normally mean?<br/>

  Witness : Any method or any place where heroin can be gotten.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">His Honour : "Any place where heroin

  can be obtained?"<br/>

  Interpreter : "Obtained", yes.<br/>

  Witness : Likewise, when you use the word "lobang", it can also mean "job

  availability".</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">His Honour : Why do you think that Suboh

  would have some heroin ‘lobang’?<br/>

  Witness : Before the drugs were discovered, I didn’t know that he has any connection

  with drugs. But when once the drugs were discovered, I think he must have got some

  connection. Oh, sorry. Yes. When the drugs were discovered, I became panicky and gave this

  answer. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">164.    Salam

denied the learned DPP’s suggestion that he went all the way from Yishun to Jurong

West not to look for a job ‘lobang’ but to look for a drug ‘lobang’.

He also denied that he was ever at the doorway alone or with Suboh when the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused came to the flat #03-37. He said that he had never seen the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused

before. </font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Salam was asked:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Q4 : Did you ask him [i.e. Suboh] for any

  heroin?<br/>

  A4 : No. Because I want to go with him for lunch first.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">165.    Salam clarified

that he did not want to ask Suboh about the heroin. He just wanted to go out and have

lunch with him.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">166.    When he was

taken for the urine test, he made eye contact with Suboh and mouthed the words to him to

reveal who the owner of the drugs was. From Suboh’s facial expression, Salam knew

that he did not want to do that. Salam testified that he also mouthed to Suboh that if the

drugs belonged to him, then he should own up and if they were not his, then he should tell

who the actual owner was. Suboh did not pay attention to him. Again from his facial

expression, Salam realised that Suboh was not going to reveal anything.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>

then took him through certain parts of his long statement in particular the part where he

had walked down the stairs to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor after taking the lift to the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor. Salam testified that the following parts of his statement were untrue:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Paragraph 6</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"I knocked on the door but there was

  no response. I then went back to the 7<sup>th</sup> storey by the stairs and waited there

  for a while. After about 15 to 20 minutes, I went back to the house at the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  storey and knocked on the door again. ‘Joe’ opened the door …"</font></p>
<i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Paragraph 10</font></p>
</b></i><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"..I think that

  ‘Joe’ will know [about the drugs found] because he was in the house before I

  reached there."</font></p>
<i><b><p><font face="Times New Roman">Paragraph 15</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"..I also wish to say again that I

  have never entered into the house at the 3<sup>rd</sup> storey of Blk 489 Jurong West

  …. After I arrived as nobody answered the door when I knocked on it for about a

  minute the first time. I think that my knocking was quite soft and maybe ‘Joe"

  did not hear me. The second time, when I went back to the house, I knocked on the door

  similarly but for a little longer and ‘Joe’ opened the door."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">168.    Salam gave

the same explanation that he was afraid because Suboh had not admitted to ownership of the

drugs. So he omitted saying that he had gone into the flat first for fear that he would be

entangled in this when in actual fact he had nothing to do with the flat nor the drugs.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">169.    Salam also

retracted the following portion of paragraph 8 of his statement which he said was also

untrue:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I told him that I did not smoke heroin but

  I did consume cough mixture and panadol because I was sick. I did not see a doctor as it

  was not serious. A childhood friend of mine whom I do not have the contact number of gave

  me a bottle of cough mixture. I do not know why my urine was tested positive and I believe

  that it is because of the cough mixture. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">170.    He did not

admit to ASP Fan that he had consumed a straw of heroin on the 21 December and also a

second straw on the 22<sup>nd</sup> December 1999 because his mind was muddled and he had

just been released from prison. He did not wish to be charged in court again, imprisoned

or fined. His story about consumption of the cough mixture was false.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">171.    I observed

that Salam could readily spin a good story with sufficient details added to make it more

believable. The cough mixture story was a good example. Thus, I had to evaluate his

evidence carefully as he was a self-confessed liar. He had no hesitation to lie and

falsely implicate the other co-accused just to save his own skin.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">172.    Salam also

gave evidence on how he found he found a Nokia handphone left behind by someone on top of

a toilet in a pub. He threw away the SIM card and took the handphone back. He knew that

the SIM card belonged to someone else. He testified that in case he was caught with it and

if the handphone were inspected, then they would not find the owner’s SIM card. He

could then tell the person that the handphone belonged to him. This again showed

Salam’s ability to lie when the occasion required it.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">173.    Salam

explained that he had no intention to buy another SIM card. He did not have a job yet and

he could use the public phones. On 22 December 1999, he brought the unusable handphone

along with him as he wanted to sell the handphone perhaps for a few hundred dollars as his

funds were running low then. He only had $260 with him. He had the intention to ask Suboh

if he would be interested to buy it and if he did not want it, he could always try asking

other friends of his in Orchard Road.</font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">174.    Salam

denied Suboh’s version of the events as put to him by Suboh’s counsel. He denied

that he had the keys to open the gate and door to get into the flat before Suboh arrived.

He denied the suggestion that ‘Apid’ gave him the keys. He maintained that he

did not know Hazafi Bin Dolwahab. He denied having brought up any subject on sale of VCDs.

Nor had he shown a bag containing drugs and VCDs to Suboh. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">175.    Salam was

candid enough to admit that he was detained for 5 years for suspected drug trafficking

activities when he was cross-examined by counsel for Suboh.</font>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Prosecution’s case against Salam</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">176.    Basically,

the prosecution’s case was that Salam had gone to the flat for the purpose of taking

delivery and dealing with the drugs found in the flat on 22 December 1999. The prosecution

submitted that it was unbelievable that he had gone all the way to Yishun to meet Suboh

and discuss job opportunities, when Suboh had not yet promised him a job. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">177.    Another

point highlighted was the accused’s familiarity with the flat at Blk 489 because he

had not followed Suboh’s purported instructions to the flat via the staircase, but

had taken a lift instead to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor and then walked down to the flat on

the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">178.    The story

that Suboh left the door ajar for him was said to be unbelievable because there was no

agreement on the actual time that Suboh would be there, except that he would be there

after 1 pm. </font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">179.    The

prosecution also submitted that Salam’s story that he sat inside the master bedroom

for a total of some 1  hours with the windows closed, with no fan, no air conditioning

and with lights switched off and the door closed was incredulous. It was hardly believable

that he did not step out of the room during this whole period of time in such unbearable

conditions.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">180.    The prosecution

relied on the accused’s answer that he met Suboh because he thought that Suboh had

heroin ‘lobang’ and so he could ask Suboh to give some to him to smoke for free.

This implied that he had knowledge of the drugs found in the flat. As this answer was

given in haste, it was likely that it was true because it reflected what actually

happened.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">181.    It was

highlighted that Salam gave a total of four versions for his presence at the unit. The

first version was that given to SI Ronnie See when Salam admitted to be the one who took

the initiative to call Suboh to meet him at the front of the unit. The second version was

that given to ASP Fan at the unit when he told him that he had gone there in the hope of

getting drugs to smoke for free. The third version appeared in his investigation statement

when he informed ASP Fan that he went there because Suboh called him there to give him

some work to do and he never entered the unit at all. The fourth and final version given

in court was that Suboh told him to go there to discuss job opportunities and he entered

the unit.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">182.    The

prosecution contended that Salam had actually gone to the flat to jointly deal with the

drugs with Suboh and to take delivery of the drugs as contained the blue plastic bag from

the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused. It was not a case of innocent association with Salam. When

they left the flat, they were on their way for their drug trafficking rounds when they

were arrested.</font>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Defence of 2<sup>nd</sup> accused</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">183.    In his

defence, Suboh testified that he received a telephone call from Salam at about 1 p.m. on

22 December 1999. Salam asked him if he wanted to sell VCDs. Suboh accepted his offer.

Salam then asked him to go to Hazafi’s flat and to whistle to him upon his arrival.

When Suboh reached the flat, he whistled to Salam, who then opened the door and invited

Suboh in. In the flat, Salam showed Suboh a plastic bag with about 20 VCDs inside. He

could not remember the titles except for one which was ‘Kama Sutra’. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">184.    Suboh saw small

sachets of drugs in the plastic bag. When he asked Salam whom they belonged to, Salam

replied that he did not know. Salam told him that the plastic bag was given to him by

someone earlier. Suboh wanted to take some sachets for himself but Salam objected.

Nevertheless Suboh took some of it for his own use. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">185.    Thereafter,

he felt a need to move his bowels and he went to the toilet for about 20 minutes. He

smoked two cigarettes. After leaving the toilet, he came out into the hall and spent some

time talking with Salam. He did not see the plastic bag with the VCDs and drugs again. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">186.    Thereafter,

Salam opened the padlock of the gate with the key he had with him. He left the key in

padlock and two other keys attached. He told Suboh to lock up after him. Salam did not

wait for Suboh but walked ahead. Suboh locked the padlock and kept the 3 keys with him and

went after Salam, who by that time had climbed the staircase to the 4<sup>th</sup> floor.

Suboh managed to catch up with Salam at the lift landing on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor. He

intended to return the keys to Salam. Before he could do so, they were arrested when they

emerged from the lift at the ground level.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">187.    Suboh

denied knowledge of the drugs. He did not know the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused and never saw

him that day. Suboh however admitted to possession of the 10 sachets for the purpose of

trafficking.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">188.    He denied

that Hazafi had ever given the keys to the flat to him. He testified that he never had

possession of the keys to the flat. In the course of the trial, all the 3 keys seized as a

bunch from Suboh at the time of arrest were tested on my instructions. It was discovered

that one key opened the front gate of Hazafi’s father’s flat. Due to this fresh

evidence, Hazafi was recalled. Hazafi reversed his evidence and admitted that he had lied

on oath earlier in his testimony in Court and in his statement given at the Preliminary

Inquiry, which was admitted into evidence. He testified that he had in fact given the keys

to the flat to Suboh because Suboh wanted a place to stay. He said that the key to his

father’s flat was accidentally given when he took out the 2 other keys to give to

Suboh. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">189.    Counsel submitted

that Hazafi’s evidence was suspect because the flat, being so dirty and untidy, was

unliveable. Further it was not likely that Hazafi would permit Suboh to keep the key to

his father’s flat. Suboh’s evidence was that Hazafi had known him and Salam

while they were serving detention at Changi Prison. Counsel submitted that Hazafi gave the

keys to Salam. However, Hazafi denied knowing Salam at all. On this, Hazafi never

vacillated. He said that he knew Suboh. Suboh had even visited him at the said flat on 3

previous occasions. This was not disputed by Suboh. To me, this clearly showed that Hazafi

was on fairly good terms with Suboh, which was consistent with his evidence that he had

allowed Suboh the use of the said flat. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">190.    Counsel

suggested that Salam and Hazafi had a nefarious connection with each other involving the

use of the flat. That was why they denied knowing each other. He relied on the evasive

replies given by Hazafi that he could not remember having been detained together with

Salam at Orchard Road in November 1999, which was what Salam had told Suboh. Had Salam not

known Hazafi, Salam would not have been able to tell him about that incident. Salam

admitted that he was arrested at Far East Plaza and was taken to Tanglin Police Station

but he denied that he was with Hazafi or that he told Suboh about this incident. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">191.    Counsel

challenged Salam’s defence that he had not been to the flat before. He tried to

establish that it was Salam and not Suboh who had the keys and was using the flat for his

drug activities. He submitted that Salam had given false statements to the CNB officers

that Suboh was in the flat before he arrived there. After becoming aware of the

observations of the CNB officers, he fabricated another account in his oral evidence to

continue pushing the responsibility for the drugs to Suboh. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">192.    Counsel

contended that Suboh had consistently denied that he had anything to do with the flat. The

fact that a pair of unidentified slippers were found outside the flat, and three

unidentified persons were seen entering the flat about a week before gave rise to a

reasonable doubt whether Suboh had possession of the drugs in question because other

persons did have access to the flat. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">193.    It was

further submitted that no adverse influence could be brought against Suboh for not saying

anything in his defence in his S 122(6) statement because he was tired, his head was

injured and the statement was taken about 1.30 a.m. in the morning. </font>

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">194.    Although

the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused elected to remain silent, witnesses were called on his behalf

to cast doubt on the evidence of the surveillance officers, W/Sgt Rahizah and SSgt

Subramaniam that they saw the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused walk along the 6<sup>th</sup> floor

common corridor, and then down to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor where he stopped for a while

outside unit #03-37, and then up again to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor back to where he came

from. The CNB surveillance officers admitted that they could not determine the gender or

the race of the person who eventually stood outside the unit for a while.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">195.    Counsel

highlighted that both SSgt Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah relied on their

‘instinct’ to conclude that it was the driver of JDF 755 who stood outside the

unit for a while on that day in question. Hence, their evidence was unreliable.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">196.    Counsel

submitted that SSgt Goh and Sgt Tony Ng had a clear view of #03-37 from their observation

position. Their failure to steal a glance at #03-37 meant that there were no radio

messages alerting them that ‘<i>someone was walking along the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor’</i> or ‘<i>the male Chinese is standing outside unit #03-37’</i>.

Otherwise, they would have looked at the unit which they did not.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">197.    I did not

agree because there was sufficient corroborative evidence from other CNB officers that

they did hear the message. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">198.    If SSgt Goh

and Sgt Tony Ng had said that they kept a close watch at #03-37 and yet they never saw the

3<sup>rd</sup> accused stop at #03-37, then counsel would be correct that the evidence of

SSgt Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah was unreliable. But if they had not in fact kept watch

of the unit, then it would not follow that their failure to see the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused

standing outside the unit would necessarily cast doubt on the evidence of SSgt Subramaniam

and W/Sgt Rahizah. In a large operation, each team would naturally have its own function

to perform.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">199.    What was

clear was that SSgt Subramaniam’s and W/Sgt Rahizah’s observations of Suboh and

Salam taking the lift to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor, walking along the 6<sup>th</sup> floor

common corridor and coming down to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor and then entering the flat

were accurate. Suboh and Salam never challenged that what the surveillance officers saw

was not what they did. Their testimony in court confirmed the accuracy of the surveillance

of these two officers. If they could not see Salam and Suboh leave the flat and proceed to

the lift on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor, then how could the CNB officers be mobilised to wait

for them right outside the lift landing on the ground floor just in time to make the

arrests. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">200.    In my mind,

it adequately demonstrated that the surveillance officers could observe the movements

reliably of persons moving from the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common corridor to the 3<sup>rd</sup>

floor flat via the staircase and vice versa. There would of course be instances where the

subject could not be seen and then could be seen again in particular as they climbed the

staircase. Based on their experience, they would be able to track the subject although

there might be instances when they lose direct sight of the subject but they could pick up

the movement or trail again when the subject reappeared. This would not be difficult at

all in my view since it was in the afternoon on a working day and thus, the place was

relatively quiet at that time. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">201.    The defence

called Mr Yoha Anantha to testify that the view from the car park lot where the

surveillance officers kept observation from was obstructed by the trees. The unit #03-37

and the staircase leading thereto could not be seen because a particular vertical

sub-branch of a tree (Tree B nearest to Block 489 at exhibit D 23) was obstructing the

view.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">202.    The

horticultural contractor for Jurong West, Mr Kwek Swee Hin, testified that in February

1999, those trees were pruned to reduce their height. Prior to that, they were about 4 to

5 storeys high. However, that vertical sub-branch in question was not cut. Mr Wong Yew

Kwan, a consultant horticulturist and the former Commissioner of Parks and Recreation

Department and Director of Botanic Gardens, after examining the tree in question,

testified that the vertical sub-branch would have been there in December 1999. He said

however that it was likely that it might be shorter and its bushy base could also have

been lower in December 1999 than on 8 August 2000, when the photographs were taken to show

the obstructed view.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">203.    As for the

taller tree (Tree B nearer Block 487 at exhibit D23) that was obstructing a part of the

view of 6th floor corridor, it would appear from the evidence that it was not likely for

this tree to have obstructed the view for any significant length of the 6th floor corridor

in December 1999. In my judgment, a surveillance officer could easily track the subject

along the 6th floor corridor even if a small section was obstructed because the person

would be seen disappearing and then reappearing as he walked along the corridor.</font>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Statement of 3<sup>rd</sup> accused</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">204.    Counsel

relied on Suboh’s statement to the CNB that he was on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor

corridor, where he handed over his blue plastic bag to the person at the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor lift landing. Prior to that, he was seen talking on his mobile phone at the void

deck. He submitted that the phone call was not traced to the mobile phone of Suboh. The 1<sup>st</sup>

accused had a mobile phone but it was not working. Hence, counsel submitted that the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused did not contact either the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> accused persons when

he arrived at Blk 489. The person he telephoned was traced by the CNB but was not called

by the prosecution to testify.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">205.    Counsel

surmised that the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused gave a blue plastic bag to this person. The blue

plastic bag he was seen carrying was a common bag that could be purchased in Johore Bahru

Malaysia. During a search of the flat on 11 August 2000, there were 3 similar blue bags

found inside. In the flat was another green bag identical to the green bag found to

contain the drugs. This suggested that the green bag and blue bag containing the drugs

could not with any certainty be said to have come from him. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">206.    Counsel

submitted that it could not be reasonably inferred from his statements that he had

delivered drugs to the flat. Throughout his statements, he consistently maintained his

stand that he never went to the flat. He had only passed the blue plastic bag he was

carrying to a male Malay on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor lift landing. The accused had

maintained his stand that he never delivered any blue plastic bag to any person at the

said flat on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">207.    It was

postulated that the flat could perhaps even be a drug den and be used to store drugs as 3

persons were seen entering the flat by a neighbour sometime in December 1999, after the

Dolwahabs had moved out. The 3 persons could not be identified. It was submitted that the

drugs could have been there long before 22 December 1999. As such, the circumstantial

evidence did not lead inevitably and inexorably to one and only one conclusion that the

drugs were delivered by the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused to the flat. Other probable

permutations existed as well. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">208.    Counsel

emphasized that the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused was not apprehended carrying drugs on his

person. Neither were his fingerprints found on the bags containing the drugs. Salam and

Suboh had not implicated him at all.</font>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">My Findings</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b><a name="_Toc492432406">
<p align="justify"></p></a><font face="Times New Roman">(a) 1<sup>st</sup> accused</font></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">209.    Salam was not found

in possession of the keys to the flat. The keys were found instead on Suboh. Most of the

members of the Dolwahab family including Hazafi testified that Salam was not known to

them. Hazafi knew Suboh and Hazafi later confessed that he gave the flat keys to Suboh.

Thus, it was Suboh and not Salam who had lied about the keys.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">210.    I believed

Salam that he did not have the keys to the flat and that he had never been to the flat

before. If he had been there before, he would probably have directed the taxi driver to

drive straight into the car park of Blk 489 as was the case with Suboh. The taxi which

brought him there in fact stopped some distance away from Blk 489 at Jurong West St 41.

Further, I observed that the route (exhibit D1) he took after buying the soya bean drinks

at Blk 486 was not diagonally across the car park and directly to Blk 489. Instead he

walked to the opposite Blk 487 where he said he looked across to Blk 489 to locate the

cupboard outside the flat as described by Suboh. The indirect route taken appeared to be

more consistent with unfamiliarity than familiarity with where the flat was located.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">211.    The empty

can of soya bean drink, old newspapers and some antique cups/bowls found in the subsequent

joint inspection of the master bedroom of the flat, confirmed important features of

Salam’s account that he was resting in the master bedroom, smoking cigarettes to

prolong the high feeling after having taken a straw of heroin before going to the flat.

When he was in the master bedroom, Suboh told him to rest as he had something to attend

to. Suboh then closed the master bedroom door. In my judgment, it was at this time that

the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused delivered the blue plastic bag of drugs to Suboh. It was not

likely therefore for Salam to be aware of the drug delivery.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">212.    Salam was

recently released from prison. He was looking for a job. The important question was

whether he was looking for a legitimate job or was he looking for a ‘drug

trafficking’ job, or was he already by that time involved with Suboh trafficking in

drugs. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">213.    Salam

testified that he bought 2 straws of heroin. If he was already a drug trafficker, I could

not see any reason why he should have to buy straws of heroin from other traffickers when

he himself would have ample supply of straws himself. It did not make sense to me. </font><i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">214.    Salam

appeared to be short of money. He did not even have a working handphone or a pager with

him. Again, this did not quite fit the profile of a trafficker. A trafficker would need

the means of communication to enable his clients to contact him. I did not think that he

would distribute his mother’s home telephone number to his clients. That he was short

of money indicated at least to me that, if he was a trafficker, he was not a successful

one. More likely, he was not a trafficker or not a trafficker yet. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">215.    At the time

of arrest, 10 sachets were found on Suboh. It was significant that none was found on

Salam. Salam did not know Suboh that well. With a longer period of association with Suboh

and if Salam were not to find a legitimate job soon enough, Salam might well be sucked

into the lucrative drug trafficking business, given the fact that Salam was already back

to consuming heroin about 3 months after his release from prison. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">216.    However, I

was inclined to think that at the time of his arrest, Suboh might not have trusted Salam

well enough to let Salam into his trafficking activities which Suboh probably operated

from the flat. As such, Salam was not involved yet. But the law in this case does not

punish a person for what he might do in the future. Thus, however likely it might be for a

jobless Salam to be involved in the future with Suboh in drug trafficking to support an

expensive heroin addiction, it was altogether irrelevant.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">217.    Although

Salam retracted a number of his statements to the CNB officers after his arrest which

showed him to be a self-confessed liar, nevertheless I was prepared to accept his evidence

given at the trial proper after I had carefully scrutinised his evidence. He appeared

fairly forthright and candid. I was to some extent impressed by the consistency of his

evidence not only on a general level but also in the details despite being tested quite

severely in cross-examination by counsel for Suboh and by the DPP. He came out

surprisingly well. I was surprised at his candour about his past which he revealed without

hesitation during cross-examination by counsel for Suboh. In any event, it did not

prejudice him. I reminded myself that a convicted criminal can reform his ways. What was

most important was whether he did or did not traffick at that time in the drugs seized.

One should not conclude on the basis of past drug trafficking activities that he must

therefore be trafficking in drugs again.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">218.    I tested

his evidence against the objective evidence. I was fully conscious of the fact that an

accused person might want to tailor his evidence to fit the objective facts as closely as

possible to give it a veneer of believability, sufficient to raise at least a reasonable

doubt. Much as I would like to think that there was a lurking suspicion that he might well

be involved based on the circumstantial evidence, I did not think that it was sufficient

for to me to convict Salam on the criminal charge based on a high standard of proof of

beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstantial evidence did not point irresistibly to the

conclusion that he had a common intention to traffick in the said drugs together with

Suboh. As would be seen later, I found that the prosecution succeeded only to a limited

extent in proving that Suboh was involved with the trafficking but not Salam. Suboh was a

sole operator in this case and there was a reasonable doubt in my mind that Suboh had

already gotten Salam involved in his drug trafficking enterprise, or that he was prepared

at that meeting on 22 December 1999, to allow Salam to participate. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">219.    In my mind,

Suboh might well be planning to rope Salam in. Having regard to the particular

circumstances of Salam at that time, I would not be surprised if Salam would be delighted

at the opportunity to assist and earn some money. But the arrest in my mind probably

occurred before that stage was reached. If they had not been arrested, it might well be

that Salam would have seen what Suboh was going to do with the 10 sachets, but that would

not be relevant. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">220.    

Accordingly, I acquitted and discharged the accused as the prosecution had failed to prove

the charge against the 1<sup>st</sup> accused beyond reasonable doubt. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(b) 2<sup>nd</sup> accused</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">221.    Suboh was

released from the Reformative Training Centre in February 1998. He was arrested again in

November 1998 and released in May 1999. Suboh could not give a proper history of his

employment when he was not in prison and how he was able to support his cannabis and

ecstasy consumption.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">222.    Suboh

testified that he was not close to Salam. Suboh admitted that he had to stay away from his

residence on occasions to avoid being arrested by the Police for some outstanding matters

with the Clementi Police Division HQ. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">223.    In his

statement, Suboh said that he had never been to the flat before. However, Hazafie

confessed that he had handed over the key to Suboh sometime in November 1999 when Suboh

asked him to allow him to stay in the flat. I believed Hazafie. The fact that the keys to

the flat were found on Suboh and not Salam confirmed what Hazafie had said.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">224.    

Suboh’s story that he grabbed the 10 sachets for his own consumption from a plastic

bag containing VCDs which Salam showed to him in the flat was unbelievable. Having been

arrested with the 10 sachets in his trouser pockets on his way out, which would be beyond

what would normally be required for self-consumption for a day, Suboh had no alternative

but to confess to trafficking in them in his evidence-in-chief in court. In fact, his own

counsel referred to his s 122 (6) statement given in relation to the charge of trafficking

in the 10 sachets found on him, wherein he admitted to the charge and pleaded for

leniency. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">225.    In my

opinion, Suboh was faced with no alternative but to concoct a story as to how he got hold

of these 10 sachets from the flat, without being associated with the other packets of

drugs found there. Thus he fabricated a story that Salam showed him a bag of VCDs

containing drugs, which suggested that Suboh was entirely responsible for the drugs found

in the flat. I rejected his story. No VCDs were found in the flat when the CNB officers

searched the flat. Neither were there VCDs found at the subsequent joint inspection on 11

August 2000 by the parties. Only an empty VCD/music cellophane wrapper was found on top of

the cupboard seen in photograph P6.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">226.    I further drew an

adverse inference against him that he was not at all involved with the drugs, when he

declined to state any defence whatsoever, when invited to do so in his s 122(6) cautioned

statement, wherein he said "I have nothing to say right now."</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">227.    Suboh had a

working handphone and a pager. Clients could therefore readily contact him. He had the

keys to the flat. I inferred that he was using the flat as his base for drug trafficking

activities from the time that Hazafi had given him the keys. He was clearly going for his

drug trafficking rounds when he was caught with the 10 sachets. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">228.    He could

not give a reasonable account of what he did in the flat from 2.05 pm to 3.20 pm. By his

own evidence, he saw the sachets of drugs before he went inside the toilet for some 20

minutes. He testified that apart from the time spent in the toilet, he was in the hall of

the flat. If the drugs were delivered at the time he was in the toilet, then he would not

have seen any drugs prior to his going to the toilet. By that evidence, it suggested that

he was present in the hall at the time the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused delivered the drugs. The

irresistible conclusion was that he and not Salam took delivery of the blue plastic bag

with the drugs. It was he who had, whilst Salam was resting in the master bedroom,

repacked some of the drugs into the sachets, which accounted for the empty torn plastic

bag (stained with heroin) and the cellophane wrapper found in the kitchen (which was

similar to that used for wrapping the other packets of drugs). After repacking, he then

placed 10 sachets in his pockets to get ready for his trafficking rounds. Thereafter, he

hid the blue plastic bag containing the drugs and the other drug trafficking paraphernalia

behind the cupboard in the flat. There was no reliable evidence to show that Salam knew

about this hidden blue plastic bag. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">229.    In my judgment,

Suboh had physical possession of the drugs in the flat as well as the requisite mens rea

for trafficking.</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">S 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act Cap 185

  states: </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Any person who is proved to have had in

  his possession more than </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">be presumed to have had the drug in his

  drug was not for that purpose.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">230.    The 2<sup>nd</sup>

accused failed to adduce any reliable evidence to rebut the presumption against him. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">231.    

Accordingly, the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had trafficked in

the drugs. I amended the charge that he trafficked alone in the drugs and I convicted him

on the amended charge.</font>
<p xmlns=""><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(c) 3<sup>rd</sup> accused</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">232.    The 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused remained silent. At the end of the trial, I had to consider his s 122(1) statement

which was inculpatory in certain parts and exculpatory in other parts. In considering a

mixed statement such as this, I applied the approach stated in <i>Chan Kim Choi v Public

Prosecutor</i> <nobr>[1991] SLR 34</nobr> where Lai Kew Chai J said:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The House of Lords answered the question

  by ruling that the whole statement constituted evidence of the truth of the facts it

  asserted and the judge should have directed the jury that both the incriminating parts and

  the excuses or explanations must be considered in determining where the truth lies,

  although where appropriate, as it usually would be, the judge might, and should have,

  pointed out that the incriminating parts were likely to be true whereas the excuses did

  not carry the same weight. …In our considered view, the law in Singapore in relation

  to the evidential status of mixed statements admitted under s 122(5) of the CPC is

  precisely the same. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">233.    Tee Chee Seong

testified that he had on that day loaned him a sum of $20,000, which was in small

denominations and with no $1000 notes. At the time of his arrest, he had a total of

$34,450. There were seven $1000 bills. Where did the balance sum of $14,450 come from? I

inferred that a substantial part of that must have been given to him in exchange for the

blue plastic bag. Whatever was there in the blue plastic bag was worth quite a lot of

money. What could that be?</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">234.    Based on

the exculpatory parts of his s 121 statement, that he only delivered a blue bag to someone

who met him at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor lift landing but not to someone in the flat on the

3<sup>rd</sup> floor, counsel submitted that he ought to be acquitted. I could not ascribe

much weight to these exculpatory parts for the following reasons.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">235.    After

careful evaluation, I did not think those exculpatory parts were true that he did not go

to the flat on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor to deliver the blue plastic bag. No one was called

to testify on behalf of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused that he took delivery on the 6<sup>th</sup>

floor of a blue plastic bag from the accused, which contained something which was not

drugs but was some ‘yellow substance’. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">236.    His refusal

to testify and be subjected to cross-examination did not help his defence at all. On the

contrary, it lent credence to what the surveillance officers saw. I found it most unlikely

that there were apparently two things co-incidentally happening: a different man seen

appearing outside the flat at the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor at about the same time that the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused was purportedly delivering a blue plastic bag containing something illegal to

another male Malay on the 6<sup>th</sup> floor, which no one else saw. I drew an adverse

inference against the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused under s 196(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code

(Cap 78) of that co-incidence happening. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">237.    There was

ample credible evidence from SSgt Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah and the surveillance team,

supported by evidence of contemporaneous radio message communications, that the driver of

JDF 755 had indeed gone up to the 6<sup>th</sup> floor of the Blk 489 via the lift, walked

along the common corridor, walked down the stairs to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor, stood

outside the said flat and later leaving the way he came from. He was seen carrying a blue

plastic bag when he went up the lift and later, he was no longer seen with the blue

plastic bag when he returned to his car. The totality of the surveillance evidence led me

to the inexorable conclusion that the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused had delivered a blue plastic

bag to a person at the said flat on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">238.    I must

emphasize that the prosecution’s case against the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused was not

entirely based on this surveillance evidence alone but was corroborated by the inculpatory

parts of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused’s s 121 statement.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">239.    The 3<sup>rd</sup> accused

had confessed in substance to the following :</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) ‘Ah Bear’ had previously asked him to carry

  packets of items into Singapore. He had done so and was paid. He made these deliveries

  because he was short of money.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) On the eve of his arrest ‘Ah Bear’ asked him

  again to make delivery of items into Singapore. Ah Bear handed a <b>blue plastic bag</b>

  to him. He did not know the <b>number of packets</b> inside. ‘Ah Bear’ told him

  to <b>collect money</b> from the person he was handing the blue plastic bag over. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) On the day of his arrest, he hid the plastic bag under

  the spare tyre in the boot of his car JDF 755. He believed that the things he carried were

  <b>illegal</b> as ‘Ah Bear’ had previously told him to hide them well. But he

  never thought that he would face the death penalty if arrested.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) When he was at Ang Mo Kio, he removed the blue plastic

  bag and transferred it to the floorboard of the rear passenger seat. He saw about one to

  two packets of <b>yellow substance</b> inside the bag. He called a number provided

  subsequently by ‘Ah Bear’ and the male Malay told him that he was at Blk 489

  Jurong West. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) Upon reaching Blk 489, he called the male Malay again

  and was told to go to the 6th storey. He went to the 6th story where he <b>met a male

  Malay</b>, and <b>handed the blue plastic to him</b> and collected a brown envelope

  containing money from him. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(f) He was shown the blue plastic bag

  seized and he recognised and <b>identified it as the blue plastic bag</b> mentioned in his

  statement which he said he was carrying when he went up the lift of Blk 489.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">240.    Much was

made of the fact by the defence that the handphone no. 979916901 traced on the 3<sup>rd</sup>

accused’s handphone was not traced to the handphone of Suboh. The person traced to

that handphone number was not called to give evidence by either side. There was no

evidence as to the time of the call and whether that call was indeed the same call he was

seen making when he arrived at Blk 489. In my view, the existence of the call per se was

insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case that the accused

did deliver a blue plastic bag of drugs to the said flat.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">241.    The defence

produced photographs of the scene taken about half a year after the arrest to show that

the view of the surveillance officers were blocked by trees. Hence, it was submitted that

SSgt Subramanian and W/Sgt Rahizah did not see the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused go to the flat.

I noted that the high contrast in the photographs would give the wrong impression that the

features under a shadow would not be discernable with the naked eye. The photographer

admitted that the photos D7(1) – (26) were taken when the sky was overcast and it was

drizzling. The surveillance by the CNB officers on the other hand was done on a bright

sunny day in the afternoon. Hence, the photographs would not reflect or reproduce the

visual clarity that the surveillance officers had. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">242.    I accepted

the prosecution’s submission that Mr Kwek was not able to describe the state and size

of the trees as in December 1999. Photographs D7 (No: 32 and 34) in any case appeared to

show that the line of sight from the car park at which observation was kept to the flat

was not completely obstructed. Further, the view of the 6<sup>th</sup> floor common

corridor at Blk 489 would not be obstructed based on the height estimation provided Mr

Wong, which was marked on Exhibit D7 (No 7).</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">243.    I could not

place much weight on the testimony of the defence witnesses called in relation to the

obstruction of the surveillance officers’ view. They were not there at the time of

the incident. They did not see the actual state of the vertical sub-branch, the main

branches and the density of the foliage of the trees. Although Mr Wong could say that the

sub-branch was there and had never been cut, he could not say how dense the foliage of the

branches were on the day in question. </font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">244.    The

testimony of the CNB surveillance officers was that the foliage of the trees was much less

dense and their view was not obstructed at that time.<b> </b>I accepted the testimony of

the surveillance officers that they did see the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused at the door step of

the said flat. They were sufficiently experienced surveillance officers who did track the

movement of the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused from the common corridor to the flat although there

would be instances where they lost sight of him as he was descending and ascending the

staircase. Being an afternoon on a working day, I accepted the evidence of the CNB

surveillance officers that the place was rather deserted. As such, it would be most

unlikely for the surveillance officers to confuse the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused with another

person who happened to be around the vicinity of the 6<sup>th</sup> floor and 3<sup>rd</sup>

floor at that time at Blk 489.</font>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"></p></b></i><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">245.    Based on

the totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable

doubt that the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused had delivered the seized drugs in the blue plastic

bag to Suboh at the flat on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of Blk 489. Accordingly, I convicted

the 3<sup>rd</sup> accused on an amended charge of delivery of 165.67 grams of diamorphine

to Suboh.</font>
