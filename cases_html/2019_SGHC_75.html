These are my findings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The accused was convicted of a charge of trafficking in not less than 35.21 grams of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). He was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. My grounds of decision are contained in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh and another </span>[2016] SGHC 217 (“GD”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The case turned on the accused’s knowledge that a plastic bag which he handed to the co-accused contained the drugs. The plastic bag was in the bus which the accused drove from Malaysia to Singapore. The accused’s defence was that he did not know that the plastic bag contained anything illegal or specifically, the drugs. As explained in [37]–[50] of the GD, based on the facts and circumstances, I found that he had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs contained in s 18(2) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the trial, the accused was represented by Mr Singa Retnam (“Mr Retnam”), as lead counsel, Mr Dhanaraj James Selvaraj (“Mr Selvaraj”), as assisting counsel and Mr Gino Hardial Singh (“Mr GH Singh”), as junior assisting counsel (“the previous lawyers”). The accused appealed against the decision, and is now represented by a new set of lawyers led by Mr Bachoo Mohan Singh (“Mr BM Singh”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At the appeal hearing on 12 February 2018, the accused applied, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for leave to adduce further evidence of his personal and financial circumstances, so as to establish that he had no reason to carry drugs into Singapore. The Court of Appeal observed that the further evidence was available at trial. The further evidence was also directly contrary to many of the statements given and assertions made by the accused at the trial. This would affect the reliability of the evidence. These points militated against the admission of the further evidence. However, the Court of Appeal highlighted that there was a possibility that the position taken below while the accused was represented by the previous lawyers was not the position he had instructed them to take.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Therefore, the Court of Appeal granted the accused leave to file an affidavit setting out his exact instructions to Mr Retnam on the points he has pursued on appeal, and how those instructions varied from the position that Mr Retnam in fact took at the trial. A copy of the affidavit was to be made available to Mr Retnam, with a waiver of privilege to the extent needed to allow Mr Retnam to furnish a written response to the allegations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In accordance with the directions, the accused filed his affidavit on 12 March 2018.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 At the further hearing on 26 March 2018, pursuant to s 392(1) of the CPC, the Court of Appeal remitted the matter to me to take additional evidence with the following directions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having regard to the gravity of the allegations that have been levelled by [the accused] against the lawyers who represented him at the trial, the central thrust of which is that his lawyers below did not represent him in accordance with his instructions, pursuant to s 392 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”), we remit the matter to the trial judge (“the Judge”) to take additional evidence <span class="font-italic">on the narrow question of whether [</span><span class="font-italic">the accused’s] case at trial was presented in accordance with his instructions as set out in the affidavits he has filed in [the criminal motion</span>]. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Once the taking of the evidence is completed, the court is to return the record to the Court of Appeal in accordance with s 392(3) of the CPC, and to state under s 392(4) of the CPC, what effect, if any, the additional evidence has on the earlier verdict. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The remittal proceedings  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 By [8] above, the remittal proceedings concern “the narrow question of whether [the accused’s] case at trial was presented in accordance with his instructions” as set out in his affidavit. I pause to observe, however, that in his affidavit, the accused also made many other complaints about the previous lawyers’ conduct of the case and their performance at the trial. The previous lawyers disputed these matters and provided explanations on the approach taken by them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 During the proceedings, the witnesses’ evidence touched on some of the other complaints. This was inevitable as some aspects provided the background and context for the determination of the narrow question. Nonetheless, the parties were agreed that such complaints are beyond the scope of these proceedings. They pertain to the competency of the previous lawyers and the level of assistance they provided at the trial, and fall to be dealt with on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Therefore, as far as possible, the parties sought to confine themselves to the accused’s allegations of failure of the previous lawyers to act in accordance with his instructions. By way of overview, these allegations may broadly be categorised into four areas. These shall be the areas I deal with below.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The accused’s evidence    </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 According to the accused, the previous lawyers did not visit him very often. Mr Retnam interviewed him twice via video-link and went to prison to visit him about five to six times. During one of those visits, Mr Retnam was accompanied by Mr Selvaraj. He did not see Mr GH Singh at all prior to the start of the trial.

He advised the accused that he would be focusing on the main issues, and the accused agreed.

Nevertheless, the previous lawyers proceeded to fully defend the accused on the basis that the accused did not know about the drugs – which was his defence all along.

Therefore, Mr Selvaraj and Mr GH Singh were not able to explain why the written instructions were not carried out; they were not aware of those instructions. During the prison interviews, it was unlikely that the written instructions were discussed. Mr BM Singh submitted that this was because Mr Retnam did not deem it necessary to deal with the written instructions. Mr Retnam had concluded how best to run the case, and did not bother to act on the written instructions as he thought they were unimportant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In relation to the oral instructions regarding the accused’s financial situation, Mr BM Singh submitted that these were clearly not carried out at the trial. There was an absence of attendance notes confirming that the previous lawyers had advised the accused person not to put forth such evidence, and that he had agreed with the advice. Again, it was contended that the failure arose because Mr Retnam considered the instructions to be irrelevant, unimportant and frivolous.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In contending that Mr Retnam ignored the accused’s instructions, Mr BM Singh stated that Mr Retnam failed to consult the accused as he was confident in his own skills as a criminal lawyer. He acted in a paternalistic fashion, making key decisions without the accused’s instructions. Mr BM Singh illustrated this by highlighting two complaints against Mr Retnam’s conduct. First, prior to the trial, Mr Retnam did not furnish the full committal hearing bundle to the accused. Second, Mr Retnam did not consult the accused on the Statement of Agreed Facts. Nonetheless, Mr BM Singh conceded that he should “say no more at this juncture, as we appreciate that these are issues that should more appropriately be ventilated before the Court of Appeal”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As I explained at [11], the parties were in agreement that there are complaints which go beyond the scope of these proceedings. The two matters raised by Mr BM Singh fall within that list. I shall not be making any findings on any of these complaints.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In his written submissions, Mr Edmund Nathan (“Mr Nathan”), counsel for Mr Retnam, submitted that Mr Retnam acted in accordance with the instructions of the accused. The defence centred on the accused’s lack of knowledge of the drugs, and Mr Retnam put forth that defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It was not true that Mr Retnam did not visit the accused often. In fact, it cannot be disputed that Mr Retnam visited the accused at least 11 times. This was an attempt to discredit Mr Retnam, as were the many other allegations made against Mr Retnam. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Mr Nathan pointed out that while the accused denied telling the previous lawyers not to challenge his statements, he referred to his statements throughout the trial. If he had wished to challenge the voluntariness of his statements, he would not have relied on them at the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Further, it was not true that Mr Retnam had ignored the written instructions. Relying on the contents of the notes dated 21 May 2015, Mr Retnam had made detailed representations to the Prosecution dated 27 June 2015, asking for the charge against the accused to be withdrawn.

Also, the previous lawyers have denied the claims, and their evidence was corroborated by the previous lawyers’ attendance notes and the documentary evidence. Further, as observed in the GD, the accused was not a credible witness. At this juncture, he was merely seeking to blame the previous lawyers. The Prosecution urged the court to find that the previous lawyers did not fail to present the accused’ case at trial in accordance with his instructions.

In respect of the prison visit on 29 December 2015 by Mr Retnam and Mr Selvaraj, the attendance notes recorded that they told him that “since he had made his statements voluntarily and the police had not threatened, used physical force when recording his statements [they] would not challenge the statements at the trial. <span class="font-italic">He agreed</span><span class="font-italic">.</span>”[emphasis added].

</div> The accused was not able to dispute the accuracy of the contemporaneous record, and I give full weight to the 29 December 2015 attendance notes.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I appreciate that the accused had voiced some concerns about the statement recording process in the notes dated 21 May 2015 and 15 October 2015. In my view, it would be quite wrong to elevate each and every assertion made by the accused in the notes to the status of an “express instruction” of the approach to be taken at the trial. Furnished in the early stages of the preparation of the case, the notes contained the accused’s narration of the events and his responses to the contents of the statements. From a perusal of the notes, I find it hard put to say that any firm instruction had been given to object to the admissibility of the statements on the ground of voluntariness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any event, it was for the previous lawyers to assess the information, to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the assertions put forth by the accused, to advise the accused on the merits of his assertions and to agree on the position to be taken at the trial. It appears to me that the previous lawyers did just that. As Mr Retnam testified, he told the accused that mere “excuses” would not suffice in court, and there had to be “really some evidence” of threat, inducement or promise. Mr Selvaraj shared the view that there was no basis to mount a challenge on the ground of voluntariness. In fact, as Mr Retnam testified, he would have had no difficulty carrying out such an instruction, if required. He pointed out that at the trial, he had sought (albeit unsuccessfully) to expunge portions of the statements relating to the previous drug transactions involving the accused, on the ground that such matters would be prejudicial to the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Given all of the above, I accept the consistent stance of Mr Retnam and Mr Selvaraj that at the end of the day, the position <span class="font-italic">as agreed </span>with the accused was that there would not be any objection to the admissibility of the statements. I should add that in coming to this position, I have also considered the merits of the accused’s allegations about the statement recording process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Admittedly, these allegations were not tested at the trial. Nonetheless, they are hardly strong allegations. The particulars of inducement are weak. There are no details as to how the accused’s will was “sapped” in relation to the recording of the statements. Instead, the accused only said he was forced to sign on a document relating to a polygraph test. I was also perturbed by the fact that in cross-examination in these proceedings, the accused conceded that he did not comprehend the word “sapped”, and that it was included in his notes because a fellow prison inmate had suggested it.

</div>
</div> I see little basis for a challenge on the ground of voluntariness. The evidential weakness in these allegations lent credence to the previous lawyers’ explanation that they had advised the accused against challenging the statements and eventually obtained the accused’s agreement on the approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In sum, I reject the accused’s allegation that the previous lawyers failed to adhere to his instructions by failing to challenge the admissibility of the statements. I find that it is not a credible claim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged failure to present evidence that the accused was not in financial difficulties, and to dispute portions of his statement which state that he was in financial difficulties  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I move to the second allegation. According to the accused, contrary to the written and oral instructions, the previous lawyers failed to present evidence of the accused’s sound financial position, and to dispute the portions of his statement relating to his financial difficulties. Such aspects would go towards showing that the accused had no reason at all to bring drugs into Singapore. Once again, I reject the accused’s contention for the following reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 It is true that in the notes dated 15 October 2015, the accused mentioned that he did not sell the bus due to financial difficulties, that he did not work for Siva and that Sarr borrowed only a sum of RM6,000 from him and not RM12,000. While the accused had made such assertions, it remained for the previous lawyers to assess their merits, and for parties to agree on the stance to be adopted at the trial. Once again, I rely on my reasoning at [55]–[56] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this connection, Mr Retnam stated that the agreement with the accused was that they would focus on the crux of the defence – being the accused’s knowledge of the contents of the plastic bag. That was his “sole defence”, according to Mr Selvaraj. They confirmed that it was <span class="font-italic">not </span>the accused’s instruction that he need not resort to bringing drugs into Singapore because he was financially sound. In particular, Mr Retnam and Mr Selvaraj stated that during the prison visits, the accused did not brief them on his financial circumstances at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Further, as Mr Retnam explained, Dr Koh’s psychiatric report revealed that the accused provided an account of his financial difficulties which was consistent with the portions of his statement. By raising this issue, there was a risk of damaging the credibility of the accused. Mr Selvaraj expressed a similar concern. In his written submissions, Mr Selvaraj pointed out that in the psychiatric report, Dr Koh also reported that the accused’s wife “corroborated his account of his business problems”.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Given the consistent position of Mr Retnam and Mr Selvaraj, I accept that there was an agreement for the previous lawyers to focus on the defence of knowledge of the contents of the plastic bag. I also accept that the accused did not instruct the previous lawyers that he need not traffic in drugs because he was financially sound. In fact, this was supported by the accused’s evidence which I discuss at [65] below. Moreover, the accused’s financial difficulties were confirmed by the contents of the psychiatric report. Disputing the portions of the statement carried some risk. To my mind, in not dealing with this area, the previous lawyers acted in accordance with the agreed approach to focus on the material aspects of the defence. They did not depart from the accused’s instructions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In contrast, the accused’s allegation is questionable. If he had been concerned about the impact of his financial position, apart from informing Mr Retnam as he claimed (see [16(b)(ii)] above), he would have specifically raised the issue with Mr Selvaraj. Also, he would have mentioned the notes to Mr Selvaraj. Instead, Mr Selvaraj stated that there was no mention of the notes during the interviews. It was especially telling that in cross-examination, the accused admitted that he did not tell Mr Retnam or Mr Selvaraj that he wanted his financial status to be an important part of his defence.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Further, on the accused’s claim that Rani handed Mr Retnam the three log books of the business, Mr Retnam denied this. Mr Selvaraj said that there was no mention of the three log books by the accused to him. According to the accused, Rani has not been willing to testify for the accused, to explain what happened to the three log books. As such, the accused was simply not able to substantiate his claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I also wish to add that in the GD, I merely referred to the fact that in his statement, the accused said he was facing financial difficulties: see [25(a)] of the GD. In arriving at my decision to convict the accused, I did not rely on the evidence that he was in financial difficulties. The evidence in this area would not have any effect on my verdict.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged failure to challenge other aspects of his statements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The next allegation is that contrary to the accused’s written instructions, two key aspects of the statements were not challenged. Relying on the notes dated 15 October 2015, the accused claimed that he instructed Mr Retnam to dispute the accuracy of the portion in his contemporaneous statement where he mentioned that there were three bundles in the plastic bag. He only saw the three bundles <span class="font-italic">after </span>the plastic bag was placed in the bus (“the first point”). Also, he instructed Mr Retnam to dispute the fact that he said that “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” meant something illegal (“the second point”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 To reiterate, according to Mr Retnam, the areas did not go to the crux of the defence. The agreed position was that they would not challenge portions of his statements which were irrelevant to the defence. As for Mr Selvaraj, he did not receive the notes dated 15 October 2015, and he was not able to comment on these matters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In relation to these two points raised by the accused, there is no contemporaneous record of the specific approach to be taken at the trial. Nonetheless, given that lengthy statements of the accused were to be used at the trial, I accept Mr Retnam’s position that he advised the accused not to challenge portions of the statements irrelevant to the defence, and that the accused agreed to this general approach. This was also in line with the agreement to focus on the material aspects of the defence: see [64] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Turning to the first point, I accept Mr Retnam’s evidence that it was a minor and irrelevant point which he did not pursue. In the contemporaneous statement, it was recorded that “[t]there are 3 packages. I’m not sure what is inside it.” There was no mention of <span class="font-italic">when </span>the accused discovered that there were three bundles – and there was no reason to clarify that he specifically found out that there were three bundles only after the plastic bag was placed in the bus. In not dealing with the first point, Mr Retnam acted in accordance with the general approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As for the second point, I am of the view that it is closely connected to the accused’s defence that he did not know that the plastic bag contained drugs. The second point – that the statement inaccurately reflected that the accused knew that “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” was something illegal – is not irrelevant. Under the general approach, Mr Retnam was meant to pursue matters going to the root of the defence. Dealing with the second point would have been one such matter. Thus, it would have been in order for Mr Retnam to cross-examine the recording officer and the interpreter on the statement recording process, and to dispute whether they accurately recorded the point in para 28 of Exh P134. It would also have been in order for Mr Retnam to adduce evidence from the accused on this matter. Mr Retnam did not do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 That said, I am of the view that this failure would have no effect on the verdict. Quite apart from the admission in the statement that the accused knew that “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” was something illegal, there was overwhelming evidence to show that he knew he was delivering <span class="font-italic">illegal </span>items for Siva, and that the plastic bag contained something illegal. I elaborate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In the statements, the accused stated that he delivered “<span class="font-italic">makan</span>” or “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” or “<span class="font-italic">air </span><span class="font-italic">batu</span>” for Siva. At para 8 of Exh P130, he said that “<span class="font-italic">makan</span>” would have meant something illegal. At the trial, under cross-examination by the Prosecution, he also accepted that “<span class="font-italic">makan</span>” would have meant something illegal.

</div> While he claimed that he only knew that “<span class="font-italic">air </span><span class="font-italic">batu</span>” was “ice cubes”, and not methamphetamine, I had found this assertion to be unbelievable: see [43] of the GD. Given that “<span class="font-italic">barang</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>, “<span class="font-italic">makan</span>” and “<span class="font-italic">air </span><span class="font-italic">batu</span>” were being delivered for the same person Siva, and that he knew the latter two were illegal items, it was untenable for the accused to claim that he thought the “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” which he conveyed for Siva was something legal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In fact, at the trial, the accused had attempted to disavow the portion of his statement claiming that “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” referred to illegal items. Under cross-examination by the previous lawyer for the co-accused, the accused claimed that he told the investigation officer that “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” and “<span class="font-italic">makan</span>” referred to something legal. Under cross-examination by the Prosecution, when confronted with para 28 of Exh P134 which stated that he knew “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” referred to something illegal, he said he “agree[d] with” and “accept[ed]” the statement. In the same breath, the accused claimed that he was stressed. An adjournment was granted for him to compose himself. After the adjournment, the accused replied “[w]hat transpired today about paragraph 28, I accept”.

</div>
</div> As I mentioned in the preceding paragraph, he also admitted that “<span class="font-italic">makan</span>” would have meant something illegal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 At [45] of the GD, I discussed in some detail the accused’s attempts to disassociate himself from this unfavourable aspect of his statement. While I noted that Mr Retnam did not cross-examine the relevant Prosecution witnesses, I also emphasised that eventually, the accused conceded that his statement had been accurately recorded. As such, I had rejected the claim that he thought “<span class="font-italic">barang</span>” referred to legal items. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Even if the accused were to successfully challenge the portion of his statement stating that “<span class="font-italic">barang</span><span class="font-italic">” </span>referred to something illegal, the question would be what he thought the “<span class="font-italic">barang</span><span class="font-italic">” </span>he delivered for Siva was. If the accused did not think he was delivering anything illegal, it remained the case that he had not positively asserted what he thought the plastic bag contained. The fact remains that he was delivering illegal items which he referred to as “<span class="font-italic">makan</span>” and methamphetamine which he referred to as “<span class="font-italic">air </span><span class="font-italic">batu</span>”. Given all the facts and circumstances, as I found from [46]–[49] of the GD, he ought to have been – and must have been – highly suspicious of the contents of the plastic bag. He had the opportunity to check its contents or enquire about the contents from Siva but did not do so. Thus, this entire area of evidence at these proceedings would not, in my view, change my finding that he had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge within s 18(2) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged failure to raise a full defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I will deal with the last allegation briefly. It is clearly untrue that the previous lawyers ran a partial defence that the accused was merely a courier. At all times, the defence raised was that the accused did not know that the plastic bag contained drugs. Therefore, this allegation is completely without merit. In any case, Mr BM Singh did not rely on this in the written submissions.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 To sum up, I find that the previous lawyers, particularly Mr Retnam, presented the accused’s case in accordance with the instructions of the accused, save for one limited aspect. The accused has failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Turning to the limited aspect, it is in relation to the failure to dispute the accuracy of para 28 of Exh P134, where it is recorded that the accused said “<span class="font-italic">[</span><span class="font-italic">b]arang</span> to me is something which is illegal”. This point is closely connected to the defence. Given the accused’s denial of this point in his notes dated 15 October 2015, and the instruction for Mr Retnam to deal with points material to the defence, Mr Retnam should have disputed the accuracy of this portion of the statement. This was not carried out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 That said, for the reasons set out at [73]–[77] above, the failure to deal with this point would not have any effect on my verdict. For the avoidance of doubt, the additional evidence in these proceedings covering the other areas would have no effect on my verdict.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I should add that I agree with the Prosecution that the accused is now seeking to blame the previous lawyers for <span class="font-italic">substantially</span> failing to act in accordance with his instructions in order to strengthen his chances of getting out of his present predicament. There is no merit to the complaint that his instructions were ignored.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Before I conclude, I make two comments. First, it would have been good practice for Mr Retnam to have shared the notes with Mr Selvaraj and Mr GH Singh, and for attendance notes to be kept of all the interviews with the accused. Second, as for the many other complaints regarding the competency of the previous  lawyers  and  the  level  of  assistance  they  provided  at  the trial, they  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">go beyond the scope of these proceedings.
