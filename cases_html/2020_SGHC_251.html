One cannot have recourse to both<span class="font-italic"> </span>arbitration <span class="font-italic">and</span> the court for the same dispute. It is possible that parties may intend some types of disputes arising from an agreement to be resolved by arbitration and others by litigation in court. Obviously, such clauses need to be very carefully thought through and drafted. The irony is not lost; such dispute resolution clauses tend to lend themselves to dispute over which dispute resolution mechanism should apply. The present case is one such example. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff, Silverlink Resorts Limited, is one of the insured parties under an Industrial All Risks Policy (“the Policy”) issued by the defendant, MS First Capital Insurance Limited. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the plaintiff making a claim under the Policy. The defendant disputed the claim and the plaintiff filed the present Originating Summons, seeking, among other things, a declaration that the plaintiff has a valid claim under the Policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 By Summons No 2633 of 2020 (“SUM 2633”), the defendant applied to stay the proceedings in this Originating Summons in favour of arbitration, pursuant to s 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”).

Clause 13 (the “Jurisdiction Clause”) was expressed to apply to “any dispute … regarding the interpretation or the application of” the Policy. The scope of the jurisdiction clause in the Renewal Certificate (the “Renewal Certificate Jurisdiction Clause”) was similar to that of the Jurisdiction Clause. On the face of the provisions, there was an overlap between the scope of the Arbitration Clauses on the one hand, and the scope of the Jurisdiction Clause and the Renewal Certificate Jurisdiction Clause on the other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I pause to note that the Jurisdiction Clause referred to disputes regarding the “interpretation or the application” of the Policy whereas the Renewal Certificate Jurisdiction Clause referred only to disputes over the “interpretation” of the Policy. I did not think that the omission of the word “application’ in the latter made much difference. After all, the application of the Policy would have to depend on its interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The dispute in these proceedings concerned the question whether the plaintiff had to establish an admissible claim for property damage under Section I of the Policy before a claim may be admitted under Section II for business interruption (“the Dispute”). It was clear that the Dispute could fall within the scope of the Arbitration Clause. However, as it related to the interpretation or application of the Policy, it could also fall within the scope of the Jurisdiction Clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The issue therefore was whether the Arbitration Clause or the Jurisdiction Clause applied to the Dispute. This in turn depended on how the two seemingly conflicting clauses fell to be interpreted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable legal principles </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It is by now well settled that in construing an arbitration clause, the court does not adopt a technical approach but construes it based on the presumed intentions of the parties as rational commercial parties: <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> at [124], citing <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corporation v Privalov</span> [2007] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 267, affirmed by the House of Lords <span class="font-italic">subnom Premium Nafta Products Ltd v Fili Shipping Co Ltd</span> [2008] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span>”). In this regard, parties are presumed to have “intended any dispute arising out of the relationship into which they have entered or purported to enter to be decided by the same tribunal” unless the language shows otherwise: <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust </span>at [13], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Hoffmann.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Courts have thus taken a generous approach in construing arbitration clauses. As the Court of Appeal put it succinctly in <span class="font-italic">Rals International Pte Ltd v Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza SpA </span>[2016] 5 SLR 455 (“<span class="font-italic">Rals</span>”), at [32], “[e]ssentially, the rule of construction is that all disputes between parties are assumed to fall within the scope of the arbitration clause unless shown otherwise”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The operation of this generous approach is clearly demonstrated by the “<span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach”, named after the decision in <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith Ltd v H&amp;S International Holding Inc </span>[1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 127 (“<span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span>”). In that case, the plaintiff sued for unpaid royalties. The licensing agreement provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES  If any dispute or difference shall arise between the parties hereto concerning the construction of this Agreement or the rights or liabilities of either party hereunder the parties shall strive to settle the same amicably but if they are unable to do so the dispute or difference shall be adjudicated upon under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more Arbitrators appointed in accordance with those Rules.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14. LANGUAGE AND LAW  This Agreement is written in the English language and shall be interpreted according to English Law. The Courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction over it to which jurisdiction the parties hereby submit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 On the face of it, the two clauses were inconsistent with each other. The plaintiff argued that the arbitration agreement in cl 13 was not effective as a result of this inconsistency. Steyn J (as he then was) resolved the inconsistency by interpreting cl 14 as applying to the arbitration itself.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Disputes under the agreement therefore fell to be decided by arbitration pursuant to cl 13 whilst the jurisdiction clause (cl 14) was interpreted to mean that it provided for the English courts’ supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration. His Honour was thus able to conclude that both cll 13 and 14 were valid and binding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach has been adopted in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">BXH v BXI </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">BXH</span>”), the agreement contained the following clauses:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25.8 This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Singapore, except for its rules regarding conflicts of laws. The jurisdiction and venue for any legal action between the parties hereto arising out of or connected with this Agreement, or the Services and Products furnished hereunder, shall be in a court located in Singapore. The ‘United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods’ does not apply to this Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25.9 Disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration which shall be held in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules” then in effect….</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The High Court noted (at [243]) that a dispute arising out of the agreement cannot obviously be the subject of both litigation and arbitration, and held as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The only practical – thought [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] not entirely satisfactory – solution is to adopt the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach and hold that the parties intended to resolve substantive disputes in arbitration under cl 25.9 and to resolve disputes arising out of any such arbitration in the Singapore courts in the exercise of their supervisory jurisdiction under cl 25.8.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court, noting that “a generous and harmonious interpretation should be given to the purportedly conflicting clauses so as to give effect to the parties’ true intention” (at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>and <span class="font-italic">BXH</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the arbitration and jurisdiction clauses were, on the face of the clauses, completely at odds with each other and could not co-exist with each other. The <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach gave a generous interpretation to the arbitration clauses by giving them their full effect whilst the jurisdiction clauses were construed to refer to the court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitrations. Such a construction was seen to be preferable to rendering the clauses invalid on the ground that they conflicted with each other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 However, it is not the case that the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach applies whenever an agreement contains an arbitration clause and a jurisdiction clause. As the Court of Appeal pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Rals </span>(at [31]–[32]), there are limits to this generous approach to interpretation and ultimately, it all depends on the intention of the parties, objectively ascertained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Parties to an agreement can decide to have certain types of disputes resolved by arbitration and others by litigation. One obvious reason for doing so is that certain types of disputes may be better suited for arbitration whilst others may be better suited for litigation. <span class="font-italic">Russell on Arbitration </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 24th Ed, 2015)<span class="font-italic"> </span>explains as follows (at para 2.038): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Some contracts provide that particular disputes will be resolved by one form of dispute resolution and other types of dispute by some other method….Some questions of default such as the failure to pay an instalment due, might be more effectively settled by litigation, whose summary procedures have no direct counterparty in arbitration, whilst valuation and/or technical questions in the same contract might be settled more simply by expert determination. Some clauses distinguish between resolving disputes as to liability, which fall within the arbitration agreement, and those as to damages, which do not. The key issue when dealing with such provisions is to ensure that it is clear precisely which types of disputes fall to be resolved by each mechanism….</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 So long as the arbitration and jurisdiction clauses in an agreement evince the intention of the parties to have different disputes resolved by arbitration and litigation, that intention should be respected and given effect to. In such cases, there is also no reason to apply the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach since the arbitration and jurisdiction clauses are not inconsistent with each other; both clauses perform entirely separate functions and are independently enforceable. The key issue in such cases, as pointed out in the above passage, lies in determining the scope of each clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However, in some cases, the arbitration clause may be expressed to apply to all disputes whilst the jurisdiction clause is expressed to apply to certain specific disputes. In such cases, the courts have resolved the apparent inconsistency by interpreting the jurisdiction clause as having carved out the specific disputes from the scope of the arbitration clause. Three cases illustrate this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd v Burgundy Global Exploration Corp </span>[2010] SLR 821 (“<span class="font-italic">Transocean</span>”), the parties entered into an offshore drilling contract containing a condition precedent that both parties enter into an escrow agreement for the opening of an escrow account. The escrow agreement required the defendant to deposit an escrow amount into the escrow account. Failure to deposit the escrow moneys by the stipulated date entitled the plaintiff to terminate the drilling contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Article 25 of the drilling contract contained an arbitration clause, which provided as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25.1 Arbitration</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The following Dispute Resolution provision shall apply to this Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in relation to or in connection with this Contract … shall be exclusively and finally settled by arbitration … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, cl 6.2(a) of the escrow agreement contained a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause, which provided as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to and accepts generally and unconditionally the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts and appellate courts of Singapore with respect to any legal action or proceedings which may be brought at any time relating in any way to this Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The defendant subsequently failed to deposit the escrow moneys and the plaintiff commenced an action claiming, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, damages for the defendant’s breach and/or repudiation of the escrow agreement. The High Court dismissed the defendant’s application for a stay in favour of arbitration for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The parties “had intentionally carved the [escrow agreement] out from the [drilling contract] and expressly subjected the former to a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause rather than an arbitration clause” (at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Although the arbitration clause in the drilling contract referred to disputes arising “in connection with” the drilling contract, it was clear that the arbitration clause was principally concerned with disputes arising out of or in relation to the drilling contract and did not apply to a dispute squarely under the escrow agreement and having at best a tenuous connection with the drilling contract (at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even if the escrow agreement was regarded as an extension of the drilling contract or as one with the latter, the jurisdiction clause in the escrow agreement did not purport to deal with any disputes arising out of the drilling contract. It focussed only on claims arising out of the escrow agreement. The jurisdiction clause (which was specific) overrode the arbitration clause (which was general) as the claim arose out of the escrow agreement (at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Although the arbitration clause and the jurisdiction clause were contained in separate agreements, it is clear that the High Court was of the view that even if the two agreements were regarded as one, the jurisdiction clause had carved out claims arising under the escrow agreement from the arbitration clause (see [37(c)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Seeley International Pty Ltd v Electra Air</span><span class="font-italic"> Conditioning BV </span>[2008] FCA 29 (“<span class="font-italic">Seeley</span>”), an exclusive distribution agreement contained a dispute resolution clause that provided for disputes “between the parties concerning or arising out of this Agreement or its construction, meaning, operation or effect or concerning the rights, duties or liabilities of any party” to be referred to senior management of each party and if they fail to resolve the dispute, to arbitration. However, the clause also provided that “[n]othing in [the clause] prevents a party seeking injunctive or declaratory relief in the case of a material breach or threatened breach of” the agreement. The applicant commenced proceedings claiming declarations concerning the proper construction of the agreement, including a declaration that the respondent was in breach of the agreement. The respondent applied for an order that the proceedings be stayed in favour of arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Federal Court of Australia dismissed the respondent’s stay application. The Court found that the dispute resolution clause had carved out disputes relating to the material or threatened breach of the exclusive distributorship agreement and that the parties’ agreement was to treat such disputes differently from the regime for arbitration (at [31]–[32]). The Court noted (at [31]) that the dispute in question concerned what may be a material breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Court was also of the view (at [37]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it does not flaunt business common sense that the parties, having agreed upon arbitrating their disputes, should nevertheless agree upon an optional alternative dispute resolution process – by way of court proceedings – in certain circumstances. There is no inherent commercial reason why certain disputes where declaratory or injunctive relief is sought should not be agreed to be determined by a court. There is nothing to suggest such resolution would or should be less speedy or less efficacious or more expensive. Particularly where the parties have demonstrated such care in arriving at, and expressing, their bargain, the syntactical and semantic analysis of cl 20 as a whole should not be ignored because it suggests a preserved alternative but limited dispute resolution process by court proceedings. The availability of such access to the courts would not defeat the commercial purpose of the agreement; indeed it may serve it; cf per Kirby J in <span class="font-italic">Corumo Holdings Pty Ltd v C Itoh Ltd </span>(1991) 24 NSWLR 370 at 378. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 <span class="font-italic">Hi-Tech Investments Ltd v World Aviation Systems (Australia) Pty Ltd</span> [2006] NZHC 1228 (“<span class="font-italic">Hi-Tech</span>”) involved a commercial building lease which provided for rent to be reviewed as at 1 October 2005. In accordance with the rent review mechanism in the lease, on 27 September 2005, the plaintiff (landlord) notified the defendant (tenant) of the new rent from 1 October 2005. The defendant accepted the increased rent and paid the new rent from 1 October 2005. However, in November 2005 and March 2006, the plaintiff claimed increases in rent in respect of two parts of the premises. The defendant disputed the further increases in rent on the basis that the rent review process had concluded with the defendant’s acceptance of the increased rent in the 27 September 2005 notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The lease contained the following clauses:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44.1 UNLESS any dispute or difference is resolved by mediation or other agreement, the same shall be submitted to the arbitration of one arbitrator who shall conduct the arbitral proceedings in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1996 and any amendment thereof or any other statutory provision then relating to arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44.3 The procedures prescribed in this clause shall not prevent the landlord from taking proceedings for the recovery of any rent or other monies payable hereunder which remain unpaid or from exercising the rights and remedies in the event of such default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The High Court of New Zealand observed (at [15]) that there was “no question that it was open to the parties to agree that some disputes will be resolved by arbitration to the exclusion of the Courts, but that others can be resolved in Courts”. The Court agreed with the parties (at [16]) that cl 44 was such a hybrid dispute resolution clause. The specific point in dispute in that case was whether cl 44.3 exempted from arbitration all disputes arising on a claim for rent (or other monies payable under the lease) including a determination of what the liability may be. The Court concluded (at [24]) that the jurisdiction clause allowed court proceedings for recovery of rent or other monies for which liability has been established under the lease or (if necessary) by arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Transocean</span>, <span class="font-italic">Seeley</span> and <span class="font-italic">Hi-Tech</span>, the courts resolved the apparent inconsistencies between the jurisdiction and arbitration clauses by giving an interpretation  that favoured the jurisdiction clauses. The <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach (which would have given an interpretation in favour of the arbitration clause) was not applied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I respectfully agree with the carve out approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Transocean</span>, <span class="font-italic">Seeley</span> and <span class="font-italic">Hi-Tech</span>; it gave effect to the intention of the parties. The jurisdiction clauses in these cases covered specific types of disputes only and were thus narrower in scope than the arbitration clauses. As pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Trans</span><span class="font-italic">ocean </span>(at [25]), it is a rule of construction that the general should give way to the specific. The jurisdiction clauses evinced the parties’ intention to carve out the specific disputes from the arbitration clauses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further, in my view, where the jurisdiction clause covers specific disputes only, the carve out approach makes sound commercial sense. Applying the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach to such cases would result in the jurisdiction clause being interpreted to mean that it provides for the court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration in so far as it <span class="font-italic">relates to the specific disputes that fall within the scope of the jurisdiction clause</span>. The question that then arises is which courts would have supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration with respect to disputes that do not fall within the jurisdiction clause?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Absent agreement between the parties, the seat of arbitration will be determined by the arbitral tribunal and the seat will determine the jurisdiction whose courts would exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration. This means that applying the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach could result in the arbitration being subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of different courts depending on whether the issue in dispute falls within the jurisdiction clause or not. The problem would be exacerbated where the arbitration (as it is likely to) involves disputes which fall within the jurisdiction clause as well as disputes which do not. In my view, the parties could not have intended such a chaotic result. It would also be inconsistent with the <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust </span>presumption that parties intend their disputes to be decided by the same tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applying the legal principles to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The defendant submitted that the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach should be applied to give the Jurisdiction Clause a harmonious interpretation, such that the Jurisdiction Clause is interpreted<span class="font-italic"> </span>as providing for the Court’s supervisory jurisdiction over arbitrations conducted pursuant to the Arbitration Clause. On the other hand, the plaintiff argued that the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach was not relevant because the Jurisdiction Clause carved out disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Policy from the scope of the Arbitration Clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50  <span class="font-italic"> </span>It bears reminding that this analytical exercise was all about ascertaining the intention of the parties. The question to be answered was whether the parties’ intention, objectively ascertained, was for the Jurisdiction Clause to carve out disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Policy, from the Arbitration Clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The defendant submitted that the parties could not have intended the Jurisdiction Clause to carve out disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the Policy, from the Arbitration Clause. The defendant argued that this was commercially illogical because it would leave the Arbitration Clause with a very narrow scope. I disagreed with the defendant. The scope of the Jurisdiction Clause did not reduce the scope of the Arbitration Clause to such an extent as would lead to the conclusion that the parties could not have intended the result. As the plaintiff pointed out, the Jurisdiction Clause would not apply to disputes relating to, for example, the quantum of loss or the validity of the Policy (including disputes over whether there has been failure to give full and frank disclosure). Such disputes would fall to be dealt with under the Arbitration Clause if mediation failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The defendant next referred to the fact that the Arbitration Clause provided that “the parties shall unless otherwise mutually agreed, use the best practice within the jurisdiction of this Policy to <span class="font-italic">have the dispute arbitrated before legal action is commenced</span>” [emphasis added]. The defendant argued that the language used showed that the parties clearly agreed to go to court only after their dispute had been arbitrated. The clause seemed somewhat clumsily drafted in this regard but the expression “before legal action is commenced” could only have meant going to court to invoke its supervisory jurisdiction. It could not have meant commencing legal action over the same dispute that had already been adjudicated upon by arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I agreed with the plaintiff that this argument did not support the defendant’s case. If the Arbitration Clause had already provided for the court’s supervisory jurisdiction, then Jurisdiction Clause would be superfluous if it merely referred to the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. This supported the plaintiff’s case that the Jurisdiction Clause was not intended to refer only to the court’s supervisory role. In construing agreements, the court should strive to give effect to all clauses in a contract: <span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd and another v State Bank of India and others</span> [2019] SGHC 292 at [146].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The defendant also submitted that the Mediation Clause and the Arbitration Clause showed the parties’ intention to resolve disputes through a multi-tiered dispute resolution mechanism. In my view, this submission did not take the defendant’s case any further. The question remained whether the parties intended the Jurisdiction Clause to carve out disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Policy, from the Arbitration Clause (which formed a part of the multi-tiered dispute resolution mechanism). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I saw no reason why the carve out approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Transocean</span>, <span class="font-italic">Seeley</span> and <span class="font-italic">Hi-Tech</span> should not be applied to the present case.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In my judgment, the parties’ intention, objectively ascertained, was for the Jurisdiction Clause to carve out disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Policy from the scope of the Arbitration Clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, the Jurisdiction Clause did not apply to all disputes; its scope was clearly narrower than that of the Arbitration Clause. The defendant did not contend otherwise. That pointed to the parties’ intention being to carve out the specific disputes in the Jurisdiction Clause from the Arbitration Clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Second, I agreed with the plaintiff that the Renewal Certificate Jurisdiction Clause confirmed the parties’ intention that disputes relating to the interpretation of the Policy were to be resolved through court proceedings rather than arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Third, I also agreed with the plaintiff that reserving disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the Policy to be decided by the court made commercial sense because such disputes may be resolved effectively, efficaciously and efficiently through the originating summons procedure. This supported the plaintiff’s contention that the Jurisdiction Clause was intended to carve out such disputes from the Arbitration Clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Fourth, applying the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>approach in the present case would lead to the problems discussed at [47]–[48] above. The parties could not have intended those consequences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I would add that the plaintiff had also submitted that even if the Jurisdiction Clause was inconsistent with the Arbitration Clause, the Renewal Certificate prevailed over the General Conditions, including the Arbitration Clause. I disagreed with this submission. There was nothing in the Renewal Certificate that warranted such a conclusion. At most, the Renewal Certificate Jurisdiction Clause would have merely amended the Jurisdiction Clause by making submission to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Singapore mandatory instead of being at the option of the insured party (as was the case under the Jurisdiction Clause). However, this did not change the analysis above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In conclusion, the Jurisdiction Clause carved out disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Policy from the scope of the Arbitration Clause. Accordingly, the Dispute did not fall within the scope of the Arbitration Clause and the defendant was therefore not entitled to an order to stay these proceedings in favour of arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I therefore dismissed the defendant’s appeal. I also ordered that the defendant pay to the plaintiff, the costs of the appeal fixed at $6,000 plus disbursements, to be fixed by me if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"><br/>Nair Suresh Sukumara and Yeow Guan Wei, Joel (PK Wong &amp; Nair LLC) for the plaintiff; <br/>Lok Vi Ming <span class="font-italic">SC, </span>Lee Sien Liang, Joseph, Pak Waltan and Qabir Singh Sandhu (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
