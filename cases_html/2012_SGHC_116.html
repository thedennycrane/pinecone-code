<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties to the present application were
                    co-respondents in a Singapore arbitration. The claimant in the arbitration, [C],
                    belongs to a group of private equity funds. The arbitration concerned a dispute
                    surrounding a shareholders’ agreement between AZV and [C], entered into in
                    1999, in respect of their shareholding in a company in Korea, [D].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In October 2003, one of the companies in the AZT
                    group (collectively “AZT”) acquired a 51% stake in AZV.
                    Subsequently, in November 2003, AZV and [C] entered into a share purchase
                    agreement whereby AZV bought out [C]’s stake in [D].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 2008, [C] commenced the Singapore arbitration
                    claiming breach of both the 1999 shareholders’ agreement and the 2003
                    share purchase agreement, and seeking to void the sale of its shares to AZV.
                    While AZT (as majority shareholder of AZV) was not party to the arbitration
                    agreement between [C] and AZV, it agreed to be joined as
                co-respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The arbitral award found in favour of [C], with
                    AZT and AZV being jointly and severally liable for damages and costs. The award,
                    however, did not apportion liability as between AZT and AZV, as it was not part
                    of the Terms of Reference of the arbitration. On 20 February 2012, AZT, by
                    an Accord Agreement with [C], agreed to pay [C] $65m in full satisfaction of the
                    arbitral award. AZT now seeks contribution from AZV in the present Originating
                    Summons (“OS”) action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Present application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       AZT is seeking to seal the court documents in
                    the present OS action, the affidavit in support of which has not been filed in
                    light of the present application. It points out that the following matters
                    canvassed in the Singapore arbitration will have to be ventilated in the OS
                    action:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The arbitration
                    award;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        transcripts of the arbitration hearing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Written submissions tendered in the
                        arbitration;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        Terms of Reference; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     The 1999 shareholders’ agreement and the 2003 share
                        purchase agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Accord Agreement would also have
                    to be disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Accordingly, AZT argues that the court documents
                    should be sealed in order to preserve the confidentiality of the arbitration
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This judgment addresses the following issue:
                    whether AZT’s application for the sealing of court documents, so as to
                    preserve the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings the parties were
                    involved in, should be granted?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The need for open justice must be weighed against the need to
                preserve the confidentiality of the arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The principle that the courts must administer
                    justice publicly is well settled in the common law: <em>Scott v
                        Scott</em> [1913] 1 AC 417 (“<em>Scott</em>”). In Jeremy Bentham’s words (quoted by Lord
                    Shaw of Dunfermline in <em>Scott</em> at 477):
                    “Publicity is the very soul of justice. ... It keeps the judge himself
                    while trying under trial”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       This principle, however, is subject to
                    exceptions. The exceptions reflect the “yet more fundamental principle
                    that the chief object of Courts of justice must be to secure that justice is
                    done” (see judgment of Viscount Haldane LC in <em>Scott</em> at 437–438). Consistently with this view that there
                    is a more fundamental principle that prevails over that of open justice,
                        <em>ie</em>, that the chief object of courts of justice
                    is to ensure that justice is done, the principle of publicity must yield in the
                    appropriate cases where to sit in public would destroy the subject matter of the
                    dispute (see <em>Re JN Taylor Holdings Ltd (in
                        liquidation)</em> [2007] SASC 193 at [6], applying numerous English decisions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     
          <em>Department of Economics,
                        Policy and Development of the City of Moscow v Bankers Trust Co</em>
                    [2005] QB 207 (“<em>Moscow</em>”) was a case
                    in which the defendant (London Bankers Trust Co) succeeded in arbitration
                    against another claimant but failed against the plaintiff (the Moscow
                    government). The arbitral award was published only to the parties. London
                    Bankers Trust Co’s application to the English court to set aside the
                    arbitral award was dismissed. In light of the dismissal by the English court of
                    the application to set aside the arbitral award, the Moscow government sought
                    publication of the judgment to demonstrate to the international financial
                    community that the arbitral award, holding that it had not committed any
                    financial default, had been the subject of detailed scrutiny by the English
                    courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mance LJ said, at [32] of his judgment, in
                    relation to the English position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    The rule makers clearly deduced from the principles
                            of the Arbitration Act 1996 that any court hearing should take place, so
                            far as possible, without undermining the reasons of, inter alia, privacy
                            and confidentiality for which parties choose to arbitrate in England.
                            Their conclusion in this regard has not been challenged. It may be
                            justified on the simple basis that arbitration represents a special
                            case, in relation to which there has been very considerable development
                            during recent years. An alternative and overlapping consideration is
                            that parties may be deterred from arbitrating or at any rate from
                            invoking the court’s supervisory role in relation to arbitration
                            if their understanding regarding arbitral confidentiality is ignored.
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     However, Mance LJ was also quick to caution at
                    [40] and [41] that it is ultimately a matter of balance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    The factors militating in favour of publicity have
                            to be weighed together with the desirability of preserving the
                            confidentiality of the original arbitration and its subject matter.
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    ... The limited but necessary interface between
                            arbitration and the public court means that more cannot be expected.
                            There can be no question of withholding publication of reasoned
                            judgments on a blanket basis out of a generalised, and in my view
                            unfounded, concern that their publication would upset the confidence of
                            the business community in English arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It should also be noted that the discussions in <em>Moscow</em> pertained to the publication of judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In Singapore, the High Court (per Chan Seng
                    Onn J) had in <em>AAY v AAZ</em> [2011] 1 SLR 1093
                        (“<em>AAY</em>”) affirmed that
                    confidentiality in arbitration is accepted as a general principle. Furthermore,
                    ss 22 and 23 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“IAA”) reflect the public policy of keeping arbitrations, and all
                    proceedings related to arbitration, confidential. Sections 22 and 23 of the IAA
                    state:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Notwithstanding
                            subsection (3), where a court gives grounds of decision for a judgment
                            in respect of proceedings to which this section applies and considers

                            publications but, if any party to the proceedings reasonably wishes to
                            conceal any matter, including the fact that he was such a party, the
                            court shall —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    give directions

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    if it considers
                                that a report published in accordance with directions given under

                                direct that no report shall be published until after the end of such
                                period, not exceeding 10 years, as it considers
                            appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Thus, in deciding whether to seal the court
                    documents in the present case, the principle of open justice must be weighed
                    against the need to preserve confidentiality in arbitration, with the latter
                    being an important factor in the court’s exercise of discretion (see
                        <em>AAY</em> at [53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In my view, the following factors militate in
                    favour of allowing the application for sealing of the court files:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Both AZT and AZV were party to the
                        arbitration. The confidentiality of the arbitration should not be
                        compromised by the present proceedings between the
                    parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     Having
                        perused the documents, there is nothing to indicate that there is a
                        legitimate public interest in not sealing the court
                    documents;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     While
                        AZV had earlier been recorded as opposing the sealing application, it
                        subsequently clarified that since it is reserving the right to apply to stay
                        the OS action on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction, it neither
                        opposes nor consents to the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In addition, in <em>R v Legal
                        Aid Board Ex p Kaim </em><em>Todner</em> [1999]
                    QB 966, the English Court of Appeal, in discussing exceptions to the general
                    principle of open justice, stated at 978:</p>

                            protection from disclosure of the proceedings it is appropriate to take
                            into account the extent of the interference with the general rule which
                            is involved. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    The nature of the proceedings is also relevant. If
                            the application relates to an interlocutory application this is a less
                            significant intrusion into the general rule than interfering with the
                            public nature of the trial. Interlocutory hearings are normally of no
                            interest to anyone other than the parties. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     While the present OS action is not an
                    interlocutory application, it is a chambers proceeding which is heard
                    “otherwise than in open court” pursuant to s 22 of the IAA:
                    the sealing of court documents would thus be “a less significant
                    intrusion” into the principle of open justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No legitimate public interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It should also be pointed out that many of the
                    relevant authorities dealt with judgments and the need to make judgments dealing
                    with challenges to arbitral awards public. For instance, in <em>AAY v AAZ</em> [2011] 2 SLR 528 (“<em>AAY
                        2</em>”) at [28], the court found that there was legitimate
                    public interest in making the judgment in <em>AAY</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> <em>supra</em>) public, albeit with appropriate redaction,
                    as the judgment discussed the latest jurisprudence on the issue of
                    confidentiality in arbitration. The sealing of court documents, however, would
                    not stifle the development of arbitration jurisprudence in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Neither is there any legitimate public
                    interest in the subject matter of the dispute. Having examined the affidavit in
                    question, it is evident that the dispute between the parties is purely
                    commercial, with nothing to suggest that there is any countervailing and
                    legitimate public interest weighing in favour of disclosure. Accordingly, there
                    is no reason to compromise the confidentiality of the arbitration and related
                    proceedings which had been bargained for and/or agreed to by the
                parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For the foregoing reasons, I allow the
                    plaintiff’s application. No order as to costs.</p>
