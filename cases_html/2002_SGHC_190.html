<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        Items in Row 1 to 5 are

contained in Annex B to the first charge as goods sold to Anthony. The remaining items,

listed in rows 6-11 are contained in Annex B to the second charge as goods sold to

"Johan".</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Background facts</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        The brief background facts

are that the appellant is a Singaporean PR, originally from Hong Kong. He was employed by

Philips Electronics Singapore Pte Ltd ("the Company") in 1998 as the Regional

Service Logistics Manager of Philips Consumer Communications Service ("PCC"). In

March 2000, the appellant was additionally appointed as Accessories Sales and Marketing

Manager, PCC. Donald Puah Boon Leng ("Donald"), aged 36, was the Service

Delivery Manager of PCC , responsible for overseeing field data operations. He and the

appellant came into frequent contact during the course of work.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        The appellant was

responsible for logistic management of service in the Asia Pacific region. This included

the requisitioning of inventories for either stock support to service centres in the

region or quality assurance testing. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        The procedure for drawing

inventories is that PCC would need to requisition it from JSI Shipping Pte Ltd

("JSI"), a third party logistics provider for the Company. Any PCC staff could

initiate the requisition from JSI by giving them a requisition form. When JSI received a

requisition form, it would send or fax a Picking List to the requestor for confirmation.

Upon return of a signed Picking List by the requestor, JSI would then arrange delivery of

the goods. A PCC staff who received the goods had to acknowledge receipt on a delivery

order ("DO") provided by the JSI’s forwarder. PCC employees in the service

logistics department reported to the appellant and each of them could requisition for

goods from JSI.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        All the stocks in

JSI’s warehouse are goods belonging to the Company, which were under the eventual

management responsibility of the appellant, within the scope of his job as Regional

Service Logistics Manager. Equally, goods moved from JSI to PCC would also come under the

management responsibility of the appellant, since they came under the management control

of the appellant’s department. Besides the appellant, another person responsible for

the goods was one MC Wong ("Wong"), to whom he reported and who had the overall

responsibility for service in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Prosecution’s version </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        I now move to the

transactions which are the subject matter of the charges faced by the appellant. Sometime

between 1 to 6 May 2000, the appellant had approached Donald in the office and asked him

to find buyers for some transceivers and handphone accessories. The appellant said that

the goods were ready in JSI and that they were not in the inventory records. Donald and

the appellant agreed to split the proceeds of the sale equally.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        From 7 to 13 May 2000,

Donald agreed with two persons – Anthony Chia Kin Boon ("Anthony"), who had

met him while working with Motorola, and ‘Johan’, an Indonesian businessman who

had met Donald when Donald went there for a business trip, to sell them the items as laid

out in Annex B.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        The price and quantities

were agreed after Donald had consulted with the appellant. Anthony agreed to pay $173,500

and ‘Johan’ agreed to pay $26,500.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        Thereafter, Donald was

instructed by the appellant to liase with one Agnes Yup Mei Li ("Agnes"), an

employee in PCC who worked under the appellant, regarding the transfer of the needed

quantities of items to PCC from JSI. Donald also got one Teo Eng Chye ("Teo"),

who was employed as an engineering assistant in PCC and reported to Donald, to count and

pack the items into smaller cartons and prepare corresponding delivery orders. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        Between 8 May to 17 May

2000, Agnes requisitioned large quantities of transceivers and accessories from JSI on the

instructions of the appellant. An email dated 8 May 2000 was sent to JSI requesting for 20

transceivers each of Genie, Xenium 15, Xenium 16 and Savvy to be delivered daily from 8

May to 12 May 2000, making a total of 80 transceivers in all. A copy of this mail was sent

to the appellant. In addition, she also requested another 100 each of the transceivers

listed above, making a total of 400 transceivers in all.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        Similarly, Agnes sent

another email dated 12 May 2000 requesting 100 transceivers each of Genie, Xenium 15,

Xenium 16 and Savvy. Added to her earlier requests, that made 800 transceivers in all

requested from JSI. All the transceivers were delivered by 12 May 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        Agnes also requested for

accessories such as chargers, batteries and user manuals on four separate occasions –

11, 12, 15 and 17 May 2000 via emails. As before, four picking lists were signed by her,

and she acknowledged receipt of the items by signing the delivery orders, save for the

last delivery order dated 16 May 2000 which was signed by one Fu Yock Buay@Fu XueMei

("Charmaine") on her behalf. Not all accessories ordered were delivered.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        When the requested

transceivers and accessories arrived, Agnes informed the appellant and was told by him to

hand them over to Donald, who in turn requested that she pass them to Teo for unpacking. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        On 17 May 2000, Donald

contacted Anthony and asked him to proceed to the Company to collect the items. A Delivery

Order dated 17 May 2000 was prepared by Teo. The DO was to allow Anthony to be able to

transport the goods out of the Company. The goods taken were the property of the Company.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        The items were taken out

by Anthony’s assistant. That evening, Donald met Anthony to sort out the

discrepancies between what Anthony had brought out and what he had ordered. Donald

testified that he had earlier removed quantities of some of the ordered items from the

Company, thus he was able to make up the shortfalls. After settling matters with Anthony,

Donald then delivered the items ordered by "Johan" to a member of his staff that

same night.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        Donald collected the

payment for the goods from ‘Johan’ and Anthony on 21 May 2000 and 22 May 2000

respectively. Both paid him in cash. After receiving payment from ‘Johan’,

Donald put $10,000 into an envelope, being the appellant’s share of the money, on the

same night. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        On 23 May 2000, Donald

passed the envelope to the appellant at about 8.30 am. He noticed the appellant putting

the envelope into his drawer. Later that day, the appellant and Donald were called up for

internal investigations unrelated to the transactions. The appellant was called up in the

morning and did not return to his office until 5 – 6 pm. He packed his things and was

then escorted out of the office. Donald himself was also called up soon after on the same

day and both he and the appellant were subsequently suspended from their duties.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        On 24 May 2000, before he

left for work in the morning, one Alvin Lim Eng Boon ("Alvin"), a former

employee of PCC, received a call from the appellant. The appellant asked Alvin to help him

retrieve an important document from the drawer of his desk in his office. He also asked

Alvin to get the key from one Ekajanty Alamsjah ("Eka"), an employee in the

logistics department, or Teo since his door was locked. The appellant mentioned that he

and Donald had been suspended.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        Shortly after, Alvin

received a call from Donald asking him to meet Donald at the carpark of Toa Payoh Driving

Range after retrieval of the document.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        On arrival at the office,

Alvin told Teo that he needed to retrieve something from the appellant’s office and

asked Teo for the key, which Teo could not provide. He then got the key from Eka. Alvin

went into the room and retrieved the envelope. He told Eka that he was meeting Donald, and

returned the key to her. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        While driving to meet

Donald, Alvin opened the envelope and found a thick stack of $1,000 notes. He resealed the

envelope and then passed it to Donald at Toa Payoh. He did not discuss the incident again

after that day with anyone.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        Subsequently, on 24

November 2000, the appellant called Alvin and asked him not to tell the Commercial Affairs

Department (CAD) that he saw cash in the envelope. Alvin refused. He received a few more

calls from the appellant that morning, but refused to pick it up after one or two times.

Later that evening, the appellant called Alvin again. They subsequently met up at White

Sands, Pasir Ris, where the appellant again asked Alvin not to reveal that Alvin had

retrieved the envelope filled with cash. Alvin refused and left. The appellant was

subsequently charged with the present offences.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Appellant’s version</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        The appellant denied all

involvement in the transaction and disputes many of the facts above. He claimed that he

had relinquished his post as Service Logistics Manager at the relevant time and further

that there was a conspiracy to frame him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        He denied approaching

Donald in the office to suggest that they sell the goods. With regards to the ordering of

goods by Agnes, the appellant denied having ever given her such instructions. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        The appellant claimed no

knowledge of the existence of the envelope in his office. He claimed that he had locked

his drawers on 23 May 2000. He further denied making any calls to Alvin on 24 November

2000. According to him, he had bumped into Alvin on that day in the evening and they had

chatted for a while.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The discrepancy in quantities</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29        I digress here to

highlight a key feature in this case, which is the discrepancy between the quantities of

goods ordered by Agnes and delivered by JSI and the quantities of these goods eventually

sold to Anthony and "Johan". In the proceedings below, this discrepancy was

pointed to repeatedly by counsel for the appellant and it was again raised on appeal as

casting doubt on the prosecution’s version of events.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30        The quantities of certain

items delivered by JSI in response to Agnes’ request did not match what Donald sold

to Anthony and "Johan" in certain cases. Nor did the quantities correspond to

the DO prepared by Teo. This is set out in the table below:</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">31        As can be seen, the

quantities listed in DO were more than what was delivered in some cases and less in

others. The quantities also showed divergence from the amount sold to Anthony and

"Johan" and those ordered by Agnes and delivered by JSI.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32        Neither Donald nor Agnes

were able to explain where the excess goods not ordered by her came from. The differences

in quantities affected the charge fundamentally, since the prosecution evidence proved

only that the appellant was entrusted with dominion <i>over Philips goods stored in JSI</i>.

Hence, at first instance, the prosecution was ordered to amend the charges to reflect the

fact that only the quantities of each item ordered by Agnes could be reflected in the

charge against the appellant. Any other goods in excess of what was ordered by Agnes (in

terms of quantity) sold by Donald to Anthony and "Johan" were deleted from the

particulars of the charge.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Decision of the trial judge</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33        The learned trial judge

made the following findings of fact:</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appellant was the Service Logistics Manager at the time</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34        The trial judge relied in

making this finding on the evidence of both Charmaine and Ng Lu Ping ("Lu

Ping"), who was the Assistant Service Logistics Manager in PCC, who were unequivocal

that the appellant was still the boss in the logistics department and that they still

reported to him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35        The appellant was also

unable to provide any evidence of his relinquishment of position, save for the testimony

of one Linda Tan Leng Leng ("Linda")<font color="#ff0000">,</font> who was not

even an employee of PCC. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appellant was entrusted with dominion over Philips’ goods

stored in JSI</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36        The trial judge relied on

the evidence of Alan Sparks ("Sparks"), the Senior Vice President of PCC, Asia

Pacific to arrive at this finding. Sparks gave evidence to the effect that in his capacity

as Service Logistics Manager, the appellant had eventual responsibility for the goods in

JSI and their movement. She further found that this would fulfil the requirement of

exercise of dominion.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">There was a conspiracy to sell goods belonging to Philips, stored in

JSI, which the appellant abetted </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37        The trial judge found

Donald’s version of the events to be credible and cogent, as well as supported in

various aspects by evidence from other witnesses such as Anthony, Agnes, Teo and Alvin.

She therefore found, in reliance on Donald’s evidence, that the appellant had abetted

Donald by conspiring with him to sell the goods belonging to Philips which were entrusted

to his dominion.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">That the goods delivered were the same ones that had been delivered

from JSI</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38        The appellant had argued

that the discrepancies in quantity and evidence given by Donald and Anthony suggesting

that the goods sold were not new meant a break in the chain of evidence linking the goods

sold to those under the appellant’s dominion. As already mentioned, the particulars

of the charges were amended in response to this problem.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39        In coming to her finding,

the trial judge found that Donald’s and Anthony’s evidence were not conclusive

as to whether the goods were new or not. She also relied on evidence given by both Donald

and Teo that prior batches of goods ordered by Agnes were packed and removed before 17 May

2000, which could explain the difference in quantities between what was listed in DO and

what was sold. As to goods whose quantities ordered were in excess of that listed in the

DO, the trial judge accepted on Teo’s evidence that there were excess goods still

lying around the office after 17 May 2000. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">There was no conspiracy between Donald, Agnes, Teo and Alvin to frame

the accused</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40        The trial judge dismissed

this part of the appellant’s defence as without basis in fact.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41        The appellant appealed

against his conviction on the following grounds: a) that entrustment of dominion as stated

in the charge had not been proven by the prosecution; b) that the property over which he

had been entrusted with dominion had not been proven to be the same property that was sold

to Anthony and "Johan"; and c) that the credibility of prosecution witnesses was

suspect and a conviction based on their evidence was unsafe. I shall deal with them each

in turn.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Entrustment of dominion not proven by prosecution</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42        This ground of defence had

already been put before the judge at first instance, and was rejected.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43        The argument revolves

around two aspects – factual and legal. The factual aspect is whether at the material

time of the offences the appellant was still holding on to his position as a Service

Logistics Manager; corollary to this is whether the responsibility of such a position

entailed management responsibility over the relevant goods.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44        The legal aspect is on

whether management responsibility for the goods could be equated to entrustment of

dominion over them. It was also the submission of counsel for the appellant that sole

dominion was necessary for the purposes of criminal breach of trust.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45        With regards to the first

aspect, the trial judge had found that the appellant had not relinquished his position at

the time the offences were committed. Evidence given by all of the employees of PCC at the

trial confirmed that the appellant was still acting as Service Logistics Manager then,

despite his added appointment in March 2000. His argument that his duties had been

relinquished to Lu Ping was facetious since clear evidence was given by Lu Ping and Agnes

that they still reported to the appellant. The only evidence to support the

appellant’s contention was given by an employee of JSI, an outsider. I found that the

trial judge was plainly right in her finding.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46        The appellant also

questioned the accuracy of Spark’s evidence on the responsibilities of Service

Logistics Manager since Sparks was not certain in other parts of his evidence. This, in my

view, is totally without merit. Sparks was clear and firm in his description of the

appellant’s job scope. His uncertainty was only with regard to his memory of recent

changes in appointments within PCC.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47        As to the legal aspect,

the question to be answered is whether the appellant could be said to be entrusted with

dominion over the goods simply because he had management responsibility for them, and, if

so, whether sole dominion over the goods was a necessary element of criminal breach of

trust.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48        In <i>Criminal Law in

Singapore and Malaysia (</i>Koh, Clarkson and Morgan, 1989<i>)</i>, the learned authors

opined at page 588 that "the factor which effectively determines whether there is

entrustment …… of dominion is the degree of control exercised by the

accused".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49        In <i>Birmala Charan Roy</i>

(1913) 35 All 361, a water inspector who was under a duty to check and supervise the

distribution of water from the water works was held to have dominion over the water

belonging to his employers. Further, in <i>State of Rajasthan v Kesar Singh</i> [1969] Cri

L J 1595, the court held that where a person had dominion in the sense of "general

control and supervision" over property entrusted to him in his position as an

employee, he could be liable for criminal breach of trust if he misappropriated the

property or was party to a criminal breach of trust by another person.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50        Both the above cases

plainly support the proposition that a general degree of control can amount to dominion

over a property.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51        I turn next to consider

whether sole dominion is necessary for an offence of criminal breach of trust to be made

out. Such a requirement does not appear within the provision itself. In <i>Criminal Law in

Singapore and Malaysia, </i>the authors stated that it is possible to convict an accused

for criminal breach of trust even if there is concurrently another person in overall

control of the operations or day-to-day running of operations.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52        In <i>Kesar Singh </i>itself,

the accused was an employee of a palace with supervisory power over its staff and affairs.

The alleged offence was in relation to grain stocks not under his direct control. Another

employee was in charge of the delivery and receipt of grain, but had to tender a report to

the accused on each delivery or receipt of grain, which the accused would endorse. The

grain was found to be short and the accused was charged with criminal breach of trust.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53        Although the accused was

found not guilty in that case, this was due solely to the fact that there was a lack of

evidence connecting him to the pilferage of the grain. As such, the case shows clearly

that sole dominion is not a necessary condition to establishing criminal breach of trust.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54        In my opinion, this is

plainly right. The essence of the offence lies in the entrustment of property to an

employee and his subsequent betrayal of that trust. Whether or not there is sole dominion

over the property is irrelevant; what is important is only the fact that the trust was

breached, and this is so equally whether or not dominion of the property was entrusted

solely to a specific employee or to a number of employees, one of whom subsequently

misappropriates the property. It would be ludicrous to say that the latter could not have

committed criminal breach of trust simply by reason of the fact that others were <i>also</i>

entrusted with dominion over said property.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55        On the facts of the case,

the job scope of the appellant clearly involved supervisory and general control over the

goods stored in JSI. He could request for the goods whenever he wanted and have it sent

where ever he wished. He was responsible for their movements and was the overall head of

the department which managed the movement of the goods – the logistics department.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56        Based on the foregoing, I

accordingly found that once the fact of the appellant’s position as Service Logistics

Manager was established at the material time of the transactions, entrustment of dominion

over the relevant property was established.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Property entrusted with dominion over was not the same property which

was misappropriated</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57        It was argued by the

appellant that that there was a break in the chain of evidence to show that the goods the

appellant was entrusted with dominion over was not the same as those sold by Donald. He

relied on evidence given by Donald and Anthony to the effect that the subject matter of

the transactions were second-hand refurbished phones. Teo, who had packed the goods for

sale, also admitted under cross-examination that he was unsure if the goods were new. The

learned trial judge had accepted that the goods ordered by Agnes for the purposes of the

transactions were all brand new. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58        The trial judge dismissed

this as neither Donald nor Anthony had actually examined all the goods sold. She found

that Anthony’s belief that the goods were second-hand came solely from his

conversation with Donald when negotiating the transaction and prices. Agnes had given all

the goods she received to Teo, who had packed them personally. Donald’s evidence on

the goods being second-hand was in the context of the prices that he had negotiated for

them, that is, the price he had sold the goods at were the prices a second-hand version of

the goods would fetch. It is highly plausible that Donald told Anthony the goods were

second-hand in order to alleviate any suspicions of illegality Anthony might have.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59        Teo had given evidence

that, from what he could see, the goods were new. He also gave evidence that goods given

to him by Agnes were packed by him into cartons, and he personally witnessed the delivery

of the carton of goods to Anthony on 17 May 2000. The trial judge had found that the goods

sold by Donald were the same as those over which the appellant had been entrusted

dominion. Having examined the evidence, I see no reason to conclude that she had clearly

reached a wrong decision.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The credibility of prosecution witnesses was suspect and a conviction

based on their evidence was unsafe</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60        The crux of this

submission was that the reliability of the evidence given by three prosecution witnesses

– Donald, Agnes and Alvin; was suspect.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Donald’s evidence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61        Donald’s evidence

directly implicated the appellant in the conspiracy. The defence challenged his

credibility on many grounds, which include:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">i It is implausible that the appellant would have approached him to

  suggest the conspiracy since they were not on close terms.</p>
<p align="justify">ii Donald’s evidence that the appellant approached him in the

  office to suggest the conspiracy from 1 to 6 May 2000 was implausible since there was only

  one day during that period when this would have been possible.</p>
<p align="justify">iii It is highly likely on the evidence that Donald could have

  fulfilled the transactions on his own</p>
<p align="justify">iv Donald’s evidence was riddled with other inconsistencies which

  rendered his evidence suspect.</p>
<p align="justify">v That the fact of Donald being an accomplice coupled with the many

  inconsistencies in his evidence meant that he should be presumed unworthy of credit via

  exercise of the court’s discretion under s116(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62        These had all been argued

before the trial judge, who rejected all of these contentions. I agree with her findings.

Donald’s job scope enabled him to travel widely and meet many people, a fact known to

the appellant. Thus it was not unlikely that he should have been chosen. The appellant

would also have known Donald well enough to seize him up and have an idea of his

suitability as a partner in crime, given that they had been colleagues for over a year.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63        I found the submission in

(ii) to be totally without merit. Donald’s recollection of the appellant’s

approach was clear and unambiguous. The appellant’s absence from office during five

of the six days in the period simply meant that he must have approached Donald in the

office on the day he was present, which was 3 May 2000. This by itself does not cast any

reasonable doubt on Donald’s testimony, especially since there was no evidence that

the appellant could not have approached Donald on that day.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64        With regard to

Donald’s ability to perform the transactions on his own, the evidence clearly showed

that Donald did not have the power to requisition such large quantities of goods as for

the transaction. Only with the appellant’s, or someone from the logistics department,

help would the goods have been able to be requisitioned. Furthermore, there was also

independent evidence which implicated the appellant in the transactions.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65        The appellant had sought

to use the discrepancy in quantities which I have highlighted earlier to support his

contention that Donald was engaged in his own private dealings and that his allegations

against the appellant were false. However, I was of the opinion that the problems raised

by the discrepancy had already been fully dealt with by the trial judge in her findings

and I saw no reason to disturb them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66        Various other

inconsistencies were raised, all of which were fully dealt with by the trial judge in

coming to her decision.<font color="#ff0000"> </font>I could see no fault in her finding

that Donald’s evidence was generally cogent, believable and supported by evidence

from other prosecution witnesses. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67        With regard to the

submission in (v), the trial judge had borne in mind provision 116(b) of the Evidence Act

(Cap 97) when she scrutinised the Donald’s evidence and explicitly cautioned herself

as to this fact. In <i>Jimina Jacee d/o CD Athananasius v PP</i> [2000] 2 SLR 205, I held

that s116(b) of the Evidence Act did not mean that an accomplice’s evidence <i>must </i>be

presumed to be unworthy of credit. The correct approach should be:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Whether or not the accomplice’s evidence is reliable will depend

  on all the circumstance of each case. <i>All that the court is required to do is to

  scrutinise such evidence carefully </i>[italics added]</p>
</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68        In the present case, the

trial judge had correctly directed herself in examining Donald’s evidence.

Furthermore, the fact that Donald had already been charged and sentenced for his part in

the transactions was another factor for believing in the truth of his evidence. The

defence contention that Donald’s testimony was inherently improbable is

unsupportable, and I found their suggestion that he had fabricated his evidence to get a

lighter sentence by minimising his role without any merit, especially since Donald freely

admitted to playing a major part in the transactions.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69        Furthermore, Donald’s

evidence was supported in many respects by evidence of other witnesses. For instance, his

description of the arrangement for collecting the goods for sale pursuant to his agreement

with the appellant was supported by both Agnes and Teo. The strongest supporting evidence

for the existence of the conspiracy comes from the evidence of Alvin in his narration of

the phone calls to him by the appellant, requesting for his aid in covering up evidence of

the appellant’s wrong-doing. In view of all this, I found that the trial judge was

correct in accepting the evidence of Donald and relying on it to prove the existence of

the conspiracy.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Agnes’ evidence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70        Evidence provided by Agnes

helped linked the appellant to the goods which were sold. Agnes gave evidence that the

goods were all ordered on the instructions of the appellant; this, coupled with Teo’s

evidence that the goods sold were taken from Agnes, as well as the correspondence of the

items ordered to those sold, clearly implicated the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71        The trial judge had found

that Agnes was edgy and had difficulty in expressing herself. Although there were material

discrepancies in evidence given by Agnes, these related to other incidents in the sequence

of events leading to the transaction, for example, Agnes had stated that she kept the

delivered goods in a locked cupboard. This was contradicted, however, by Teo and

Charmaine, both of whom asserted that the goods were lying around.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72        With regards to her

evidence on the appellant’s instructions, however, Agnes’ was found by the trial

judge to be reliable. In respect of both her ordering of the goods and the communications

with Donald, the trial judge found that Agnes was clear that she was acting on the

appellant’s instructions. This was consistently held to by her despite vigorous

cross-examination. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73        In <i>PP v Gan Lim Soon</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7448&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 3 SLR 261</a>, the court stated:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">As with so many cases, where the lapse of time has caused memories to

  blur and fade, and result in throwing up many discrepancies in evidence, it is vitally

  important that courts do not lose sight of the wood for the trees.</p>
</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In <i>Ng Kwee Leong v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47168&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 942</a>, I also held that a court

can decide to accept one part of a witness’ testimony while rejecting the other. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74        Applying this approach, I

found nothing wrong in relying on Agnes’ evidence in part. The actual dates and

circumstances of the appellant giving instructions to her are immaterial; what was

important was that these instructions were in fact given. On this, Agnes’ evidence

was cogent and reliable. The fact that she had copied one of her emails ordering the goods

to the appellant lends more weigh to her testimony, as he would surely have suspected

something was amiss if he had truly not been involved in the transactions. I found it hard

to believe the appellant’s explanation that he had not seen the email. The same

approach was adopted by the trial judge, who relied only on the parts of Agnes’

evidence which proved that the goods were ordered on orders from the appellant. She was

entitled to do so.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Alvin’s evidence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">75        Alvin’s evidence

concerning the envelope containing the money is strong circumstantial evidence of the

appellant’s involvement in the conspiracy, as well as supporting Donald’s

version of events.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">76        In relation to the

retrieval of the envelope, Alvin’s version of events was corroborated in various

aspects by Eka, Teo and Lu Ping. The defence’s suggestion that the envelope was

planted is far fetched as Donald would have had to know some six months in advance (he was

investigated for these offences in November 2000) that the transactions would be found

out.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">77        Further, when coupled with

the evidence of the phone calls by the appellant, I found that a strong inference arises

of the appellant’s guilt.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">78        The appellant denied ever

making the alleged phone calls to Alvin. He pointed out that Alvin’s phone records on

24 May 2000, when he claims the appellant called him numerous times to ask for his help,

showed no trace of the appellant’s handphone number.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">79        The trial judge accepted

that the appellant called from an unregistered number – marked as

"ex-directory" in the phone records. I examined the evidence, and in my opinion

she was right in finding this part of Alvin’s evidence to be credible. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">80        Counsel for the appellant

argued strenuously that Alvin’s readiness to assist Donald and the appellant in

retrieving the envelope, even though he had known or must have suspected there something

was amiss, was not normal behaviour. The appellant’s counsel further pointed out that

even after Alvin opened the envelope and saw the money, he continued to keep in contact

with Donald on a regular basis. It was submitted that these actions when viewed together

cast doubt on Alvin’s portrayal of himself as an innocent party to the transactions

in this case, and hence his credibility should be suspect as well. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">81        I found this submission to

be without merit. The only way Alvin’s evidence can be excluded would be if one were

to accept that he was part of a plot to frame the accused. However, the appellant could

not offer any reason why Alvin would wish to frame him. Furthermore, the Alvin’s

retrieval of the envelope (on 24 May 2000) happened a full six months before the appellant

and Donald were investigated in relation to transactions in issue (24 November 2000). It

is hard to imagine that a plot to frame the appellant would have been hatched so long

beforehand. The trial judge had already found Alvin to be a reliable witness. Having

considered the above factors, I found that she was entitled to rely on Alvin’s

evidence.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Alleged conspiracy</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">82        The appellant suggested

the existence of a plot to frame him, involving Donald, Teo, Agnes and Alvin. He raised

the following points in support:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">i That he had had a few incidents at work in which unhappiness arose

  between him and Donald – in particular, the appellant had once told Donald that he

  would be laid off if Donald went for an operation. According to the appellant, Donald had

  thought he was lying and swore to "get him" if he was. The appellant alleges

  that this caused Donald to bear a grudge against him.</p>
<p align="justify">ii That Agnes bore a grudge against him as he was a harsh taskmaster

  and had once scolded her to tears. </p>
<p align="justify">iii That there was general ill-will towards him as he was from Hong

  Kong and a harsh taskmaster</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">83        These allegations were

dismissed by the trial judge. She found the appellant’s version of events to be

unsubstantiated. Donald denied that he had a grudge against the appellant, and Agnes

denied that the incident in (ii) even occurred. She found the third ground to be without

any basis in fact.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">84        In my opinion, the

appellant’s allegation here is plainly fallacious. Supporting evidence pointing to

the appellant’s guilt in some fashion or another had been given by other prosecution

witnesses. To suggest that Donald could have planned such an intricate web of deception

beggars belief, and the trial judge was right in dismissing this.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">85        It is settled law that an

appellate court should be slow to disturb a trial judge’s finding of fact. Reference

can be made to <i>PP v Victor Rajoo s/o Pitchay Muthu </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9562&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 3 SLR 417</a>, where the

Court of Appeal stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The learned trial judge, who had the benefit of seeing

  and hearing the complainant and the accused giving evidence made findings of fact based on

  the veracity and credibility of their respective evidence. Due regard must be given to the

  learned judge’s findings, and such findings should not be disturbed unless we are

  satisfied that he has clearly reached a wrong decision.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Having reviewed all the evidence, I see no reason for me to conclude

that the trial judge has clearly reached a wrong decision. She had the opportunity to

observe the demeanour of all the relevant witnesses in trial, and there is nothing to

suggest to me that her findings were wrong in any way.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">86        For the reasons stated

above, I dismissed the appeal against conviction.</p>
