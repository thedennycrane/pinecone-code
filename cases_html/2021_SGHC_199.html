At that time, the board of directors was controlled by a former director of USP, Mr Yin Kum Choy (“Mr Yin”) (“the Share Acquisition Plan”).

If the plaintiff satisfies this, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show that there is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried (O 14 r 3(1) of the ROC; <span class="font-italic">KLW Holdings Ltd v Straitsworld Advisory Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 35 (“<span class="font-italic">KLW</span>”) at [16]).

The case law makes clear that the proper course is not for the court to assume that every sworn averment is to be accepted as true, or that such an averment may, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, provide a basis for leave to defend (<span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam Asanaru Pillai v Nomanbhoy &amp; Sons Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 … at [38]; see also <span class="font-italic">Goh Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 32 at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 Apart from showing the existence of triable issues, the defendant may also avoid summary judgment by showing “that there ought for some other reason to be a trial” (O 14 r 3(1) of the ROC).

The defendant must be able to show clear justification for this; vague allegations that a case needs to be investigated in the absence of good reason would <span class="font-italic">not</span> constitute some other reason for trial (<span class="font-italic">KLW</span> at [57], citing Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure</span> (Academy Publishing, 2013) at p 267).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As stated in <span class="font-italic">Wiseway Global Co Ltd v Qian Feng Group Ltd </span>[2015] SGHC 85 at [20], the threshold for raising a triable issue is low. In this regard, the court elaborated that: “[i]t is well established that, where there are conflicts as to fact, summary judgment is ordinarily not granted: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2015</span> (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2014) … at [14/4/5]”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In determining whether summary judgment is to be ordered where there is a subsisting counterclaim, the court in <span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid Pte Ltd v Lim Kah Hin (trading as Yik Zhuan Orchid </span><span class="font-italic">Garden)</span> [2018] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid</span>”) has set out a practical framework at [97]–[99]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">97 In my view, the following principles can be gleaned from the case law on the proper approach to be taken when determining whether summary judgment ought to be ordered where there is a subsisting counterclaim. It is useful to try to amalgamate and reconcile where possible these principles and place them within a practical framework for easy reference and application.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98 The recommended framework is as follows.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 1: whether the counterclaim is plausible</span> – the court should first consider whether the counterclaim is plausible, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether it is reasonably possible for the counterclaim to succeed at trial (or in the slightly tortured formulation adopted in [<span class="font-italic">Sheppards &amp; Co v Wilkinson &amp; Jarvis</span> [1889] 6 TLR 13 (“<span class="font-italic">Sheppards</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>)], whether the counterclaim is “so far plausible that it [is] not unreasonably possible for it to succeed if brought to trial”). If the counterclaim is <span class="font-italic">not</span> plausible, then its presence ought not to stand in the way of the plaintiff obtaining summary judgment of its whole claim, without any stay pending the determination of the counterclaim, and the court should so rule. If the court finds that the counterclaim <span class="font-italic">is</span> plausible, then <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 2</span> follows.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 2: whether the plausible counterclaim amounts to a defence of set-off</span> – the court should then determine whether the counterclaim that it has found to be plausible amounts to a defence of set-off, whether legal or equitable. If it finds that the plausible counterclaim <span class="font-italic">does</span> amount to a defence of set-off, then unconditional leave to defend should be granted in respect of the whole of the claim. The reason for such a result is that when the court reaches such a conclusion, it has found in essence that the defendant has shown reasonable grounds of a real defence, and therefore leave to defend should, on the usual principles, be granted. On the other hand, if the counterclaim does <span class="font-italic">not</span> amount to a defence of set-off, then the court may proceed to <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 3</span> below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 3: whether the plausible counterclaim is sufficiently connected to the claim</span> – the court may then consider whether there is a connection between the claim (for which summary judgment is sought) and the counterclaim which it has considered to be plausible. If that counterclaim arises out of quite a separate and distinct transaction or it is wholly foreign to the claim or there is no connection between the claim and counterclaim, the court should generally grant summary judgment of the whole claim, without a stay pending the determination of the unconnected counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the court is satisfied of the degree of connection between the claim and counterclaim, it may proceed to <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 4</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 4: whether there are grounds for a stay of execution in the light of the connected and plausible counterclaim</span> – if the court considers that there is really no defence to the claim and that as a consequence the plaintiff would be put to needless expense in proving its claim, the court should generally grant summary judgment of the whole of the claim. This is the default position where there are no triable issues under the usual approach (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, no fair or reasonable possibility that there is a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence, whether that of setoff or otherwise).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But, in the exercise of its discretion, where the court also finds (through an application of <span class="font-weight-bold">Steps 1 and 3</span> above) that there is <span class="font-italic">a connected and plausible counterclaim</span>, this may provide grounds for the court to stay execution of the whole judgment (or a portion thereof) pending the determination of the connected and plausible counterclaim. A qualification applies in the situation where the quantum of the judgment exceeds that of the quantum of the counterclaim: in such circumstances, there should not be any stay of execution of the quantum of the judgment that is in excess of the counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Beyond the above qualification, whether or not a stay of the whole or a part of the judgment should be granted is ultimately a matter for the court’s discretion, to be exercised according to established principles. The degree of connection between the claim and counterclaim, the strength and quantum of the counterclaim and the ability of the plaintiff to satisfy any judgment on the counterclaim are some of the considerations which the court may take into account in the exercise of its discretion on whether to grant a stay: see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2016</span> at para 14/4/10; and [<span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Pte Ltd v Tru-line Beauty Consultants Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 2 SLR 590 (“<span class="font-italic">Tru-line</span>”)] ([84] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [45]. The exercise of the discretion to grant or to refuse to grant a stay of execution of the whole or a portion of the judgment sum pending trial of a plausible and connected counterclaim will ultimately depend on whether the defendant is able to show that it would be fair and just in all the circumstances of the case to stay the immediate enforcement of the whole or a portion of the judgment sum due to the pending trial of the counterclaim. The burden lies on the defendant to prove that the stay is justifiable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">99 I make one observation regarding <span class="font-weight-bold">Step 4</span>. In my view, where there is no real defence to the claim and therefore summary judgment ought, according to the usual principles, to be granted, the appropriate effect of a connected and plausible counterclaim not amounting to a defence should <span class="font-italic">only</span> be that of a <span class="font-italic">stay of execution</span> pending determination of the counterclaim, rather than that of <span class="font-italic">unconditional leave to defend</span>. In other words, summary judgment ought to be granted in respect of the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> of the claim, rather than merely the part of the claim exceeding that of the counterclaim (with unconditional leave to defend the balance of the claim), in situations where the size of the claim exceeds that of the counterclaim. The reason is that the grant of summary judgment in respect of the part of the claim exceeding that of the counterclaim would lead to no reduction in the trouble and expense that the plaintiff would be put to at trial. In order to pursue the remaining part of the claim for which the defendant has been granted unconditional leave to defend, the plaintiff would still have to head to trial and lead – in all likelihood – <span class="font-italic">the very same type and amount of evidence</span> that he would have needed to lead if his application for summary judgment had utterly failed in the first place and he therefore had to prove the entirety of his claim. The only benefit he obtains from his success in the summary judgment application is immediate entitlement to the quantum of the claim exceeding that of the counterclaim. The problem is made even more evident when the size of the counterclaim exceeds that of the claim. In such a situation, it would be perverse for unconditional leave to be granted to defend the whole of the claim, even in the absence of any triable issues in the claim; the correct response when there is really no real defence – as pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Sheppards</span> ([91] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) – is surely that of summary judgment subject only to a stay at the court’s discretion. Any other approach would lead to a wastage of costs and the time of the court, the litigants and the witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My findings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether the defendant’s pleadings were defective</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As a preliminary issue, I shall address the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendant has only pleaded one defence, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, estoppel by representation.

Notwithstanding this discrepancy, the above evidence still suggests that there were discussions for USP shares held by Bestway to be transferred to Mr Huang and/or the defendant to hold as a nominee as requested by Mr Li. Moreover, these USP shares were to be held for the benefit of Mr Li’s <span class="font-italic">friend</span>, which <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>supports the defendant’s claim that they are the Purported Chinese Investors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Furthermore, the defendant has also adduced WhatsApp messages by Mr Li which shows explicit references to Chinese investors. She claims that on or before 8 November 2020, approximately 9 months after entering into the two IFLAs, she asked Mr Huang if it was possible for her to return the Shares to the Purported Chinese Investors. She felt uncomfortable about holding onto the Shares for so long, especially in light of an ongoing litigation commenced by USP against Mr Li and Mr Tanoto.

</div>
</div> The truth of this assertion is a matter that requires the assistance of expert evidence, which should then be tested at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 From the above evidence, I am satisfied that the defendant has shown that there are substantive triable issues in the present case. These issues include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the plaintiff, through Mr Li, made the alleged representations regarding the Share Acquisition Plan and the circumstances then, which the defendant relied on when she entered into the two IFLAs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the plaintiff or the Purported Chinese Investors are the beneficial owners of the Shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the two IFLAs were genuine loan contracts or sham agreements that embodied no intention to create legal relations.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Whether the plaintiff agreed to compensate the defendant for holding the shares for and on behalf of the Purported Chinese Investors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I reiterate that the threshold for raising a triable issue is low and summary judgment is generally not granted where there are conflicts as to fact (see [35] above). Here, the evidence that the defendant has adduced suggest a different but plausible narrative in contradistinction to the plaintiff’s simple and straightforward one, which was premised on the plain terms of the two IFLAs. The issues raised by the defendant’s plausible narrative should be tried and her evidence adduced should be tested at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As I have stated earlier, the defendant’s defence and counterclaim are premised on the same facts (see [(1)] above). Hence, I also find that her counterclaim is plausible, which satisfies Step 1 of the framework in <span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid</span>. I do not find that the counterclaim amounts to a defence of set-off under Step 2, especially since the defendant is seeking a declaration that the plaintiff is not entitled to the Shares. Hence, I proceed to Step 3. The counterclaim is clearly sufficiently connected to the plaintiff’s claim, as both arise out of the issue of the beneficial ownership of the Shares. Under Step 4, I find that the defendant has a real defence to the present claim. Thus, there is insufficient basis to order summary judgment and a stay of execution pending the determination of the counterclaim which should be allowed (see [67] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Analysis of the two IFLAs</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the two IFLAs, the plaintiff agreed to loan two sums to the defendant for specific purposes. In the First IFLA, it was to loan the defendant $1,460,291 without interest to purchase 7,301,455 USP shares from Bestway. In the Second IFLA, the plaintiff loaned to the defendant $395,859.64 without interest to purchase 1,799,362 USP shares from Mr Zeng. These interest-free loans to the defendant were only to purchase USP shares from the two different entities specified in the two IFLAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 At the end of three months, the plaintiff was entitled to sell the Shares or take over the Shares from the defendant. A plain reading of the two IFLAs suggests that the plaintiff could sell the Shares or take over the Shares from the defendant even if the loans were repaid before the three months stipulated in the two IFLAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56  It is important to note that the focus of the two IFLAs seems to be on the USP shares, as opposed to the principal sums. If the loans were not repaid after three months and the market price of the Shares was lower than the principal sums, the two IFLAs are silent on whether the plaintiff could have a recourse against the defendant for the difference. Conversely, if the market value of the Shares was higher than the principal sums, the two IFLAs are also silent on whether the plaintiff should pay the defendant the difference. It is peculiar that these usual terms found in loan agreements are missing in the two IFLAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57   It is also interesting that the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim is not seeking for the return of the principal sums of the two IFLAs but for the Shares. I would have thought that the logical focus of the claim should have been for the principal sums and not for the Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58  The above observations suggest that there could be some truths in the defendant’s case as there could be more to the IFLAs than meets the eyes. Therefore, it is unsafe to dismiss the appeal and allow the plaintiff to enter summary judgment without the rigor of a trial to ascertain the truths of the present disputes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Parol evidence rule</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I should also add that the above evidence is not excluded by the operation of the parol evidence rule under s 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Section 94 of the Evidence Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Exclusion of evidence of oral agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">94. When the terms of any such contract, grant or other disposition of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been <span class="font-italic">proved according to section 93</span>, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument or their representatives in interest for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms subject to the following provisions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hence, where s 93 of the Evidence Act applies, the general rule provided under s 94 is that no evidence of any oral agreement or statement can be admitted to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract from the terms of the written contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In <span class="font-italic">Toh Eng Tiah v Jiang Angelina</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2021] 1 SLR 1176 at [77] (“<span class="font-italic">Toh Eng Tiah</span>”), the Court of Appeal held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">allegation is that the agreement was a sham</span>, this is a question that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">goes to the very existence of the contract</span> – if proved, the existence of a sham means that the agreement was not intended to create enforceable legal obligations but was intended to deceive third parties. It follows, therefore, that the issue of whether there is a sham is <span class="font-italic">prior to</span> and <span class="font-italic">will</span> <span class="font-italic">necessarily not engage</span> s 93 and, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">accordingly, s 94 of the [Evidence Act]</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis in bold italics added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Hence, s 94 of the Evidence Act does not apply where there is an allegation that the contract at hand is a sham agreement.

Where there is an allegation that the purported contract is a sham agreement, the logical inquiry would be whether <span class="font-italic">there was even a contract </span><span class="font-italic">in the first place</span>. In such a scenario, as indicated above, s 93 of the Evidence Act does not apply; accordingly, neither does s 94.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 On the present facts, the defendant’s case is that the two IFLAs are sham agreements (see [12] above). Her narrative is that she had only signed these agreements to show the Purported Chinese Investors that their monies were being used to purchase Shares. Indeed, the defendant’s narrative is diametrically opposed to that of the plaintiff’s case, which the plaintiff acknowledges in her submissions. The plaintiff argues that because the representations alleged by the defendant are directly contradictory to the terms of the two IFLAs, the AR’s finding that paragraphs 5(c) to 5(f) of the defendant’s defence “cannot hold water in light of the parol evidence rule” should not be disturbed.

</div> In my view, it is <span class="font-italic">precisely</span> because the defendant’s narrative is so different from the plaintiff’s that the parol evidence rule does <span class="font-italic">not</span> apply. Here, the defendant alleges the two IFLAs are sham agreements while the plaintiff alleges that the two IFLAs are valid agreements. As held in <span class="font-italic">Toh Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Tiah</span>, the allegation of a sham agreement goes to the existence of a valid contract, which excludes the operation of s 93 of the Evidence Act. By extension, s 94 will not apply and the defendant’s evidence is thus admissible.

</div> In any case, even if the defendant’s case was not premised on the two IFLAs being sham agreements and s 93 of the Evidence Act is thus applicable, this case would come under the exception in s 94(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Evidence Act as there was an allegation of fraud that may invalidate the two IFLAs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Conclusion on summary judgment</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I am satisfied that the defendant has raised triable issues in the present case and that there is a fair or reasonable probability that she has a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence.

I set out the court’s succinct summary in <span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Wan and another v Lian Tian Yong Johnny</span> [2016] SGHC 206 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Wan</span>”) at [39]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) O 18 r 19(1)(a): “it discloses no reasonable cause of action”. This involves an action which does not even have “some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered”: <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span>”) at [21].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) O 18 r 19(1)(b): “it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) A matter is “scandalous” where it does not even have a “tendency to show” the truth of any allegation material to the relief sought: <span class="font-italic">Lai Swee Lin Linda v AG</span> [2006] 2 SLR (R) 565 at [67], citing <span class="font-italic">Christie v Christie</span> (1872-1873) LR 8 Ch App 499 at 503.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) “Frivolous or vexatious” means “obviously unsustainable” or “wrong”. A case that is “plainly and obviously unsustainable” is one which is either legally or factually unsustainable. A case is <span class="font-italic">legally  unsustainable</span> if “it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks”. <span class="font-italic">A case is factually unsustainable</span> if it is “possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance, [for example, if it is] clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based”: <span class="font-italic">The “Bunga Melati 5”</span> [2012] 4 SLR 546 at [39].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) O 18 r 19(1)(b) could also apply to a case where the party bringing an action is not acting <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and  merely wishes to annoy or embarrass his opponent, or where there was a lack of purpose or seriousness in the party’s conduct of proceedings: <span class="font-italic">The “Osprey”</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099 at [8].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) O 18 r 19(1)(c): “it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action”. Pleadings which could be struck out on this ground include those which are unnecessary, which include improper or irrelevant details, or where allegations unrelated to the issues were made for the purpose of embarrassing or vexing the opposing party: see Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure</span> (Academy Publishing, 2013) at para 9.008.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) O 18 r 19(1)(d): “it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court”. An abuse of process of court means using the court machinery as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation. For example, where a claim is brought not for the purposes of relief but for some other collateral or ulterior motive: <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span> at [22].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The court should only exercise its power to strike out in “plain and obvious cases”, which is a high threshold. The question of whether a point is plain and obvious does not depend on the duration it takes to be argued, but whether it is plain and obvious that it yields only one result when argued: <span class="font-italic">Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs v Hashu Dhalomal Shahdadpuri and another </span>[2011] 2 SLR 967 at [37], citing <span class="font-italic">Bank of China v Asiaweek Ltd </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 230 at [6]. In the present case, it means that the defendant’s counterclaim is so plainly and obviously weak that it discloses no cause of action and striking out is warranted. Hence, the court should not carry out a “minute and protracted examination of the documents and the facts of the case in reaching [its] decision: <span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Wan</span> at [40], citing <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others</span> [1997] 3 SLR (R) 649 at [18] and <span class="font-italic">The “Osprey” </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099 at [6].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I have stated earlier that the defendant’s counterclaim is premised on the same facts that she relies on in her defence (see [41] and [53] above). I have also found that summary judgment should not be entered in favour of the plaintiff (see [63] above). Given that the threshold for a striking out application (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a plain and obvious case) is higher than that for an application for summary judgment, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, the plaintiff’s application for striking out cannot stand. Furthermore, the defendant has raised a <span class="font-italic">prim</span><span class="font-italic">a facie</span> case for her counterclaim against the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the reasons above, I allow the defendant’s appeal in RA 215 and RA 216 and grant the defendant unconditional leave to defend in Suit 242. I also set aside the costs order for SUM 2109 and SUM 2112 of $12,000 (all-in).
