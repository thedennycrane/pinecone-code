<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiffs have filed this originating
                    summons for an order that winding up petitions, CWU 168 of 2009 and
                    CWU 169 of 2009, brought by the defendant against the first and second
                    plaintiffs respectively be stayed or struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On or about 26 October 2007, the first
                    plaintiff chartered a vessel from the defendant. Pursuant to a guarantee dated
                    12 October 2007, the second plaintiff stood as the first plaintiff’s
                    guarantor against the first plaintiff’s obligations to the defendant. On
                    12 August 2009, the defendant sent the plaintiffs statutory notices of
                    demand for a sum of US$3,986,157.16 as the outstanding sum owing as charter hire
                    under a charter agreement. US$1,326,625.04 of this demand represented an
                    arbitration award issued by the London Tribunal dated 18 December 2008
                    (then entitled “Interim” but which is now final in its effect)
                    (the “Award”). The first plaintiff has paid US$350,000 of the
                    arbitration award debt under a settlement agreement that has expired and to date
                    US$976,625.04 remains due and outstanding. When the plaintiffs failed to respond
                    satisfactorily to the defendant after three weeks, the defendant proceeded to
                    file winding up petitions CWU 168 of 2009 and CWU 169 of 2009 pursuant
                    to s 254(2)(<em>a</em>) read with
                        s 254(1)(<em>e</em>) of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiffs aver that the winding up
                    petitions are an abuse of process because there is a <em>bona
                        fide</em> dispute on substantial grounds. The grounds as submitted by
                    the plaintiffs are as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Award is not enforceable against the first
                            plaintiff save by recognition or enforcement under the International
                            Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”).
                            The interim award would not have been recognised or enforced under the
                            IAA because it contravenes s 31(2)(<em>c</em>)
                            of the IAA in that it was obtained in circumstances where the first
                            plaintiff was denied an opportunity to and was thereby unable to present
                            its case. I shall refer to these as the “IAA
                            issue”.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The first plaintiff has a cross-claim equal to or
                            exceeding the debt allegedly due under the Award. I shall refer to this
                            as the “Cross-claim issue”.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Award is unenforceable against the second
                            plaintiff as it is against the first plaintiff and in any case the
                            guarantor is not bound by the Award. I shall refer to the last as the
                            “Guarantor’s Liability issue”.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Threshold Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       A winding up petition is not the appropriate
                    means of collecting a disputed debt nor is it to be abused as a means of
                    pressure. The issue before me is whether there is a <em>bona
                        fide</em> and substantial dispute of the alleged debt on any of the
                    grounds raised by the plaintiffs. This is the threshold which the plaintiffs
                    must meet in support of their application to stay or strike out the winding up
                    petitions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there is a <em>bona fide</em> and
                substantial dispute over the debt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In <em>BNP Paribas v Jurong
                        Shipyard Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 at [15], the Court
                    of Appeal held that the “general rule is that, where a company is unable
                    or deemed to be unable to pay its debts, the creditor is <em>prima facie</em> entitled to a winding-up order <em>ex
                        debito justitiae</em>”. However, the court nonetheless retains
                    the discretion not to grant a winding up order in exceptional cases. One
                    instance when a court may refuse to grant a winding up order, but may instead
                    stay or strike out the winding up petition, is where the debtor-company
                    establishes that there is a <em>bona fide</em> dispute of
                    the statutory debt. To obtain the stay or striking out, the debtor company must
                    show that the dispute is <em>bona fide</em> in both a
                    subjective and objective sense. <em>Palmer’s Company
                        Law</em> vol 3 at pp 15068-15069, as quoted approvingly in
                        <em>LKM Investment Holdings Pte Ltd v Cathay Theatres Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 135 at [20], elucidates:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the dispute must be bona fide in both a subjective and an
                        objective sense. Thus the reason for not paying the debt must be honestly
                        believed to exist and must be based on substantial or reasonable grounds.
                        'Substantial' means having substance and not frivolous, which disputes the
                        court should ignore. There must be so much doubt and question about the
                        liability to pay the debt that the court sees that there is a question to be
                        decided. The onus is on the company 'to bring forward a prima facie case
                        which satisfies the court that there is something which ought to be tried
                        either before the court itself or in an action, or by some other
                        proceedings.'</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Nonetheless, the debtor-company does not need to show that the debt
                    does not exist – it merely needs to raise a triable issue. In <em>Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another
                        appeal</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [23], the Court of Appeal
                    held that the applicable standard for determining the existence of a substantial
                    and <em>bona fide</em> dispute was “no more than
                    that for resisting a summary judgment application”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       With the applicable principles in mind, I now
                    turn to examining the IAA issue, the Cross-claim issue and the Guarantor’s
                    Liability issue respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The IAA issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiffs dispute the debt that is founded
                    on the interim arbitration award as being improperly obtained by reason of the
                    alleged failure to observe the rules of natural justice. The defendant, in
                    response, points out that the regularity of the award had been unchallenged at
                    the arbitration and at the courts of the seat of the arbitration. The defendant
                    cited the following authorities:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">
<em>Minmetals Germany GmbH v Ferco
                                Steel Ltd</em> [1999] CLC 647 at 661where it was
                            stated that:</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In international commerce a party who contracts into an agreement to
                        arbitrate in a foreign jurisdiction is bound not only by the local
                        arbitration procedure but also by the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts
                        of the seat of the arbitration. If the award is defective or the arbitration
                        is defectively conducted the party who complains of the defect must in the
                        first instance pursue such remedies as exist under that supervisory
                        jurisdiction. That is because by his agreement to the place in question as
                        the seat of the arbitration he has agreed not only to refer all disputes to
                        arbitration but that the conduct of the arbitration should be subject to
                        that particular supervisory jurisdiction. Adherence to that part of the
                        agreement must, in my judgment, be a cardinal policy consideration by an
                        English court considering enforcement of a foreign award.</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">
<em>Aloe Vera of America, Inc v
                                Asianic Food (S) Pte Ltd and another</em> [2006]
                            3 SLR(R) 174 where it was stated at [56]:</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… a party may be precluded by his failure to raise a point before
                        the court of supervisory jurisdiction from raising that point before the
                        court of enforcement. This is because failure to raise such a point may
                        amount to an estoppel or a want of bona fides such as to justify the court
                        of enforcement in enforcing an award.</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No"></div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">and further at [76]:</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">There was nothing thereafter to stop him from challenging the
                        Arbitrator’s preliminary holding in the courts of Arizona or from
                        taking part in the arbitration itself or from challenging the
                        Arbitrator’s final holding in the courts of Arizona. Having chosen not
                        to participate in the proceedings, it really does not lie in
                        Mr Chiew’s mouth to say that he has been deprived of natural
                        justice because the Arbitrator made one finding in his interim award and
                        supplemented that with an additional finding in the final award.
                        Mr Chiew had the benefit of legal advice in Arizona at all material
                        times and his decision not to have recourse to the supervisory court was a
                        calculated one. If his choice has proved to be a miscalculation, public
                        policy does not require that I relieve him from the consequences of such
                        miscalculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The law set out in the above cases is
                    uncontroversial. However, the above cases deal with the position of a challenge
                    of the arbitration awards made before the enforcement court, where the relevant
                    awards are alleged to be defective but had been unchallenged at the arbitration
                    or at the courts in the seat of arbitration. They do not address the issue that
                    is before me here, which is not a proceeding for the enforcement of an
                    arbitration award under the IAA, but a winding up application. The defendant in
                    this case, has issued a statutory demand of a debt under s 254(2)(<em>a</em>) read with s 254(1)(<em>e</em>) of the Companies Act, the debt having arisen by reason of a
                    final international arbitration award. While the plaintiffs alleged that this
                    Award is defective, it was unchallenged in the arbitration forum and before the
                    courts of the seat of arbitration. The Award therefore remains effective on the
                    face of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The real question before me is whether the
                    defendant is precluded from issuing a statutory demand under
                        s 254(2)(<em>a</em>) read with
                        s 254(1)(<em>e</em>) of the Companies Act based on
                    a debt that is founded on an arbitration award because such an award can only
                    and exclusively be enforced under the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiffs assert that the defendant is
                    obliged to enforce the Award under s 27(2) of the IAA. They argue that had
                    the defendant sought to enforce its arbitration award in Singapore under the
                    IAA, this would have been resisted pursuant to s 31(2)(<em>c</em>) of the IAA on the ground that the rules of natural justice
                    were not adhered to in obtaining that award (see <em>Kanoria v
                        Guinness</em> [2006] EWCA Civ 222). In any case, to permit
                    the defendant to rely on its statutory demand debt founded on the Award which
                    was not enforced under the IAA, would be, they argue, in effect enforcing the
                    interim award under s 27(2) of the IAA. As such the enforcement remains
                    susceptible to the challenge of alleged breach of natural justice which would be
                    available under s 31(2)(<em>c</em>) of the IAA and there
                    therefore exists a <em>prima facie bona fide</em> dispute
                    of the debt on substantial grounds. The plaintiffs further attack the validity
                    of the interim award on the ground that the tribunal issued the award on a basis
                    which had not been raised or contemplated by the parties (see <em>Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another</em>
                    [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [30]). Against this, the defendant argues that
                    it is free to elect either to enforce the Award in Singapore under the IAA or to
                    use the debt arising therefrom as the foundation of its statutory demand for the
                    purposes of a winding up petition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Section 27(2) of the IAA reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this Part, where the context so admits, “enforcement” in
                        relation to a foreign award, includes the recognition of the award as
                        binding for any purpose, and “enforce” and
                        “enforced” have corresponding meanings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I am unable to accept the plaintiffs’ argument that the
                    defendant must enforce the Award under this provision of the IAA before it can
                    bring the winding up proceedings against the plaintiffs. No authority is cited
                    to me for the proposition that a successful party of a foreign arbitration award
                    is obliged and confined to enforce the award only by way of enforcement
                    proceedings under the IAA and is thereby precluded from issuing a statutory
                    demand based on a foreign arbitration award followed, if unsatisfied, by a
                    winding up application on grounds of a presumption of insolvency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Furthermore, the IAA was by the terms of its
                    Preamble, enacted to make provision for the conduct of international commercial
                    arbitrations based on the UNCITRAL Model Law and to give effect to the New York
                    Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards
                    (“New York Convention”). Part III of the IAA governs foreign
                    awards under the New York Convention of 1958. Section 29(<em>a</em>) which is in Part III of the IAA, provides that a foreign
                    award may be enforced in a court either under s 19, by action or in the
                    same manner as a judgment or order, with leave of the court. Significantly,
                    s 33 which is also within Part III of the statute, provides that
                    nothing in that Part shall affect the right of any person to enforce an arbitral
                    award otherwise than as is provided for in this Part. In other words, the IAA
                    provides a platform which a party may have an award in its favour recognised and
                    enforced, but it is not the only means by which a party may seek to utilise the
                    award it has obtained. Quite apart from the summary registration process
                    available under the IAA, a foreign arbitration award may be enforced and
                    recognised at common law (see Rule 59 and 60 of <em>Dicey,
                        Morris &amp; Collins, The Conflict of Laws</em>, Vol 1 (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 14th edition 2006) at p 751-762).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In any event, with respect to the alleged
                    breach of natural justice, I note the approach of the courts to be circumspect
                    in upholding the integrity of the arbitration process. In <em>Soh
                        Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 86, V K Rajah JA opined at [65(f)]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Each case should be decided within its own factual matrix. It must always
                        be borne in mind that it is not the function of the court to assiduously
                        comb an arbitral award microscopically in attempting to determine if there
                        was any blame or fault in the arbitral process; rather, an award should be
                        read generously such that only meaningful breaches of the rules of natural
                        justice that have actually caused prejudice are ultimately remedied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Robert Merkin, in Singapore Arbitration Legislation Annotated
                    (Informa, 2009) at p 76 observes:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… something far removed from what is required of the arbitral
                        process is required and because the losing party will normally have a right
                        to seek to have the award overturned by the courts of the jurisdiction in
                        which the award was given, and if the losing party has sought but failed to
                        obtain relief from the curial courts, or has unreasonably not invoked the
                        jurisdiction of the curial courts, the award will generally be enforced by
                        the courts. A party can either apply for the setting aside of the award to
                        the courts of the country where the award was made, or oppose enforcement in
                        the courts of the country of enforcement; a decision made by the court of
                        the country of the award is binding, so that the options are in practical
                        terms alternative not cumulative; …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It is not disputed that the Award in favour of
                    the defendant for the sum of US$ 1,326,625.04 with interest and costs, is
                    final and binding under the relevant arbitration rules and was not challenged
                    before the courts of the seat of the arbitration. Neither is it disputed that
                    the remaining arbitration proceedings that continue relate to other hire
                    statements between the parties, which do not affect the Award on which the
                    statutory demand is founded. Quite apart from the circumstances surrounding the
                    tribunal’s issue of the Award, that the first plaintiff had taken no
                    further available action in the arbitration and in the seat of arbitration and
                    continued to participate before the same tribunal in other claims, confirms my
                    conclusion that there are not existent, substantial grounds establishing a
                        <em>bona fide</em> dispute relating to the debt on this
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     With regard to the plaintiffs’ attack on
                    the validity of the interim award on the ground that the tribunal issued the
                    interim award on a basis that had not been raised or contemplated by the
                    parties, I would observe that such objections ought also to have been raised in
                    the arbitration. The winding up proceeding, which is separate from enforcement
                    proceedings (see <em>Re International Tin Council</em>
                    [1987] Ch 419 (“<em>International Tin
                        Council</em>”)), is not a proper arena for ventilating such
                    objections especially when these objections have not been raised before the
                    arbitration tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiffs also submit that the issue as
                    to the enforceability of the Award is complex and would, in all likelihood,
                    involve many legal and factual arguments and should not be determined by a court
                    exercising its winding up jurisdiction. In <em>International Tin
                        Council</em>, Millet J addressed the question, in another
                    context, whether a petition for the winding up of International Tin Council on
                    the ground that it was insolvent and presented by a creditor with the benefit of
                    an arbitration award in its favour, was a proceeding in respect of the
                    enforcement of an arbitration award. To that, he observed at 455–456 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am not satisfied that, in this context, the presentation and hearing of
                        a winding up petition, as distinct from the proof of debt in the winding up,
                        are properly to be classified as falling within the enforcement jurisdiction
                        at all. It is fallacious to suppose that, because the petitioner is not
                        seeking to establish his debt, the court is exercising its enforcement
                        jurisdiction. Even if the petitioner has previously resorted to litigation
                        to establish his debt, the presentation of a petition marks the commencement
                        of an entirely new lis. The issue at the hearing is not whether the
                        petitioning and other creditors, some of whom will not yet have established
                        their claims, should be paid, but whether the company is insolvent and, if
                        so, whether it should be wound up or allowed to try to trade out of its
                        difficulties. There is much to be said for the view that, in deciding
                        whether or not the company should be wound up, the court is engaged in a new
                        process of adjudication, separate and different from any that may previously
                        have been involved in establishing the petitioning creditor’s
                        debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But it is not necessary to decide this, for in my judgment the winding up
                        process is plainly not a method of enforcing a judgment or arbitration
                        award. … Far from enabling any judgment or award to be enforced, the
                        making of a winding up order prevents it. ... Whether the petition is
                        presented by a creditor or by the debtor, its purpose is to obtain an order
                        which will preclude the creditors from enforcing any judgments or awards
                        which they may have obtained, and substitute the right to participate in a
                            <em>pari passu</em> distribution out of an
                        insufficient fund in full satisfaction of their claims. That is not the
                        enforcement of their judgments or awards, but the opposite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The <em>International Tin
                        Council</em> case squarely addresses this issue and concludes that the
                    winding up application is not regarded as an enforcement of arbitration awards.
                    I am not required to consider enforceability issues in these proceedings. There
                    is further tangentially the same broad approach reflected in relation to
                    s 11 of the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 265,
                    2001 Rev Ed), which gives general effect to registered foreign judgments.
                    Section 7 of this statute expressly confines the enforcement of sums
                    payable under registrable foreign judgments to being enforced by registration
                    and to no other Singapore court proceedings. In Halsbury’s Laws of
                    Singapore, Vol 2 (Butterworths Asia, 1998), at para 20.152, it is
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Foreign judgments which are not registered for enforcement or are not
                        registrable for enforcement may however be ‘recognised’ (as
                        opposed to being enforced by way of execution) as conclusive of findings of
                        fact and law in proceedings which may be commenced in the Singapore courts
                        based on the original cause of action or related proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the premises there is, in my view, no
                    obstacle to a statutory demand being made for the purposes of
                        s 254(2)(<em>a</em>) read with
                        s 254(1)(<em>e</em>) of the Companies Act, which
                    is founded on a binding arbitration award whether or not such arbitration award
                    has been otherwise enforced by registration under the International Arbitration
                    Act. I find also that the submission that there is continuing arbitration
                    between the parties relating to other claims which have no direct bearing on
                    this particular interim award not to constitute a <em>bona
                        fide</em> dispute on substantial grounds of this debt constituted by
                    the binding arbitration award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At this juncture, I would add that it should
                    be noted that the statutory demand is quite distinct from enforcing the award.
                    All it establishes is that the unsatisfied demand results in a presumption of
                    insolvency being a ground for winding up. Upon an order for winding up being
                    made, the liquidator would be responsible for the orderly determination and
                    discharge of the company’s liabilities against is assets. The liquidator
                    remains at liberty to dispute any proof of debt by the defendant based on the
                    arbitration award. Should a liquidator dispute such debt, notwithstanding the
                    obstacles set out in <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>, the defendant may
                    then be obliged to either register or enforce the award under the IAA. In such
                    event, it is not inconceivable that a registration or enforcement court may
                    refuse registration under s 31(2)(<em>c</em>) of the
                    IAA. Would such a possibility, however remote, give pause for thought about such
                    an award being the basis of a statutory demand presumption of insolvency? I
                    think not because the primary considerations arising in the context of
                    insolvency relate to the protection of all creditors and not the debtor whose
                    unsatisfied claim which a later court may decide to be
                unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Cross-claim issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The next question is whether I should stay the
                    winding up application by reason that the first plaintiff’s cross-claim
                    under the remaining arbitration proceedings may exceed the debt. In addition to
                    the cross-claim in the arbitration proceedings, as indicated in the affidavit of
                    Huang Yingjun, a director of the first plaintiff, dated 11 December 2009,
                    the defendant had also arrested the plaintiffs’ associated vessel in South
                    Africa. While the plaintiffs are currently contesting the arrest, in the event
                    that they fail and arrest not be lifted and the vessel sold, it is submitted
                    that the sale proceeds will exceed the sum payable to the defendant under the
                    statutory demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     There is, in principle no distinction between
                    a cross-claim of substance and a serious dispute regarding the indebtedness
                    imputed against a company, which has long been held to constitute a proper
                    ground upon which to reject a winding-up petition (see <em>Malayan Plant (Pte) Ltd v Moscow Narodny Bank Ltd</em> [1979 –
                    1980] SLR(R) 511 at [18]). A debtor-company may rely on a cross-claim
                    against its creditor to seek a striking out or stay of winding up proceeding,
                    although it has to satisfy the court that on the evidence there is a distinct
                    possibility that the cross-claim may exceed the undisputed debt (see <em>Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 268 (“<em>Metalform</em>”)
                    at [82]). In <em>Re L</em>.<em>H</em>.<em>F</em>. <em>Wools
                        Ltd</em> [1970] 1 Ch 27, a creditor petitioned for the
                    winding up of a debtor-company whose sole asset was a cross-claim against the
                    creditor. The debtor-company sought an adjournment or dismissal of the petition
                    on the basis of the cross-claim. The Court of Appeal held that when a
                    debtor-company had a genuine and serious cross-claim against the petitioning
                    creditor which it had not reasonably been able to litigate, the petition should
                    be usually dismissed or stayed. The Court of Appeal stayed the winding up
                    petition pending the trial of the cross-claim on the basis that (a) there was a
                    genuine and serious cross-claim against the petitioner, (b) the
                    debtor-company’s directors would be better able than a liquidator to
                    prosecute its claim against the petitioner and (c) the delay in winding up would
                    not in any event prejudice the petitioner as the debtor-company had no assets
                    save for the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The decision whether or not to stay or dismiss
                    a winding up petition on the basis of the existence of a cross-claim against the
                    petitioning creditor involves two competing concerns. The first is articulated
                    in <em>Paganelli Sdn Bhd v Care-Me Direct Sales Sdn
                        Bhd</em> [1999] 2 MLJ 464 where the Malaysian High Court
                    considered the implications of a stay against a winding up petition:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the respondent should not have to suffer a petition of winding up
                        a day longer than necessary and neither should they have reimposed upon them
                        the uncertainty and hardship which a reinstatement of the winding-up
                        petition will bring.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second is elucidated in <em>Metalform</em> at
                    [82]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the commercial viability of a company should not be put in
                        jeopardy by the premature presentation of a winding-up petition against it
                        where it has a serious cross-claim based on substantial grounds. Such a
                        petition may adversely affect the reputation and the business of the company
                        and may also set in motion a process that may create cross-defaults or cut
                        the company off from further sources of financing, thereby exacerbating its
                        financial condition. … Businesses that have a chance of recovery
                        should not be pushed into a state that makes it difficult for them to
                        recover.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     If the first plaintiff has a genuine and
                    serious cross-claim against the defendant, the <em>locus
                        standi</em> of the defendant to present a winding-up petition against
                    the plaintiffs would be called into question and a stay or striking out of the
                    winding-up petition would be justified by the concern that the commercial
                    viability of the plaintiffs ought not to be put in jeopardy by the premature
                    presentation of the petition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The first plaintiff asserts that it has a
                    cross-claim against the defendant, which arises from an implied term of the
                    charterparty that the vessel be commercially acceptable or marketable in the
                    market for sub-charters. The alternative basis for its claim is that there was a
                    collateral contract that the vessel be commercially acceptable or marketable in
                    the market for sub-charters. The breach of this term, it is averred, is a
                    repudiatory breach which entitles the first plaintiff to terminate the
                    charterparty and seek damages which would exceed or be equivalent to the
                    defendant’s arbitration claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendant, on the other hand, points out
                    that the first plaintiff has not filed any counterclaim against the defendant in
                    the ongoing London arbitration and accordingly whatever the outcome of the
                    arbitration, it would have no bearing on the debt comprised in the
                award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I find little merit in the plaintiffs’
                    case for a cross-claim as quite apart from it not having been hitherto raised in
                    the arbitration proceedings there is further absent in these proceedings, any
                    substantiated quantification of the cross-claim as would reveal that it is
                    likely to approximate or exceed the statutory demand debt. I am not satisfied
                    that the plaintiffs have made their case that the statutory demand debt has not
                    been properly established and/or that there is a <em>bona
                        fide</em> dispute of the debt on substantial grounds. The presumption
                    of insolvency under s 254(2)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Companies Act operates so long as the debtor does not pay a sum which is not in
                    dispute and that sum exceeds the minimum prescribed therein (see <em>Re Makin Nominees Pte Ltd</em> [1994]
                    2 SLR(R) 848).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Guarantor’s Liability issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The second plaintiff first relied on the first
                    plaintiff’s submission that there is a <em>bona
                        fide</em> dispute as to the debt which arises from the allegedly
                    defective award. I have addressed this above in [7] – [18] and find no
                    merit in this submission. The second plaintiff next relied also on the first
                    plaintiff’s disputes relating to the debt which I have found
                    unmeritorious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The second plaintiff independently disputes
                    the debt founded on its guarantee, on the ground that it is was not a party to
                    the arbitration. The second plaintiff cites <em>PT Jaya Sumpiles
                        Indonesia and another v Kristle Trading Ltd and another</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 689 for the proposition that an award against a principal
                    debtor is not binding on a guarantor in an action by the creditor against the
                    guarantor based on the award. The guarantor not being a party to the arbitration
                        <em>qua</em> guarantor, that principle is clear. The
                        decision, however, goes much further to elaborate at [42]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Instead, should the creditor sue the guarantor, it must prove the guarantor’s
                    liability in the same way as it must prove the principal debtor’s
                    liability if it were to bring an action against the principal
                    debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Under its guarantee dated 12 October
                    2007, it unconditionally guaranteed the defendant in the following
                    terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… due, full and complete performance in every respect
                    by the said charterers of all terms and conditions of the charterparty including
                        <em>payment of any amounts due by the Charterers whether by
                        way of hire, freight, damages or otherwise</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is not disputed here that the defendant has
                    issued a letter of demand on the guarantor. Once the first plaintiff’s
                    debt to the defendant remains outstanding this unpaid debt becomes the basis of
                    the guarantor’s liability under the terms of the guarantee. A statutory
                    demand against the second plaintiff in these circumstances is not enforcing an
                    arbitration award against a third party guarantor. Indeed the statutory demand
                    against the second plaintiff is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a result of breaches on the part of the Charterers and/or their failure
                        to pay hire and all other sums due, a sum of <u>US$3,986,157.16</u> as set out below, is now due and owing to

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are instructed that to date the [first plaintiff] have failed to make
                        any payments in relation to this outstanding amount of
                        US$3,986,157.16.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As [the first plaintiff] have not effected payment of the amount due, we
                        hereby demand immediate payment of the sum of <b><u>US$3,986,157.16</u></b> pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee given
                        by yourselves to [the defendant].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On the wording of the statutory demand, the
                    defendant was making a demand on the basis of the first plaintiff’s
                    failure to pay hire and sums due under the hire statements. The reference to the
                    arbitration award was ancillary. The Award did not exclusively form the basis of
                    the defendant’s statutory demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In these circumstances and in the light of the
                    above, I dismiss the plaintiffs’ application to stay or strike out the

                    be agreed or taxed.</p>
