The setting aside applications have not been heard.  This is because the defendants, who succeeded on the question of liability in the award, have applied to strike out the two Originating Summonses on the grounds that the setting aside applications were filed out of time.  These striking out applications form the subject matter of this decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The two Originating Summonses were filed almost six months after the plaintiffs received the arbitral award.   The plaintiffs argue that they acted within time because one of the plaintiffs had made requests for an interpretation and correction of the award, and their setting aside applications were made within three months of the arbitral tribunal’s disposal of those requests.  The defendants, however, are of the view that, following the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in its recent decision in <span class="font-italic">BRS v BRQ and another and another appeal </span>[2021] 1 SLR 390 (“<span class="font-italic">BRS (CA)</span>”), no valid request was made for an interpretation or correction of the award; hence, time for applying to set aside the arbitral award was never extended.

In that case, the plaintiff (the party seeking to set aside the arbitral award) had relied on a request for correction of the award under Art 33 of the Model Law to file its setting aside application based on the extended timelines in Art 34(3).  The plaintiff argued that the court should not be concerned with whether a correction request was in substance one that fell within Art 33.  Rather, as long as there was a request that was described as one seeking a correction under Art 33, that would be sufficient to extend the time for the making of a setting aside application under Art 34(3) of the Model Law.  On the other hand, the defendants, who were resisting the setting aside application, contended that the court ought to look at the substance of the request and determine if it was one that really fell within Art 33.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The High Court, in its decision in <span class="font-italic">BRS and another v BRQ and another and another matter</span> [2019] SGHC 260 (“<span class="font-italic">BRS</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”), agreed with the plaintiff.  In a nutshell, the High Court declined to apply a qualitative test in considering whether a request made under Art 33 of the Model Law actually fell within the ambit of that article.  Instead, the judge thus accepted that as long as there was a correction request that was framed as one under Art 33, time for making the setting aside application would be extended (at [44]–[50]).  The defendants appealed.  The critical issue on appeal was what the phrase “a request had been made under Art 33” in Art 34(3) of the Model Law meant – did it require the court to undertake an examination of whether the request was genuinely one that fell within Art 33?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in <span class="font-italic">BRS (CA)</span> on 29 October 2020.  Notably, this was over a month after the expiry of the initial three-month time limit from the time that CNA, CND and CNE received the Partial Award on 26 June 2020.  In its judgment, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court and overturned <span class="font-italic">BRS (HC)</span>.  The Court of Appeal held that <span class="font-italic">the substance of a request</span> under Art 33 must come within the scope of that article before it can have the effect of extending the time limit under Art 34(3) (at [64]–[72]).  Put another way, the Court of Appeal’s view was that a request that complied with Art 33 only <span class="font-italic">in form</span> would not suffice to qualify to extend time under Art 34(3).  Instead, the court will consider the substance of the request to determine if it indeed fell within Art 33.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The defendants argue that CNA’s Application did <span class="font-italic">not</span> contain, in substance, requests that fell under Art 33 of the Model Law, and hence, the time for making the setting aside applications was not extended.

</div>  This is supported by the views of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Republic of India v Vedanta Resources plc</span> [2021] SGCA 50 at [50], affirming the observations of the High Court below in that matter:<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 Finally, we note that as disclosure orders are interlocutory in nature, the appellant was, and continues to be, at liberty to reapply to the Vedanta Tribunal for reconsideration of the VPOs. This was similarly observed by the Judge at [48]–[49] of the GD:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 So where does that leave a procedural order? A procedural order (as opposed to an award) is not final and may be reconsidered and revised by a tribunal <span class="font-italic">but</span> cannot be nullified by a court. This is not a contradiction. This is merely an aspect of the tribunal being the exclusive master of its own procedure …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 Does this mean that a party may repeatedly ask a tribunal to reconsider and revise its procedural orders? In theory yes. As the cases make clear, until the tribunal issues its final award and becomes <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>, it has the jurisdiction to reconsider and revise earlier procedural orders. And a party does nothing wrong by inviting a tribunal to do so. It is simply invoking another facet of the tribunal’s mastery of its own procedure.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 When the tribunal makes a decision on a request for the interpretation or correction of an arbitral award, that is not a decision that can be revisited by the tribunal at some later stage of the proceedings.  In fact, the tribunal is already <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> in respect of the issues on liability on the issuance of the Partial Award; Art 33 of the Model Law merely provides a limited exception to the end of the arbitral tribunal’s mandate, by permitting the tribunal to make corrections of the type described in Art 33(1), and or providing an interpretation of any specific portion of the award.  Once the tribunal renders its decision on the Art 33(1) request, there is no further exception provided in the Model Law or the ICC Arbitration Rules for it to re-examine or re-consider its decision on the request.  In that sense, its mandate in respect of issues of liability has, in all respects, come to an end. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As for whether the decision by the tribunal appears on its face to be a procedural order, that can hardly be determinative of the issue.  While the decision by the tribunal is not detailed in setting out its reasons for rejecting the two requests, I note that the decision had to be scrutinised by the ICC Court before it was issued.  Also, under Art 36(4) of the ICC Arbitration Rules of 2017, any decision to correct or to interpret the Partial Award has to take the form of an addendum to the Partial Award, and will constitute part of the Partial Award.  That being so, I find that the process governing the making of any correction or the giving of any interpretation of the award under Art 36 of the ICC Arbitration Rules makes it clear that the decision by the arbitral tribunal on the request cannot be regarded as a mere procedural order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The request for an interpretation of sub-para 598(4) of the Partial Award </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The defendants point out

Hence, even if a tribunal, on the face of the award, quite clearly misunderstood or overlooked some critical provision of the parties’ agreement or some essential piece of evidence, the remedy is not generally a correction of the award under Art 33, but rather an application to set aside the award or the relevant portion of the award: <span class="font-italic">Born </span>at p 3384.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The plaintiffs argue that the wording of Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law simply encapsulates what is commonly referred to in court proceedings law as the “slip rule”, which allows clerical rectifications of accidental slips or omissions.

What is critical, however, is that, at the oral closing arguments before the tribunal, <span class="font-italic">after</span> the post-hearing briefs were submitted, the issue was clarified by the counsel for CNB and CNC when he was questioned by the tribunal as to legal basis for seeking this relief for an account of profits against CNA.

</div>
</div>  Hence, regardless of what had been stated in the various documents submitted earlier, the final position of CNB and CNC in the arbitral proceedings, insofar as liability was concerned, was that they were <span class="font-italic">not</span> pursuing an order for an account of profits against CNA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Given the circumstances, I think that CNA could hardly be faulted for being somewhat surprised by the tribunal’s order at sub-para 598(10) of the Partial Award.  As counsel for CNA points out, other than at that sub-paragraph in the dispositive section of the Partial Award, the only other place in the Partial Award where there is any mention of “an account of profits” is where the tribunal sets out the reliefs <span class="font-italic">being sought by </span><span class="font-italic">CNB/CNC</span> (in particular, at para 55).  There is nothing in the Partial Award which sets out, even briefly, any analysis as to why an account of profits is being ordered.  Indeed, as noted above, CNB and CNC had confirmed that they were not seeking an account of profits.  Therefore, I agree with counsel for CNA that it would have appeared to CNA, when it received the Partial Award, that the tribunal made a mistake in the following manner: after setting out the reliefs sought by CNB/CNC in its post-hearing briefs, the tribunal omitted to mention that CNB/CNC had abandoned their claim to an account of profits against CNA as confirmed by counsel during the oral closing submissions; this led to the inclusion of an order for an account of profits against CNA at sub-para 598(10), after the tribunal had discussed and set out their findings on liability of CNA, CND and CNE.  According to the plaintiffs, this appeared to be a mistake by the tribunal, or a “slip”, and is a correctable error under Art 33(1) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The defendants’ response to this is that, even if the tribunal had possibly made a mistake in inadvertently making an order for CNA to account for profits, this was not the type of error that was correctable under Art 33(1) of the Model Law.  This is because this was an error in the “thought process” of the tribunal, and not in the “expression of their thought”.

</div>  What counsel for the defendants was conveying by this expression, I understand, is that this was <span class="font-italic">not</span> an error in “computation”, which obviously means a mistake in arithmetic, or a “clerical or typographical” error, or any error of “a similar nature”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I agree with counsel for the defendants that this specific language in Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law, and also in Art 36(1) of the ICC Arbitration Rules, indicates that the intention is for Art 33(1) of the Model Law to be read in a circumscribed manner.  In my view, the starting point in the analysis must be this language used in the article, and not cases on the “slip rule”, which is a rule of common law dealing with court proceedings.  This is regardless of whether Art 33(1) of the Model Law is intended to be coextensive in scope with the “slip rule”, which itself was a point that counsel hotly contested before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The possible mistake by the tribunal in including an order for CNA to account for profits was quite obviously not a computational error.  There was no arithmetic calculation involved here.  It was also clearly not a typographical error, which usually refers to errors of expression, spelling mistakes, errors in references, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.  There was some suggestion that it might have been a clerical error of some sort, when the tribunal copied over para 55 of its Partial Award to the dispositive section at para 598, but forgot to delete the relief of “an account of profits” against CNA.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The question that then arises is whether the possible mistake by the tribunal in inadvertently including an account of profits against CNA can be described as an error “of similar nature”.  The well-established principle of construction that would be applicable here is the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis</span> rule, whereby wide words associated in the text with more limited words are taken to be restricted by implication to matters of the same limited character. In applying the <span class="font-italic">ejusdem generis </span>rule, it is crucial to identify the “genus” or common thread running through the words, which may be ascertained by identifying some common and dominant feature of the limited words: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lam </span><span class="font-italic">Leng Hung and others </span>[2018] 1 SLR 659 at [105]–[121].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the case of Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the wide words “any errors of similar nature” should be read in light of the character of the more narrowly named “errors in computation” and “clerical or typographical errors”. In my view, what characterises these specifically enumerated types of errors is that they are all errors in the nature of inadvertent acts or omissions by the arbitral tribunal, which if corrected, do not affect the substance of what the tribunal <span class="font-italic">intended</span> to decide.  That being the case, I am prepared to accept that, if a party had conveyed to the tribunal that it was abandoning its claim for a specific relief in the course of the closing submissions, but the tribunal had not noted this in the award, and then proceeded to grant that relief mistakenly, that would be an error that would fall within Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).  It would be an error that is similar to a computational, clerical or typographical error, because the tribunal would not have granted such an order, had it remembered that the specific prayer for relief had been expressly abandoned by the claimant.  I would think that an arbitral tribunal must be presumed to intend to act within the scope of its mandate, and to not deliberately act beyond that scope.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this case, I find that the possible mistake by the tribunal was one that was potentially correctable under Art 33(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Model Law and Art 36(1) of the ICC Arbitration Rules.  Therefore, I find that there was a proper basis for CNA to have made a request to the tribunal to correct the error by asking for the deletion of the order for an account of profits on the basis that it might been “framed mistakenly”.  I see no reason a correction cannot include a deletion, if it is something that the tribunal had inadvertently stated, and would have been removed if the tribunal’s attention had been brought to that error before the issuance of the Partial Award.  I must add that, in coming to this conclusion, I have followed <span class="font-italic">BRS (CA)</span> in not considering the reasons given by the tribunal for rejecting CNA’s request for the correction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Finally, I should add that, while the defendants’ counsel drew my attention to the use of the phrase “excess of the tribunal’s mandate” in CNA’s Application and submitted that complaints about the tribunal’s excess of mandate should properly be the subject of an application to set aside the Partial Award, I accept the point raised by counsel for CNA that an “excess of mandate” would arise even if the tribunal had made a genuine mistake as to the scope of CNB/CNC’s claims and what they were seeking in terms of their remedies.  Hence, it was not inaccurate to describe the granting of the order for an account of profits against CNA as something which was “in excess” of the tribunal’s mandate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether CNA’s Application extended the timeline for CND and CNE to make their application to set aside the Partial Award</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendants’ submission here is that CND and CNE should not be allowed to “piggy back” on CNA’s Application.  Since they did not themselves seek any interpretation or correction of the Partial Award, it is argued that there was nothing that prevented them from filing their application to set aside the Partial Award within the three-month time limit as set out in Art 34(3) of the Model Law.  As such, regardless of the court’s decision on whether CNA was within time in making its setting aside application, the defendant contends that CND and CNE are clearly out of time in filing their setting aside application, and OS 1306 should be struck out.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I am not able to accept this submission.  Again, the starting point in the analysis is the text under in the article.  The words used in Art 34(3) requires close examination.  It provides that the application for setting aside may not be made after three months has elapsed from the date “on which the party making that application had received the award or, if <span class="font-italic">a request</span> <span class="font-italic">had been made under </span><span class="font-italic">Article 33</span>, from the date on which that request had been disposed of” (emphasis added).  As a matter of interpretation, the use of the words “a request had been made under Article 33” is critical.  The drafters would have inserted the underlined words “a request <span class="font-underline">by that party</span> had been made” if the intention was that time would be extended for a party only if the request was one made by <span class="font-italic">that</span><span class="font-italic"> party</span> making the application to set aside the award.  However, the use of the words “a request”, without specifying which party made that request, indicates to me that a request by <span class="font-italic">any</span> party to the arbitration would extend the time for <span class="font-italic">all</span> parties to make their application to set aside the award.  Of course, this is all predicated on there being a request being made that properly falls within the ambit of Art 33(1), and, in this case, I have already found that CNA’s correction request does fall within that article. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I also agree with the submission by counsel for CND and CNE that, until a decision is made by the tribunal on the request for an interpretation or correction, there is uncertainty as to the precise content of the award.

</div>
</div>  In other words, the award is not truly final, until the request is decided by the arbitral tribunal.  This follows from the fact that under Art 33(1) of the Model Law and Art 36(3) of the ICC Arbitration Rules, the interpretation forms part of the award.  That being so, as a matter of policy, it makes perfect sense that all parties who intend to make a setting aside application should be given the extended timeline to do so.  Otherwise, one is faced with the possibility that there may be different applications to set aside different versions of the arbitral award, one which has been corrected, and one which has not.  Two different sets of timelines would provide an unnecessary complexity to the process of setting aside.  That appears to me unprincipled, impractical and undesirable.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 On the facts of this case, CNA’s Application – in particular, the request for a correction of the order for CNA to account for its profits – had a potential impact on CND and CNE.  That is because all three respondents were held by the tribunal to be jointly and severally liable for the account of profits.  Further, any decision by the tribunal to correct the Partial Award would have bound all the parties to the award.  As such, in that sense, it is quite irrelevant that CND and CNE might have thought that the Partial Award was clear on its terms, or that there was no need for any correction.  If the defendants are right in their contention on this issue, and there are two separate timelines, then it would mean that, despite being bound by any correction, CND and CNE would have lost the right to challenge the Partial Award, even if it had been corrected.  Indeed, if the defendants’ contention is correct, CND and CNE would have had to make their setting aside application within three months of receipt of the original award, without knowing the impact, if any, of CNA’s request for correction on that award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As such, I was unable to accept the defendants’ submission that time for the making of the setting aside application was not extended for CND and CNE as a result of CNA’s Application, given that CNA’s correction request fell within the scope of Art 33(1) of the Model Law.  It follows from this that I do not agree that CND and CNE were out of time in making their application to set aside the Partial Award in OS 1306.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For the reasons given above, I find that the plaintiffs were not time-barred from making their applications to set aside the Partial Award.  In the case of CNA, while I agreed that the request for an interpretation was not, in substance, one that fell within Art 33(1) of the Model Law, the request for a correction was.  As such, CNA’s Application was one that extended the timelines for the three plaintiffs to make their setting aside applications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I dismiss SUM 288/2021 and SUM 289/2021.
