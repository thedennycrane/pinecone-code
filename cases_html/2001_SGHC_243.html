<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">BACKGROUND</p>
<p></p></b></i>1.        The Defendant Wei Sin Construction

Pte Ltd (‘Wei Sin’) is the main contractor of two projects by the Housing and

Development Board (‘HDB’) at Jurong West. The contracts are known as

Neighbourhood 2 Contract 6 and Neighbourhood 6 Contract 28. I will refer to them as the N2

contract and the N6 contract respectively and the neighbourhoods as N2 and N6

respectively. 

<p xmlns="">2.        At all material times the Plaintiff AL

Stainless Industries Pte Ltd (‘AL’) was the sub-contractor of Wei Sin for the

supply, delivery and installation of metal work in respect of the N2 and the N6 contracts.

</p>
<p xmlns="">3.        The letters of award from Wei Sin to AL

for the sub-contracts were each dated 15 March 1999. They incorporated, inter alia,

attached Standard Conditions of Contract for Supply and Install Sub-Contract (‘the

Standard Conditions’). Each letter of award was accepted by AL on or about 20 April

1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.        The initial sub-contract sum in respect of

N2 was $450,291.19. The additional sum for variation and for any item not previously

priced was $205,857.86. The total sub-contract sum for N2 was therefore $656,149.05.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.        The initial sub-contract sum in respect of

N6 was $509,241.39. The additional sum for variation and for any item not previously

priced was $68,678. The total sub-contract sum for N6 was therefore $577,919.39.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.        In due course, AL submitted progress

claims for payment. Wei Sin was often late in payment and also did not pay the entire sums

claimed. As a result, AL was chasing for payments to be made.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.        In the meantime, Wei Sin alleged that that

there was delay in AL’s works and also defects.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.        Eventually, AL’s solicitors B T Tan

&amp; Company (‘B T Tan &amp; Co’) sent a fax dated 4 September 1999 to Wei Sin

on both the sub-contracts to allege that Wei Sin was in breach of contract and to require

that arrears in payment under both contracts be paid in full by 9 September 1999, failing

which AL would terminate the sub-contracts.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.        In response, Harry Elias Partnership

(‘HEP’), who were the then solicitors of Wei Sin, replied on 10 September 1999

to deny any breach by Wei Sin. They alleged severe delay and numerous defects in AL’s

work and purported to terminate the two sub-contracts under Clause 7(a), (b) and (c) of

the Standard Conditions.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.        B T Tan &amp; Co then replied also on 10

September 1999 to, in turn, purportedly terminate the two sub-contracts.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.        I will refer to these three faxes in

greater detail later.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.        AL then commenced this action to claim

the payments that AL said were due to it under the two sub-contracts for work done and

damages for Wei Sin’s repudiation of both contracts. At trial, Mr Winston Quek for AL

said the claim for damages was for loss of profit.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.        The trial proceeded on the basis that AL

would attempt to prove its claim for the amounts that should be paid to it for work done.

If it is entitled to claim damages for repudiation, such damages would be assessed.

AL’s request was for assessment to be done by a registrar.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.        Wei Sin in turn counter-claimed that it

was entitled to terminate the sub-contracts and did so by HEP’s fax. Wei Sin claimed

damages all of which were to be assessed. Wei Sin wanted the question as to who was to

assess the damages to be left open until after liability was determined.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.        Wei Sin’s main claims were for

having to engage other sub-contractors (a) to do the outstanding work and (b) to rectify

AL’s defective work. Another main claim by Wei Sin was for liquidated damages against

AL for alleged delay by AL in carrying out its works in each of N2 and N6.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.        Lastly, Wei Sin claimed various sums for

other items which I shall deal with later.</p>

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">AL’S CLAIMS FOR WORK DONE (N2 AND N6)</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">20.        It was not disputed that AL was entitled

to be paid a further sum for each of the sub-contracts for work done. The issue was how

much more for each of the sub-contracts.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.        Although the allegations of AL about

under-payment and late payment of its progress claims will be more directly material to

the question as to whether Wei Sin was in repudiatory breach of contract, I will deal with

them here as this will provide a back-drop to AL’s claims for work done.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Clause 4 of the letter of award</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">22.        Under each of the letters of award, the

terms of payment were: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘4. TERM OF PAYMENT</p>
<p align="justify">Term of payment shall be monthly. Progress claim shall be submitted to

    us before the 25<sup>th</sup> of each month. There will be a retention of 5% on the value

    Maintenance Certificate. <u>We reserve the right to deduct any monies that is due to us</u>.’</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">23.        Mr Nishith Shetty for Wei Sin submitted

that the last sentence of Clause 4 allowed Wei Sin to deduct any amount that Wei Sin might

claim to be due to it from AL over and above the 5% retention sum.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.        The Interpretation of Contracts, Second

Edition, by Kim Lewison states at p 245 and 246: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘

                                             INTERNAL

    INCONSISTENCY</p>
<p align="justify">If a clause in a contract is followed by a later clause which destroys

    the effect of the first clause, the later clause is to be rejected as repugnant and the

    earlier clause prevails. If, however, the later clause can be read as qualifying rather

    than destroying the effect of the earlier clause, then the two are to be read together,

    and effect given to both.</p>
<p align="justify">It often happens that two clauses in a contract are found to be in some

    measure inconsistent. This is particularly the case where the contract is based upon a

    standard form which the parties have not negotiated to which special clauses or conditions

    have been added. In such circumstances the court has developed a number of principles for

    dealing with the inconsistency. Provisions are inconsistent if they cannot sensibly be

    read together. </p>
<p align="justify">In <i>Walker v. Giles</i>, Wilde C.J. said:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"And as the different parts of the deed are inconsistent with each

      other, the question is, to which part effect ought to be given. There is no doubt, that,

      applying the approved rules of construction to this instrument, effect ought to be given

      to that part which is calculated to carry into effect the real intention, and that part

      which would defeat it should be rejected."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">As a statement of general principle that cannot be criticised. However,

    it is not of great assistance in determining how to ascertain the real intention to which

    effect must be given. A more specific principle was described in <i>Forbes v. Git</i>, in

    which Lord Wrenbury said:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The principle of law to be applied may be stated in a few words.

      If in a deed an earlier clause is followed by a later clause which destroys altogether the

      obligation created by the earlier clause, the later clause is to be rejected as repugnant

      and the earlier clause prevails. In this case the two clauses cannot be reconciled and the

      earlier provision in the deed prevails over the later. Thus if A covenants to pay 100

      and the deed subsequently provides that he shall not be liable under his covenant, that

      later provision is to be rejected as repugnant and void, for it altogether destroys the

      covenant. But if the later clause does not destroy but only qualifies the earlier, then

      the two are to be read together and effect is to be given to the intention of the parties

      as disclosed by the deed as a whole. Thus if A covenants to pay 100 and the deed

      subsequently provides that he shall be liable to pay only at a future named date or in a

      future defined event or if at the due date of payment he holds a defined office, then the

      absolute covenant to pay is controlled by the words qualifying the obligation in manner

      described."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">….</p>
<p align="justify">It should be noted that a contrary rule applies to the construction of

    wills. In the case of inconsistency between two provisions in a will, the later provision

    prevails. ….</p>
<p align="justify">The contract may, however, itself indicate which of two inconsistent

    clauses is to prevail. …’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">25.        If Mr Shetty’s interpretation of the

last sentence of Clause 4 is correct, it would destroy the 5% limit. The last sentence

should therefore be rejected as being repugnant to the 5% limit. </p>
<p xmlns="">26.        However, Mr Shetty also ran his argument

in another way. He argued that the 5% retention sum was for latent defects whereas the

last sentence of Clause 4 was to cover patent defects. I do not agree. If the defects were

patent, then that would have been taken into account by Wei Sin when Wei Sin was valuing

each progress claim by AL. Wei Sin is not entitled to make a further deduction for patent

defects on top of its own valuation.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.        Thirdly, if there is any ambiguity about

Clause 4, then under the contra proferentem rule, the ambiguity would be resolved against

the party who drafted the provision i.e Wei Sin.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.        Accordingly, I am of the view that the

last sentence of Clause 4 has no effect. Alternatively, at most, it will allow Wei Sin to

deduct any sum over and above the 5% retention sum provided the deduction is to meet a

liability that is already due from AL to Wei Sin either by admission or by judgment. </p>
<p xmlns="">29.        In any event, whatever rights that Wei

Sin may have under Clause 4 must be exercised bona fide and not capriciously.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Common law right of set-off</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">30.        Mr Shetty also submitted that Wei Sin had

a common law right of set-off so long as this right was not excluded by contract.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.        Hudson’s Building &amp; Engineering

Contracts 1995, Eleventh Edition, states at p 623: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘Payment obligations are, in many international and some

    producer-influenced domestic construction contracts, enforceable by express

    contractor’s termination provisions, usually conditioned upon A/E certification of

    interim payments due. Even in those cases, however, <i>a fortiori</i> if no termination

    provision is present, the possibility of valid deductions or set-off, whether expressly

    contemplated or permitted by the contract or not, must be borne in mind by a party

    contemplating termination or rescission. Only express wording can serve to exclude the

    right to set-off, and this will apply equally whether the remedy sought is a common law

    rescission or a contractual termination for non-payment of certified sums, so that even

    contractual terminations by contractors supported by certificates may be perilous if the

    owner is able to establish a set-off against sums certified or due.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">32.    However, the next para states: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘However, in these cases, set-off will need to represent <u>a bona

    fide known present loss or entitlement by the deducting party, it is submitted, and not

    some possible or even likely future loss</u>, if non-payment is to be justified and

    termination avoided in these situations. It will certainly not invalidate a termination

    for non-payment, whether at common law or under a contractual provision, if the set-off

    was unknown to the defaulting payer at the time, since such a set-off could not displace

    the intention not to be bound by the contract, which is the essential test in deciding the

    validity of such a common law rescission or interpreting a contractual termination power,

    it is submitted. <u>Nor will it justify a deduction for anticipated further liquidated or

    other damages for delay made by an owner before expiry of the contract or extended

    contract period, it is submitted</u>.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">33.        Accordingly, one of the key requirements

to this right of set-off is that it must be exercised bona fide and even Mr Shetty

accepted this in para 75 of his Closing Submission.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">How AL’s progress claims were valued</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">34.        The valuation of AL’s progress

claims was done by quantity surveyors employed by Wei Sin. For N2, the quantity surveyor

was Daniel Chong and for N6 it was Sim Poh Chuan. I will refer to the quantity surveyor as

‘the QS’. Neither QS was called by Wei Sin to give evidence.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.        No explanation was given as to why Daniel

Chong was not called to give evidence for Wei Sin.</p>
<p xmlns="">36.        As for Sim Poh Chuan, DW2 Mr Soh said he

was no longer employed by Wei Sin. However, this does not justify the omission to call him

as a witness. If a person is a material witness then he should be contacted and be asked

to provide material evidence. There was no suggestion of any difficulty in contacting him

or in obtaining his assistance.</p>
<p xmlns="">37.        Instead of calling either QS to give

evidence for it, Wei Sin called DW3 Mr Poon.</p>
<p xmlns="">38.        Mr Poon is a Senior Contracts Manager of

Wei Sin. He said that he is in charge of all the quantity surveyors employed by Wei Sin.

They report to him on various matters including certification of payment for

sub-contractors (NE 173 line 10 to 14).</p>
<p xmlns="">39.        His evidence at NE 174 line 4 to 175 Line

5 was: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘Q        Please explain why

    there is a difference between this sum at D2-5 and $23,248.35 at D2-4?</p>
<p align="justify">A         Refer to D2-6. Total

    value of work done is $34,428.80. Retention is $1,700. He [the QS] deducted previous

    payment of $6,555. This gave a sub-total of $25,745. Add GST of $722.35 it becomes

    $26,517.35.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">That was the recommendation he made to the Defendants’ Project

    Manager and Project Director who were Ng Boon Hoo and Mr Soh Eng Chong respectively.</p>
<p align="justify">The practice in Defendants is that all the quantity surveyors are

    stationed at head office. They are handling not only one job but maybe 2 or 3 jobs

    concurrently. Because of that situation, the submission of claims by sub-contractors by 25<sup>th</sup>

    of each month becomes very important for quantity surveyors. Upon collection of

    sub-contractors’ claim by 25<sup>th</sup> of the month, the QS then goes down to the

    respective site which he must do by 30<sup>th</sup> of the month. His visit to the site is

    2 fold. Firstly it is to assess the status of the work for submission of claims to the

    clients like HDB. Secondly he will be assessing the sub-contractors’ claim. Both of

    these functions will be done for each project in the same one day. Therefore whatever he

    recommends is limited to what he has seen. With that in mind, he does his assessment on a

    broad basis, recording only the general status of work done. He goes back to office and

    comes up with computation as shown in D2-5 and 6. He will then take them to the Project

    Manager and Project Director for further discussion. Because of that, there may be

    additions or omissions to his recommendation. With that he will come up with Progress

    Payment certificate as in D2-4 and it is processed by accounts department. At the same

    time, the QS will get the recommendation by the Contracts Manager and approval by one of

    the directors. Someone has to check the quantification is alright and approval is by a

    director.’ </p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">40.        In summary, Mr Poon was saying that the

QS’s assessment and subsequent recommendation was based on the QS’s limited site

attendance and it was the Project Manager and Project Director for the relevant project,

who had more intimate knowledge of the project, who would make adjustments to the

QS’s recommendation. The QS would then prepare the Progress Payment certificate,

payment would be recommended by the Contracts Manager and approved by one of the directors

(on the board of directors).</p>

recommendation was amended by the QS by about $17,000. As I will elaborate below, this was

done on the instruction of a Project Director.</p>

<p xmlns="">50.        It is clear to me that Wei Sin had

decided to cut down on the figures recommended by its own QS not because the QS had been

unaware of the incomplete work or defects or because Mr Soh had more intimate knowledge of

the works of AL. It was simply because Wei Sin wanted to pay a lower sum to AL because of

some general concern about slow work and defects.</p>
<p xmlns="">51.        Neither Mr Soh or anyone else in Wei Sin

had gone into any detailed discussion with the QS on his valuations to reach the lower

figures. The lower figures which Wei Sin had decided for payment were therefore arrived at

<p xmlns="">55.        It can be seen from the above tabulations

that Wei Sin was often late in making payment, except for Progress Claim No 2 for N6. This

was paid ‘early’ but only because AL had re-submitted an amended claim after 25

May 1999. Wei Sin took advantage of this and treated it as having been made for June 1999

whereupon the due date for payment became 25 July 1999 instead.</p>
<p xmlns="">56.        It can also be seen that Progress Claims

No 3, 4A and 5A under N2 and Progress Claim No 4 and 5A under N6 were not paid at all. In

fairness, I should mention that as at the date of purported termination i.e 10 September

1999, only Progress Claim No 3 for N2 and No 4 for N6 were due for payment. However, even

though the others were not due for payment yet, they subsequently became due but were not

paid.</p>
<p xmlns="">57.        As regards Progress Claim No 5A, Mr

Shetty said that his instructions were that Wei Sin did not receive it for each of the

sub-contracts until after the action was commenced (para 5 of the Defence and Counterclaim

refers wrongly to Progress Claim No 5). However, he did not question PW1 Mr Sim about No

5A. While DW2 Mr Soh had alleged in his AEIC that the last progress claims dated 30 August

1999 (i.e No 5A) for each of the sub-contracts was not even forwarded to Wei Sin prior to

the action, he did not elaborate as to when they were received.</p>
<p xmlns="">58.        Besides, in evidence, Wei Sin did not

dispute receiving Progress Claim No 5 for each of the sub-contracts. Each of the Progress

Claims No 5A is not significantly different from No 5 in dollar value.</p>
<p xmlns="">59.        Furthermore, I note that when B T Tan

&amp; Co sent its fax demand dated 4 September 1999, it referred to five progress claims

for each sub-contract, the last ones being numbered ‘5’ in its letter. The error

is repeated in the Statement of Claim. However, from the date and the amount of each of

the fifth claims, it seems to me that B T Tan &amp; Co’s reference for that claim

should actually be to 5A and not 5.</p>
<p xmlns="">60.        Also, when HEP replied, HEP did not

dispute that Wei Sin had received five progress claims from AL for each sub-contract.

Neither did HEP say that the amounts claimed were incorrectly stated by B T Tan &amp; Co.</p>
<p xmlns="">61.        As for the differences between AL’s

progress claims and the payments by Wei Sin, the differences were larger for N2.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Did Wei Sin agree on 11 August 1999 to make some payment to AL <u>for

N2</u>? If so, why was the payment withheld?</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">62.        As can be seen from the above tabulation

at para 54, as at 11 August 1999, Wei Sin had paid AL less than half of what AL had

claimed for N2. I also stress that although Wei Sin had made three payments for N2, there

was no payment in respect of Progress Claim No 3 contrary to the assertion in para 142 of

Mr Shetty’s Closing Submission. Although AL’s statement of account (at BAEIC 49)

and PW1 Mr Sim had assumed that the third payment from Wei Sin was for Progress Claim No

3, the fact of the matter is that the third payment was in respect of Progress Claim No 2

as was the second payment. This is evident from the documentary evidence i.e Progress

Payment No 2 (at BAEIC 156) which was confirmed by DW2 Mr Soh during cross-examination

(see NE 163 line 14 to NE 164 line 11). That is why I grouped the second and third

payments as payments for Progress Claim No 2 in the tabulation for N2 at para 54 above.</p>
<p xmlns="">63.        On 11 August 1999, there was a meeting

between PW1 Mr Sim, representing AL and Lawrence Soh (the CEO of Wei Sin), Steven Soh,

Mark Koh and one Ms L F Yip representing Wei Sin. I was informed that DW2 is also known as

Steven Soh.</p>
<p xmlns="">64.        Mr Sim alleged that at this meeting,

Lawrence Soh had agreed to pay AL $90,000 for Progress Claim No 3 within the next one or

two days. However when AL did not receive such payment, he contacted Mr Soh’s office

and spoke to Ms Yip who informed him that the figure would be $70,000. The $70,000 would

be paid between 16 to 25 August 1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">65.        According to DW2 Mr Soh, Wei Sin did not

agree to pay AL $90,000 but only $70,000 and this payment would be made between 16 and 25

August 1999. However, he also said that Wei Sin did not pay the $90,000 (which had been

recommended by the QS for N2 Progress Claim No 3, see para 41 above) because Wei Sin

wanted to make provision for liquidated damages for AL’s delay in N2.</p>
<p xmlns="">66.        In the context of Progress Claim No 4, he

gave additional reasons. He said that Wei Sin had to take into account the additional

costs of rectifying defects and completing outstanding work, if AL did not do these works

(NE 155 line 12 to 157 line 23). Progress Payment No 4A was not due for payment until 25

September 1999 (NE 158 line 5 to line 16).</p>
<p xmlns="">67.        The faxes on the subject are stated

</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">72.        Then on 18 August 1999, Wei Sin sent a

fax to AL’s Mr Sim (BAEIC 335 to 336). It complained about slow progress of works for

N2 and for N6. The penultimate paragraph states: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘As our projects are been delayed by you (and may suffer

    liquidated damages as a result) and the higher cost of completing your outstanding work,

    the outstanding payment of $90,000.00 will be withhold until the project is

    completed.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">73.        Having considered the oral and the

documentary evidence, I find that Wei Sin did agree on 11 August 1999 to pay AL $90,000

and AL was to be informed in one or two days as to when it could collect payment.</p>
<p xmlns="">74.        This was not a situation where Wei Sin

would inform AL within one or two days as to how much Wei Sin would pay as was suggested

by Mr Shetty during cross-examination of Mr Sim.</p>
<p xmlns="">75.        Wei Sin then changed its mind and on or

about 14 August 1999, informed AL that it would pay $70,000, instead of $90,000, and this

would be paid between 16 and 25 August 1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">76.        Wei Sin then changed its mind again and

decided to withhold payment even of the $70,000 primarily because of its concern about the

slow progress of work by AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">77.        However, Wei Sin did not adduce any

evidence as to just how much AL’s works in N2 had delayed the main contract works as

at 18 August 1999, or even thereafter up to 10 September 1999 (which is the date of

termination of the sub-contracts).</p>
<p xmlns="">78.        Neither did it adduce any evidence as to

its own assessment <u>at the material time</u> of the costs of rectifying defects for N2.</p>
<p xmlns="">79.        It is clear to me that, again, Wei Sin

had acted in an arbitrary manner in withholding payment for N2 Progress Claim No 3 which

was already due to be paid by 25 July 1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">80.        I would add that the agreement on 11

August 1999 and Wei Sin’s failure to pay the $90,000, or even the $70,000, might have

provided AL with a separate defence to any allegation of slow progress of work or of

failure to rectify defective work for N2 subsequent to 11 August 1999. However, as this

was not pleaded as a separate defence, I need not say anything more about it.</p>
<p xmlns="">81.        I have already mentioned, in the earlier

part of my judgment, the fax demand sent by AL’s solicitors B T Tan &amp; Co dated 4

September 1999, the purported termination of the sub-contracts for N2 and N6 by Wei

Sin’s solicitors HEP on 10 September 1999 and the purported termination of the

sub-contracts for N2 and N6 by B T Tan &amp; Co on 10 September 1999 (see paras 8, 9 and

10 above).</p>
<p xmlns="">82.        I will elaborate on the fax demand and

each of the purported notices of termination later. Suffice it to say for now, that, by 10

September 1999, the sub-contracts for N2 and N6 were terminated.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The amount to be paid to AL for N2 and N6</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">83.        Leaving aside the counter-claims of Wei

Sin for the time being, it was clear that AL was entitled to further payment.</p>
<p xmlns="">84.        Indeed, Wei Sin conceded the following: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    For N2, the 95% payment to AL should be

    $307,604.99 (including GST) although AL claimed $389,876.28. As AL has received

    $91,705.02, AL is entitled to be paid at least another $215,899.97.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    For N6, the 95% payment to AL should be

    $103,474.50 (including GST), although AL claimed $146,838.87. As AL has received

    $47,946.50, AL is entitled to be paid at least another $55,528.</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">85.        On the differences, AL relied on the

details forwarded with its progress claims which were attached to the AEIC of Mr Sim and

the evidence of PW2 Mr Teo, its expert witness. However, Mr Teo did not go to the site to

check the actual work done and his evidence was really a commentary on the valuations

done.</p>
<p xmlns="">86.        As for Wei Sin, it relied on the evidence

of DW2 Mr Poon. It will be recalled that he is a Senior Manager (Contracts) of Wei Sin. He

is in charge of all the quantity surveyors of Wei Sin but he was not the quantity surveyor

who did the valuations for N2 and for N6.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">N2 – 1<sup>st</sup> item of dispute</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">87.        The 1<sup>st</sup> item of dispute for N2

was the barricade railing.</p>
<p xmlns="">88.        In AL’s Progress Claim No 5A, BAEIC

142, items 15 and 16, AL had claimed 70% of 705 metres for this item, i.e 494.2 metres.</p>
<p xmlns="">89.        Mr Poon’s valuation at BAEIC 625,

S/No A item 6, alleged that only 345.8 metres of this item had been done by AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">90.        However, the measurements of Wei Sin for

this item as at 30 July 1999, i.e one month earlier than the date of Progress Claim No 5A,

had already stated the total measurement of barricade railing done by AL to be 423.6

metres, see BAEIC 171 items 6 and 7. This was a point made by Mr Teo at NE 124 line 1 to 4

and he was not challenged on it.</p>
<p xmlns="">91.        Furthermore, when Mr Poon gave evidence

for Wei Sin, he did not explain how it was that Wei Sin had stated the total measurement

for barricade railing to be 423.6 metres at BAEIC 171, items 6 and 7, but yet had come up

with 345.8 metres in his subsequent report at BAEIC 625 item 6.</p>
<p xmlns="">92.        Indeed, he did not give any explanation

as to how he had come up with 345.8 metres for this item.</p>
<p xmlns="">93.        Accordingly, I find that there is no

basis for Wei Sin’s measurement of 345.8 metres which is in any event contradicted by

its earlier measurement of 423.6 metres.</p>
<p xmlns="">94.        In addition, its earlier measurement of

423.6 metres was for work done as at 30 July 1999 and this is not inconsistent with

AL’s claim of 494.2 metres under No 5A which is for work done as at 30 August 1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">95.        Furthermore, Mr Sim who gave evidence for

AL was not challenged on AL’s measurement for this item.</p>
<p xmlns="">96.        Accordingly, I find for AL for this item.

The difference in the respective measurements in BAEIC 625 is 494.2 metres – 345.8

metres = 148.4 metres x $150.45 per metre (which rate is not disputed ) = $22,326.78,

before taking into account the 5% to be retained and GST.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">N2 – 2<sup>nd</sup> item of dispute</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">97.        The 2<sup>nd</sup> item of dispute is the

Air-condition Ledge Railings and Cloth Drying Racks ‘L-shaped’.</p>
<p xmlns="">98.        AL claims that 406 sets were supplied and

installed but Wei Sin alleges that 303.9 sets were installed, see BAEIC 625 S/No A item

18.</p>
<p xmlns="">99.        While DW3 Mr Poon accepted that 406 sets

were installed by AL, he alleged that the sets installed were not complete. He said that

each set was made up of three parts, i.e: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Part 1 - cow horn</p>
<p align="justify">Part 2 - air-con ledge</p>
<p align="justify">Part 3 - aluminium clothes rack</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">100.        He said that the percentage of work done

for each part was: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Part 1 - 30%</p>
<p align="justify">Part 2 - 45%</p>
<p align="justify">Part 3 - 20%</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">101.        Based on this, he then came up with the

figure of 303.9 sets. Further details are in BAEIC 627 which is part of his report.</p>
<p xmlns="">102.        However, he also said that the quantity

done for each part was told to him. In other words, he had no personal knowledge of the

work done or not done (NE 179 line 11 and 12).</p>
<p xmlns="">103.        In re-examination at NE 187 line 15 to

21, he further said: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘Q     You mentioned you were provided with

    information. Who provided the information?</p>
<p align="justify">A     For N2, Daniel Chong, the QS of the project

    at the material time. Ms Rogelita, the Project Co-ordinator of N2. Soh Eng Chong, the

    Project Director of N2. </p>
<p align="justify">For N6, Daniel Chong, the QS and Soh Eng Chong, the Project Director.</p>
<p align="justify">For the valuations in my affidavit, Daniel Chong and Soh Eng Chong went

    to the site to do physical measurement.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">104.        As I have previously said, Daniel Chong

is the QS for N2 only. The QS for N6 is Sim Poh Chuan. Neither was called to give evidence

on this item or on any other point for that matter. I draw an adverse inference against

Wei Sin for this omission.</p>
<p xmlns="">105.        Ms Rogelita was called to give evidence

as DW1 but not on the valuation of this item.</p>
<p xmlns="">106.        Mr Soh was called to give evidence as

DW2 but also not on the valuation of this item. </p>
<p xmlns="">107.        Furthermore, there was a discrepancy on

Wei Sin’s side. The total number of sets under AL’s sub-contract for N2 for this

item was 518. If only 303.9 sets were supplied and installed by AL, then the remaining

quantity to be supplied and installed by another sub-contractor would be 214.1 sets.</p>
<p xmlns="">108.        However item 3 of BAEIC 630, which is

part of Mr Poon’s own report, shows that the remaining quantity to be supplied and

installed was 112 sets only and not 214.1 sets.</p>
<p xmlns="">109.        The 112 sets tally with AL’s claim

of 406 sets as the two quantities added together make up the 518 sets required under

AL’s sub-contract before termination.</p>
<p xmlns="">110.        Accordingly, I find for AL for this

item. The difference in BAEIC 625 is 406 – 303.9 sets = 102.1 sets x $433.65 per set

(which rate is not disputed) = $44,275.67, before taking into account the 5% to be

retained and GST. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">N2 – 3<sup>rd</sup> item of dispute</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">111.        The 3<sup>rd</sup> item of dispute is

SS304 Pipe Sockets (for Ground Floor Unit only), see BAEIC 625 S/No B, item 7.</p>
<p xmlns="">112.        AL claimed seven sockets at the rate of

$140 per socket.</p>
<p xmlns="">113.        Wei Sin alleged only five sockets were

supplied and installed and the correct rate was $130 per unit.</p>
<p xmlns="">114.        AL did not pursue the quantity of seven

in cross-examination.</p>
<p xmlns="">115.        As for the rate, BAEIC 171 at Variation

Work Order Ref No 8 indicates the rate to be $140 per unit. BAEIC 171 is part of the

valuation by Wei Sin’s QS.</p>
<p xmlns="">116.        However, BAEIC 300 which is a document

from Wei Sin entitled ‘Breakdown of Variation Work’ shows the rate to be $130

per unit. The rate of $140 per unit used by the QS was probably an error.</p>
<p xmlns="">117.        Accordingly, I reject AL’s claim

for the difference both in terms of quantity and rate.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">N2 – 4<sup>th</sup> item of dispute</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">118.        The 4<sup>th</sup> item of dispute is

Long Galvanised Steel Railing.</p>
<p xmlns="">119.        AL’s sub-contract had originally

provided for the installation of this item which is identified at BAEIC 625 S/No A items

8, 11 and 12.</p>
<p xmlns="">120.        However as the items were subsequently

taken out from the sub-contract (and replaced by other items), AL did not claim payment

for the omitted items.</p>
<p xmlns="">121.        Notwithstanding this, Wei Sin proceeded

to deduct the dollar value of these items from AL’s claim.</p>
<p xmlns="">122.        I do not agree that Wei Sin is entitled

to make the deductions. The issue is not what the value of AL’s sub-contract is but

the value of AL’s works done. As AL had not claimed payment for these items in the

first place, Wei Sin was wrong to make deductions for them.</p>
<p xmlns="">123.        The deductions for these items total

$10,089 which should be added back to the monies payable to AL. This does not yet take

into account the 5% to be retained and the GST.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>

<p xmlns="">125.        AL claims $1,520 for this item.</p>
<p xmlns="">126.        Wei Sin says it was not done by AL.

However, this item is not reflected as an outstanding item which had to be done by another

sub-contractor of Wei Sin in BAEIC 630 and there was no suggestion that this item was

taken out from the main contract altogether. So it must have been done by AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">127.        Accordingly, I find for AL for this item

of $1,520 before taking into account the 5% to be retained and GST.</p>

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">N6 – 1<sup>st</sup> and only item of dispute</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">131.        The 1<sup>st</sup> and only item of

dispute for N6 is the Air-Condition Ledge Railings and Cloth Drying Racks

‘L-shaped’. This is the same item as the 2<sup>nd</sup> item of dispute in N2.</p>
<p xmlns="">132.        For N6, AL were claiming for the supply

and installation of 282 sets whereas Wei Sin said only 179.81 sets were supplied and

installed, see BAEIC 639 S/No A item 7.</p>
<p xmlns="">133.        It is true that Mr Quek did not

challenge DW3 Mr Poon on this item. However, in his report at BAEIC 103, PW2 Mr Teo had

already challenged the quantity alleged by Wei Sin by pointing out a discrepancy on Wei

Sin’s side. I will elaborate on the discrepancy later.</p>
<p xmlns="">134.        Secondly, the basis for Wei Sin’s

arriving at 179.81 sets for N6 was not explained by Mr Poon at trial. He gave an

explanation for this item only in the context of N2. Nor was any supporting document for

this figure found with his AEIC, although one is found in an earlier affidavit of one Tan

Beng Choo filed in Order 14 proceedings. Tan Beng Choo was not called as a witness.</p>
<p xmlns="">135.        Thirdly, if I were to apply Mr

Poon’s evidence for N2, I would conclude infer that Mr Poon also did not have

personal knowledge about how much was done or omitted for this item in N6.</p>
<p xmlns="">136.        Fourthly, there was a discrepancy on Wei

Sin’s side as pointed out by Mr Teo. The total number of sets under AL’s

sub-contract for N6 for this item was 334. If only 179.81 sets were supplied and installed

by AL, then the remaining quantity to be supplied and installed by another sub-contractor

would be 154.19 sets.</p>
<p xmlns="">137.        However, item 1 of BAEIC 641, which is

part of Mr Poon’s own report, shows that the remaining quantity was 51 sets and not

154.19 sets.</p>
<p xmlns="">138.        The 51 sets just about tallies with

AL’s claim of 282 sets as the two quantities added together make up 333 sets, just

one short of the 334 sets required under AL’s sub-contract before termination.</p>
<p xmlns="">139.        Mr Teo’s point about the

discrepancy was not challenged by Mr Shetty (see NE 124 line 20 to NE 125 line 8). Neither

did Mr Shetty challenge PW1 Mr Sim on the number of sets claimed by AL for this item.</p>
<p xmlns="">140.        Accordingly, I find for AL for this

item. The difference is 282 – 179.81 sets = 102.19 sets x $433.65 per set (which rate

is not disputed) = $44,314.69 before taking into account the 5% to be retained and GST.</p>
<p xmlns="">141.        The further sum to be paid to AL for

work done under N6 taking into account the 5% to be retained and adding GST would be:

the context of the rest of the terms.</p>
<p xmlns="">144.        As I have mentioned, each Letter of

<p xmlns="">145.        Clause 7 of the Standard Conditions

states:

</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">146.        Wei Sin’s case was that for each of

the sub-contracts, it was entitled to terminate and did terminate the sub-contract under

Clause 7(a), (b) and (c) of the Standard Conditions.</p>
<p xmlns="">147.        However, there was no discrete

allegation of breach under Clause 7(c) which was not already supposed to be covered by

Clause 7(a) or 7(b).</p>
<p xmlns="">148.        Wei Sin relied on various minutes and

correspondence and faxes in which AL was told of delay and defects in its works for each

sub-contract.</p>
<p xmlns="">149.        AL’s position was that it had not

been paid on its progress claims and because of this its works had progressed more slowly

and defects were not rectified.</p>
<p xmlns="">150.        AL also took the position that there was

no written schedule for its work and that the schedules were orally given. However, the

correspondence and faxes appeared to refer to written schedules and some also contained

written schedules. Eventually, AL’s Mr Sim had to concede that some of the schedules

were in writing although some were oral.</p>
<p xmlns="">151.        Although Mr Sim also suggested that the

manner in which Wei Sin co-ordinated the works was haphazard, nothing material turns on

this allegation as he did not elaborate with specifics.</p>
<p xmlns="">152.        I will deal with the sub-contracts

separately as they are two different contracts in law.</p>
<p xmlns="">153.        However, unless it is material, I will

not regurgitate the contents of all the minutes, correspondence and faxes which I was

referred to. For N2, I will refer to the dates of these documents with a brief

elaboration. For N6, I will summarise the documentary evidence since the material evidence

for N6 is the same documents as pertain to N2.</p>

    $450,291.19 and Jurong West N6 C28 for the price of $509,241.39 on the terms and

    conditions therein.</p>
<p align="justify">It was a term under both contracts that the term of payment shall be

    monthly, and that progress claims are to be submitted to you before the 25th of each

    month.</p>
<p align="justify">Pursuant to the contracts, our clients proceeded to supply, deliver and

    install the metal works for the project under both contracts and submitted their progress

    claims to you accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify">In breach of both contracts, you failed to pay the progress claims

    promptly and are in arrears of payment todate as follows:-</p>
<p align="justify">[<i>Various details about the progress claims are set out such as the

    dates and amounts thereof. However the fax assumes that the dates of the claims are also

    the due dates for payment which is not correct.]</i></p>
<p align="justify">You will no doubt appreciate that progress payments form the

    life-blood of any contractor and our clients are no exception. In view of your failure to

    pay the progress payments punctually or in full, and thereby in breach of the contract,

    our clients are unable to continue to supply and carry out the contractual works when

    payment is not forthcoming.</p>
<p align="justify">Despite promises on your part to pay our clients the arrears owing on

    the progress payments, you have not done so todate.</p>
<p align="justify">By reason of your breach of contract, you have left our clients with no

    alternative but to insist that the arrears owing on the progress payments under both

    contracts and totalling $397,063.62 are to be paid in full by 9th September 1999. On

    receipt of payment, our clients will then revert to you on such work schedule for the

    remaining works. However, if we as solicitors for our clients, do not receive full payment

    of the arrears by the stated deadline, then our clients will accept your breach of

    contract and terminate the contracts.</p>
<p align="justify">In such an event, our clients will claim against you the arrears of

    payment and such damages consequent on your breach.</p>

    appointment of your clients as the metal works sub-contractor for the above captioned

    projects, your clients fell into severe delay in respect of their scheduled installation

    works. Further, your clients were haphazard in the installation of their metal works

    resulting in numerous defects in the said installation. Despite repeated written and

    verbal notifications and reminders from our clients, your clients failed and/or refused to

    expedite their work so as to meet the schedule and rectify the defective works.</p>
<p align="justify">5.     In fact as early as 14<sup>th</sup> April

    1999, our clients had written to your clients in respect of a considerable number of

    defects in the sample unit (N6 C28 project). Enclosed in our clients’ letter to your

    defective works.</p>
<p align="justify">6.     Following this, our clients had written to

    your clients on numerous occasions concerning their slow and tardy work and the resultant

    defects in the same. On 12<sup>th</sup> August 1999, your clients submitted to our clients

    a revised works schedule which your clients had promised would be fulfilled. Despite their

    promise, the said works schedule was not fulfilled. On 18<sup>th</sup> August 1999, our

    clients’ Contracts Manager had again written to your clients setting out a detailed

</ol>
<p xmlns="">156.        Both sides accept that the sub-contracts

for N2 and N6 were terminated on 10 September 1999 but disagree as to who had validly

terminated the same.</p>
<p xmlns="">157.        As regards Wei Sin’s reliance on

Clause 7 of the Standard Conditions, I have to bear in mind that written notices about

delay and/or about poor workmanship are not uncommon. Accordingly, I am of the view that

it is not every written notice about the same that will constitute a written notice

pursuant to a provision for termination. If that were the case, life would be impossible

for the recipient of the written notice.</p>
<p xmlns="">158.        It is incumbent on a party who wishes to

exercise its right to terminate a contract or sub-contract to make it clear that the

written notice is being given pursuant to the provision for termination.</p>
<p xmlns="">159.        Ideally, the written notice should

identify the provision that it is issued pursuant to, although I do not say that this is

always necessary (see <i>Supamarl Ltd v Federated Homes Ltd</i> [1981] 9 Con LR 25).

However the recipient must be left in no doubt that the notice was sent pursuant to a

particular provision since complaints or chasers in the construction industry are not

uncommon.</p>
<p xmlns="">160.        AL have admitted to some delay but have

not conceded that they would have been unable to catch up with the delay.</p>
<p xmlns="">161.        As for defects, Wei Sin has a few photos

of defective works for N2 but they are by no means comprehensive. AL have admitted to the

existence of defects but said they were minor.</p>
<p xmlns="">162.        Prior to 2 August 1999 there were

various faxes or letters from Wei Sin primarily about delay, although concern was also

expressed about the adequacy of expansion bolts and workmanship. However, none of the

documents from Wei Sin referred to Clause 7. Neither was there any intimation therein that

any was sent pursuant to Clause 7 or any other provision.</p>
<p xmlns="">163.        It was only in the letter dated 2 August

1999 that a reference is made to one of the terms in the Standard Conditions (see para

155(m) above). Even then, the reference was to Clause 13 and not Clause 7. Secondly the

reference to Clause 13 then was in the context of the aluminium sunbreakers only.</p>
<p xmlns="">164.        Clause 13 states: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘13. FAILURE TO PERFORM</p>
<p align="justify">If the Sub-Contractor should fail to carry out any part of the work

    under this contract, the Main Contractor reserve the right to engage others or carry out

    the work himself and recover from the Sub-Contractor all additional cost and any loss

    suffered as a result.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">165.        In the next notice i.e the fax dated 16

August 1999 from Wei Sin, the primary concern was about delay, although unacceptable

workmanship was also mentioned (see para 155(o) above). </p>
<p xmlns="">166.        However, the concern about delay was

focussed on the sunbreakers and sun louvres. The threat to resort to other alternatives

was, in my view, also in the context of the delay in respect of these items.</p>
<p xmlns="">167.        I find that the 16 August 1999 notice

was also sent pursuant to Clause 13 coming as it did after the notice dated 2 August 1999

and in view of the substance of the 2 and 16 August 1999 notices. The threat was not to

terminate the sub-contract but to engage other sub-contractors for certain specific areas

of work supposed to be done by AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">168.        In the fax dated 18 August 1999, Wei Sin

informed AL that it was engaging others to complete outstanding MS and galvanised steel

work. Sunbreakers and sun louvres would be taken out from AL’s sub-contract. AL was

to carry on with stainless steel work and given a week’s grace period to complete all

outstanding stainless steel work (see para 155(q) above).</p>
<p xmlns="">169.        This fax also does not refer to any

particular provision of the Standard Conditions. Again, I find that Wei Sin was in fact

acting pursuant to Clause 13 and not Clause 7.</p>
<p xmlns="">170.        Finally, I revert to HEP’s fax

dated 10 September 1999 which was sent pursuant to Clause 7(a), (b) and (c) of the

Standard Conditions.</p>
<p xmlns="">171.        There are various errors in that fax.</p>
<p xmlns="">172.        For example, it is not true that

AL’s work is subject to approval of HDB so that absence of such approval would

disentitle AL to payment. Clause 12 of the Standard Conditions refers not to approval for

the purpose of paying progress claims but that final acceptance of AL’s works would

be subject to approval by HDB and all relevant authorities. Secondly, Clause 7 does not

require a remedial plan from AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">173.    In any event, under Clause 7, AL was to be given three days to

comply with a prior written notice before Wei Sin can terminate the sub-contract.</p>
<p xmlns="">174.        In response to my question as to whether

the prior notice under Clause 7 had been given, Mr Shetty referred to the one week grace

period given in Wei Sin’s fax dated 18 August 1999. He submitted that this was more

than the three days prior written notice required under Clause 7.</p>
<p xmlns="">175.        I have the following observations about

this response. </p>
<p xmlns="">176.        First, Wei Sin’s Defence and

Counterclaim does not identify the 18 August 1999 telefax as the prior notice under Clause

7.</p>
<p xmlns="">177.        Secondly, as I have mentioned, that fax

did not refer specifically to Clause 7. Mr Shetty had assumed it was sent pursuant to

Clause 7. He had not taken into account that it might have been sent pursuant to Clause 13

instead. Neither did he take into account the earlier notice dated 2 August 1999 from Wei

Sin which specifically refers to Clause 13 and not Clause 7.</p>
<p xmlns="">178.        Thirdly the fax dated 18 August 1999 had

purported to tell AL that other sub-contractors had been engaged for mild steel and

galvanised steel work. The one week grace period was given only in relation to stainless

steel work and not in relation to the entire sub-contract for N2.</p>
<p xmlns="">179.        Fourthly, none of the witnesses for Wei

Sin had alleged that the intention was to send the 18 August 1999 fax pursuant to Clause

7. For example, DW1 Ms Rogelita said that she had drafted most of Wei Sin’s

correspondence for N2 but she did not say that the 18 August 1999 fax was sent pursuant to

Clause 7.</p>
<p xmlns="">180.        I find that the fax dated 18 August 1999

was not the prior three day notice required under Clause 7.</p>
<p xmlns="">181.        The truth is that Wei Sin had never

intended to terminate the sub-contract prior to HEP’s fax dated 10 September 1999.

This is reinforced by its faxes subsequent to 18 August 1999 which I have referred to

above.</p>
<p xmlns="">182.        However after Wei Sin was faced with the

demand fax dated 4 September 1999 from B T Tan &amp; Co, it decided on a pre-emptive

strike. That is why the fax dated 10 September 1999 from HEP was sent before B T Tan &amp;

Co acted to terminate the sub-contract.</p>
<p xmlns="">183.        Had HEP given the three day prior

written notice instead, B T Tan &amp; Co would have terminated the sub-contract before the

expiry of the three day notice.</p>
<p xmlns="">184.        I find that the purported termination

notice by HEP pursuant to Clause 7 was not a valid one.</p>
<p xmlns="">185.        As Wei Sin have not pleaded or submitted

that AL’s conduct or the fax demand dated 4 September 1999 from B T Tan &amp; Co

constituted a repudiatory breach by AL in any event, I need not consider this point any

further.</p>
<p xmlns="">186.        I come back to the fax dated 10

September 1999 from B T Tan &amp; Co (see para 155(y) above).</p>
<p xmlns="">187.        It refers to HEP’s letter dated 7

September 1999. There is no such letter before me, only the one from HEP dated 10

September 1999. There is, however, a 7 September 1999 fax from Wei Sin (see para 155(w)

above). The reference to 7 September 1999 was probably an inadvertent error.</p>
<p xmlns="">188.        However, I also note that B T Tan &amp;

Co’s fax dated 10 September 1999 does not specify whether Wei Sin’s breach of

contract is only as regards the failure to pay the progress claims or it includes the

invalid notice from HEP dated 10 September 1999. The Statement of Claim seems to refer to

both as repudiatory breaches by Wei Sin but again this is not clear.</p>
<p xmlns="">189.        As for the closing submissions, para 120

of Mr Quek’s Closing Submission submits that the HEP notice was an anticipatory

breach and Mr Shetty’s Closing Submission at para 2(ii) and 8(2) assumes that AL have

raised the argument that the HEP notice was a repudiatory breach.</p>
<p xmlns="">190.        Accordingly, I will deal with both

points, i.e whether Wei Sin’s failure to pay and whether HEP’s notice each

constituted repudiatory breaches.</p>
<p xmlns="">191.        As regards the question whether delay in

payment would constitute a repudiatory breach, I need refer to the following authorities

only. </p>
<p xmlns="">192.        Hudson’s Building and Engineering

Contracts 1995 Eleventh Edition states at p 622 to 623: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘<b>(e) Payment obligations and set-off</b></p>
<p align="justify">Mere breach of a payment obligation does not constitute a common

    law repudiation. The principle is to consider whether the circumstances of the non-payment

    show an intention not to be bound: "The principle to be applied in these cases is

    whether the non-delivery or the non-payment amounts to an abandonment of the contract or a

    refusal to perform it on the part of the person making the default". Thus in <i>Mersey

    Steel &amp; Iron v. Naylor</i> where a supplier of steel to be delivered by instalments

    was not entitled to refuse to deliver a late delivery on the ground of non-payment of the

    instalment for an earlier delivery, Lord Blackburn said:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"There was a statement that for reasons which they thought

      sufficient, they were not willing to pay for the iron at present, and if that statement

      had been an absolute refusal to pay … I will not say it might not have been evidence

      to go to the jury, for them to say whether it would not amount to a refusal to go on with

      the contract, for a man might reasonably so consider it. But there is nothing of that kind

      here."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">So a clear indication of refusal or inability to pay future instalments

    will be a repudiation, as also a repeated failure to pay on time in response to warnings,

    if raising the inference of an intention to pay late habitually so as to derive financial

    advantage, it is submitted. Generally, delay in making payments, if sufficiently serious

    and persisted in after warnings, may, after a suitable notice, justify rescission, the

    more so in the absence of provisions for interest on late payment in the contract.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">193.        Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore Volume

2 p 374 to 375 states: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘<b>[30.290] Repudiation in general</b></p>
<p align="justify">The defaulting party repudiates the contract when he intimates by

    words or conduct that he does not intend to honour his obligations under the contract when

    they fall due. A repudiation can be made explicitly or implicitly. A breach of contract

    can also be anticipatory and the innocent party would be entitled to treat it as

    repudiated if the threatened non-performance has the effect of depriving him ‘of

    substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties that he should

    obtain from the primary obligations of the parties under the contract’. There can be

    repudiation where one party insists on carrying out his obligations in his own way that is

    substantially inconsistent with his obligations under the contract. Not every refusal to

    proceed with the contract can be regarded as a repudiation. If the decision is taken bona

    fide based on an erroneous interpretation of the contract, put in a way that is open to

    correction, it may not necessarily be regarded as repudiation.</p>
<b><p align="justify">[30.291] Repudiation by employer</p>
</b><p align="justify">Instances of repudiatory breaches include the employer’s

    failure to give possession of the site to the contractor or where the contractor is

    wrongfully ejected from the site and where the architect or contract administrator refuses

    to certify payment at the appropriate time or constantly under-certifies the amount due

    arising from undue interference by the employer. A mere failure or delay by the employer

    in making payment per se would not amount to a repudiation. However, the position would be

    different if it can be demonstrated that the employer was ‘not merely stalling for

    time to make payment’ to the contractor but that he did not intend to pay the

    contractor ‘at all and perform the contract’. It is possible that a general and

    consistent refusal to pay instalments for goods on the due dates or make interim payments

    may be considered either as a demonstration of such a intention or by itself suffice to

    constitute repudiatory conduct. ….’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">194.        Law and Practice of Construction

Contract Claim by Chow Kok Fong, Second Edition, states at p 264: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘A party to a building contract may find it necessary to bring his

    involvement in the contract to an end where the other party has committed a breach of

    contract and this breach is so serious as to undermine the fundamental commercial

    objectives of the innocent party under the contract. In deciding to resort to this

    recourse, the innocent party will take into account both the magnitude and nature of the

    breach. Thus a single instance of late payment may not be sufficient to warrant

    termination, but a persistent course of payment delays or a protracted delay in the

    payment of a very substantial amount may lead a contractor to contemplate termination as a

    means of mitigating his loss.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">At p 277:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘It is suggested that it would not be sufficient if the

    non-payment arises only from the employer’s belief that the amount due to the

    contractor should be set off against the contractor’s liability for liquidated

    damages or defective work. On the other hand, clearly, non-payment becomes a serious

    breach if it intimates an intention by the employer not to be bound by the payment terms

    of the contract regardless of how well the contractor fulfilled his obligations under the

    contract.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">195.        In <i>Brani Readymixed Pte Ltd v Yee

Hong Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 205</nobr>, the Court of Appeal recognised that the mere failure or

delay in making payment per se would not amount to a repudiation. However, on the facts in

that case, the Court of Appeal found that there was repudiation.</p>
<p xmlns="">196.        I have already set out above in detail

the extent of the arbitrary conduct of Wei Sin regarding the progress claims by AL for N2

resulting not only in delay in payment but also in under-paying AL even when payment was

paid. Indeed, initially, AL did not know that Wei Sin had been paying less than what its

own QS had recommended as there was no indication from Wei Sin that it was withholding

sums, beyond the 5% retention, for delay or defects. This culminated in Wei Sin

withholding the entire $90,000 for Progress Claim No 3 even after it was (a) recommended

for payment by the QS, (b) due for payment and (c) after Wei Sin had agreed to pay the

same.</p>
<p xmlns="">197.        The entire $90,000 was withheld without

any attempt by Wei Sin to assess at the material time the impact of AL’s delay on the

main contract works or the cost of rectifying defects.</p>
<p xmlns="">198.        I find that while Wei Sin wanted AL to

carry out its obligations, it was content to exercise its obligations in its own way

substantially inconsistent with such obligations. Wei Sin had acted in an arbitrary and,

indeed, oppressive manner and was quite content not to abide by such obligations as and

when they fell due if this suited its purpose.</p>
<p xmlns="">199.        I find that Wei Sin’s conduct prior

to HEP’s notice dated 10 September 1999 was repudiatory in nature.</p>
<p xmlns="">200.        As regards the question whether an

invalid notice of termination may constitute repudiation, Halsbury’s Laws of

Singapore Vol 2 states at p 381: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘<b>[30.300] Procedural requirements</b></p>
<p align="justify">Most standard form contracts specify a procedure for the party

    seeking termination to carry out. To avoid any sudden and unexpected termination or any

    uncertainty as to whether a termination has taken place, most of these procedures laid out

    require the party seeking termination to go through at least two stages where certain

    specific actions must be taken or notices given. The SIA form (5th Ed), for instance,

    provides for the issuance of a termination certificate by the architect and a notice of

    termination by the employer. Similarly the PSSCC95 provides for the issuance of a

    termination certificate by the superintending officer. On the issuance of such a

    certificate and the occurrence of certain specified events, the employer ‘may give to

    the contractor notice in writing of the termination of the employment of the

    contractor’. An employer’s purported termination that did not comply with the

    procedural requirements or which is found to be invalid for other reasons may amount to a

    repudiation of the contract that the contractor is entitled to accept. …</p>

    are not made out, where the party alleged to be in breach has in fact been released from

    its obligations, where termination was made on the basis of a purported fundamental breach

<p xmlns="">201.        I am of the view that Wei Sin did not

genuinely believe that it was entitled to terminate the sub-contract for N2. It was trying

to prevent AL from exercising its right to terminate first. I find that the invalid notice

by HEP also constituted a repudiatory breach by Wei Sin.</p>
<p xmlns="">202.        Each of these repudiatory breaches has

been accepted by B T Tan &amp; Co and the sub-contract for N2 has been terminated by AL.</p>

</i>
<p xmlns="">203.        On another point, Mr Quek had submitted

in para 18 of his Closing Submission that one of the main issues was whether any act of

prevention by Wei Sin had resulted in the delay of the work by AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">204.        However, this allegation was not

pleaded.</p>
<p xmlns="">205.        Secondly, the evidence of PW1 Mr Sim on

this point was general and vague. It seems to me that the failure by Wei Sin to pay on

time and to make full payment had caused a cash-flow problem for AL but not something more

desperate. Certainly there was no concrete evidence about financial impossibility.</p>
<p xmlns="">206.        Thirdly, while Mr Quek mentioned the

argument as to whether there was any act of prevention by Wei Sin in his Closing

Submission, Mr Quek did not develop this argument.</p>
<p xmlns="">207.        Therefore, it is not necessary for me to

deal with this argument any further save that I should mention a point of law that Mr

Shetty had raised in connection with it.</p>
<p xmlns="">208.        Mr Shetty sought to persuade me that

even if Wei Sin had defaulted in its payment obligations, this did not entitle AL to

suspend its work or to go slow. He cited the following passage from the judgment of

Woodhouse and Cooke JJ, delivered by Cooke J, in the New Zealand case of <i>Canterbury

Pipe Lines Ltd v The Christchurch Drainage Board</i> <nobr>[1979] 16 BLR 76</nobr> at p 95: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘… we are against recognising such a right [to stop work by

    reason of substantial default by the employer in paying a certified progress payment] when

    the architect or engineer has declined to issue the certificate stipulated for by the

    contract as the condition precedent to the employer’s duty to pay. It would disrupt

    the scheme of the contracts. It could encourage contractors to take the law into their own

    hands…. In such cases, if the contractor cannot prove impossibility or its

    equivalent, he will be left with whatever remedies regarding the recovery of progress

    payments may be available to him under the contract.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">209.        I have read the judgment delivered by

Cooke J. It is not authority for the wide proposition that Mr Shetty was advocating and

the passage that he had cited was taken out of context by him.</p>
<p xmlns="">210.        The judgment makes it clear that it is

confined to the situation where a consultant has declined to issue a certificate as a

condition precedent to the obligation to pay and left the issue open as regards other

situations where, as in the case before me, the obligation to pay is not dependent on such

a certificate.</p>
<p xmlns="">211.        Indeed, the judgment of McMullin J in

the same case seems to favour a right on the part of a contractor not to proceed with work

if the party obliged to pay withholds and continues to withhold payment, and thereby makes

it financially impossible for the contractor to carry on.</p>
<p xmlns="">212.        At p 119, McMullin J said: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘Although I have been unable to find any case where the wrongful

    withholding of a progress payment has been held to be a breach of the rule that a party to

    a contract shall not profit by his own wrong and, to that extent the judgment may appear

    to be breaking new ground, there would seem to be no difference in principle between an

    employer who keeps a contractor out of his land (<i>Holme v Guppy</i>), or fails to supply

    the requisite plans (<i>Roberts v Bury Commissioners</i>), or unjustifiably interferes in

    the course of building (<i>Russell v Bandeira</i>), and an employer who keeps his

    contractor out of payment for work already done, declares his intention to keep him out of

    payments in the future, denies him arbitration on these very matters and requires him to

    continue with the work. The differences go only to the means by which the wrongs were

    done, not to their effect. The Board’s acts were such as to prevent and make

    impossible the performance of the contract as effectively as if it had denied appellant

    access to the works. …’ </p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">213.        Mr Shetty also relied on a passage in

the judgment of Judge Hawser QC in the case of <i>Supamarl Ltd v Federated Homes Ltd</i>

[1981] 9 Con LR 25 at p 28: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘Even if Federated were in breach of contract in failure to pay, I

    do not think that this would exercise or justify failure by Supamarl to proceed with their

    work in a proper manner.’</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">214.        However, Judge Hawser did not cite any

authority for the proposition he had mentioned.</p>
<p xmlns="">215.        Therefore, I will say only that the

question whether a contractor or sub-contractor may suspend work or go slow if there is

default in payment to it and this has rendered its performance financially impossible is

not a simple one. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Other arguments by Mr Shetty</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">216.        Mr Shetty had various other arguments.</p>
<p xmlns="">217.        He submitted that AL was incapable of

fulfilling its obligations for two reasons: (a) financial incapability and (b) lack of

materials.</p>
<p xmlns="">218.        As regards the first reason, there is

insufficient evidence to establish that AL was financially incapable of carrying out its

obligations even if Wei Sin had not withheld payment.</p>
<p xmlns="">219.        As for the second reason, PW1 Mr Sim has

explained and I accept that there was a shortage of material on AL’s part because Wei

Sin withheld payment from AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">220.        In any event, these two reasons do not

advance Wei Sin’s case much as I have found HEP’s termination notice to be

invalid. </p>
<p xmlns="">221.        Mr Shetty also suggested that AL was

trying to put pressure on Wei Sin by going slow as AL knew that Wei Sin would be liable

for liquidated damages to HDB. He relied on a sentence in the evidence of PW1 Mr Sim at NE

65 line 5 to 12: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘Q Instead of Plaintiffs’ increasing manpower on site for N6

    and improving progress, Plaintiffs’ lawyers sent a letter of demand 4 days later?</p>
<p align="justify">A Yes. But for more than one month there was all talk of payment.

    Defendants also asked us to do additional work. We bought material. <u>We felt that if

    they keep delaying it will ultimately affect the Defendants having to pay LD to HDB</u>.

    If Defendants keep delaying and we continue doing the work, for new work there would be a

    problem, no money coming in for us to buy material and pay workers. For touch up, no

    problem.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">222.        I do not think that the isolated

sentence which Mr Shetty was relying on shows that AL was trying to put pressure on Wei

Sin by going slow. AL was aware that if Wei Sin is faced with a claim for liquidated

damages due to AL’s delay, Wei Sin would in turn claim the same liquidated damages

against AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">223.        The totality of Mr Sim’s evidence

during the trial was that AL was concerned that if they did the work, Wei Sin would still

withhold payment.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Summary on termination of N2 sub-contract </p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">224.        In summary, the termination of the

sub-contract for N2 by HEP on behalf of Wei Sin is not valid. On the other hand, B T Tan

&amp; Co have validly terminated the sub-contract on behalf of AL.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Main claims by Wei Sin for N2</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">225.        Accordingly, Wei Sin is not entitled to

claim damages for engaging other sub-contractors to complete the outstanding work of AL in

respect of N2. However, Mr Quek has conceded in para 95 of his Closing Submission that Wei

Sin may claim damages for engaging other sub-contractors to rectify AL’s defective

work, subject of course to Wei Sin proving the nature and extent of defective work and the

quantum of rectification.</p>
<p xmlns="">226.        As for damages for delay, Wei Sin did

not claim it is entitled to this even if its termination for N2 is invalid. As its

termination is not valid, it is not entitled to claim damages for delay. However, for

completeness, I will deal with this claim on the assumption that Wei Sin’s

termination is valid.</p>
<p xmlns="">227.        Under Clause 8 of the Standard

Conditions, AL is to pay liquidated damages payable for delay to Wei Sin at rates which

are pegged to the rates payable by Wei Sin to HDB. For N2, Wei Sin is claiming $1,412,670

as liquidated damages against AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">228.        However, I had ascertained from DW2 Mr

Soh that HDB was not making any claim for liquidated damages against Wei Sin for N2 as

sufficient extension of time had been granted by HDB to Wei Sin.</p>
<p xmlns="">229.        Subsequently, I asked Mr Shetty why Wei

Sin was claiming liquidated damages for N2.</p>
<p xmlns="">230.        He said that he was of the view that Wei

Sin was entitled to claim the theoretical maximum. He suggested that Wei Sin had claimed

damages to be assessed and not liquidated damages as such. He also said that Wei Sin had

given up something to HDB in exchange for HDB not claiming liquidated damages for N2.</p>
<p xmlns="">231.        I am of the view that this is an

unsatisfactory explanation. AL is liable to pay liquidated damages to Wei Sin only if Wei

Sin is liable for liquidated damages to HDB for delay caused by AL. That is why the rates

of liquidated damages which may be payable by AL are identical to that which may be

payable by Wei Sin to HDB. As HDB is not claiming any liquidated damages against Wei Sin

for N2, Wei Sin cannot claim any liquidated damages against AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">232.        Although the Defence and Counterclaim

had claimed damages generally, the Voluntary Particulars thereof had mentioned

specifically liquidated damages and the sum claimed under this head. </p>
<p xmlns="">233.        I am of the view that Wei Sin’s

claim for about $1.4m liquidated damages was a fraudulent claim. Wei Sin had included this

claim for two reasons.</p>
<p xmlns="">234.        First, if this claim had not been made,

the quantum of the rest of Wei Sin’s counterclaim would have been less than the

balance amount which Wei Sin had conceded was to be paid to AL. The claim for liquidated

damages was therefore to justify Wei Sin’s withholding any further payment to AL in

the meantime.</p>
<p xmlns="">235.        Secondly, the huge sum claimed for

liquidated damages was to put undue pressure on AL.</p>
<p xmlns="">236.        If indeed Wei Sin had to give up

something to HDB in exchange for an extension of time to avoid liquidated damages, that is

a different matter altogether which must be pleaded but was not. Neither was there any

evidence alluding to it.</p>
<p xmlns="">237.        Accordingly, even if Wei Sin’s

termination of the sub-contract for N2 is valid, Wei Sin is not entitled to claim any

damages, whether liquidated or not, for alleged delay by AL in respect of N2. It is not a

question of leaving this head of claim to be assessed.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Termination of N6 sub-contract</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">238.        As in N2, there were faxes or letters

from Wei Sin to AL in respect of N6 complaining about delay and poor workmanship.</p>
<p xmlns="">239.        There were also minutes of meetings

raising these points but it was not suggested that these constitute written notification

under Clause 7 of the Standard Conditions.</p>
<p xmlns="">240.        I do not intend to list out the faxes or

letters as I did for N2.</p>
<p xmlns="">241.        Suffice it for me to say that, as in N2,

none of the faxes or letters from Wei Sin prior to 2 August 1999 referred to Clause 7 of

the Standard Conditions. Neither was there any intimation in any of them that it was sent

pursuant to Clause 7 or any other provision.</p>
<p xmlns="">242.        As in N2, there was a similar letter

from Wei Sin for N6 dated 2 August 1999 (but this is at BAEIC 511) referring to Clause 13.

Furthermore, the contents of Wei Sin’s fax dated 16 August 1999 and 18 August 1999

and HEP’s fax dated 10 September 1999, which I have referred to above, apply both to

N2 and to N6.</p>
<p xmlns="">243.        Accordingly, the views I have expressed

on the letter dated 2 August 1999, and the faxes dated 16 August, 18 August and 10

September 1999 also apply in the context of N6.</p>
<p xmlns="">244.        The correspondence and faxes between Wei

Sin and AL for N6 between 2 August 1999 and 10 September 1999 which I have not

specifically identified in my judgment but which I have read, do not alter the views I

have expressed on the material letter and faxes identified above.</p>
<p xmlns="">245.        Accordingly, I find that the purported

termination notice by HEP pursuant to Clause 7 in the context of N6 was also not valid.</p>
<p xmlns="">246.        Again, Wei Sin has not pleaded or

alleged AL’s conduct or the fax demand dated 4 September 1999 from B T Tan &amp; Co

as constituting a repudiatory breach of the sub-contract for N6 and I need not consider

this point any further.</p>
<p xmlns="">247.        My views in paras 186 to 195 on the fax

dated 10 September 1999 from B T Tan &amp; Co and the law on delay in payment as a

repudiatory breach also apply to N6.</p>
<p xmlns="">248.        However the question is still whether

the conduct of Wei Sin regarding the progress claims for N6 was also repudiatory in

nature.</p>
<p xmlns="">249.        On this point, I note that both AL and

its solicitors often treated the sub-contracts for N2 and N6 as one, although they are

separate contracts. A repudiatory breach by Wei Sin of the sub-contract for N2 does not

necessarily mean that Wei Sin had also been guilty of a similar breach for N6.</p>
<p xmlns="">250.        As at 16 August 1999 (i.e when Wei Sin

had sent its fax to say that other sub-contractors had been engaged for some of the work

and to give one week for the stainless steel work to be completed), the difference between

AL’s Progress Claim Nos 1 to 3 and Wei Sin’s payment was only $8,400.</p>
<p xmlns="">251.        PW1 Mr Sim accepted that this did not

evince an intention by Wei Sin not to make further payments to AL (NE 34 line 21 to 23).</p>
<p xmlns="">252.        I also recall that payment for Progress

Claim No 2 for N6 was made ‘early’ although this was because of the reason I

have mentioned in para 55 above.</p>
<p xmlns="">253.        However, the position as at 4 September

1999, i.e the date of the fax demand from B T Tan &amp; Co, was quite different. By then,

the difference between the amount claimed by AL and due for payment on the one hand and

the amount paid by Wei Sin on the other hand had increased to $30,495.79 (see the

tabulation in para 54 above). This was because no payment was made for Progress Claim No 4

which was due for payment on 25 August 1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">254.        The reason given for non-payment was one

of the same general reasons given for N2 i.e concern that AL’s ‘work was very

slow and may delay completion of project’ (see NE 149 line 19).</p>
<p xmlns="">255.        However, again, Wei Sin did not adduce

any evidence as to how much AL’s works in N6 had delayed the main contract works to

justify withholding every cent from Progress Claim No 4.</p>
<p xmlns="">256.        I am of the view that the although the

amount that has been withheld and the frequency of delay or withholding of payment are

relevant, I should also take into account the motive or reason behind Wei Sin’s

conduct in withholding payment.</p>
<p xmlns="">257.        I find that as in N2, Wei Sin was

content to exercise its obligations for N6 in its own way substantially inconsistent with

such obligations. Wei Sin was content not to abide by such obligations as and when they

fell due if this suited its purpose. Wei Sin was in repudiatory breach.</p>
<p xmlns="">258.        As regards the question whether

HEP’s invalid notice was also a repudiatory breach, my views in para 200 to 201 above

also apply to N6. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Summary on termination of N6 sub-contract</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">259.        In the circumstances, I find that Wei

Sin was also in repudiatory breach of contract for N6 in withholding payment of Progress

Claim No 4 and also in respect of HEP’s invalid notice. The repudiation has been

accepted. </p>
<p xmlns="">260.        My views in paras 203 to 223 above on a

contractor’s right to suspend work or go slow and on Mr Shetty’s other arguments

also apply for N6.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Main claims by Wei Sin for N6</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">261.        Accordingly, Wei Sin is not entitled to

be paid the additional costs in engaging other sub-contractors to complete outstanding

work of AL for N6 but is entitled, in the light of Mr Quek’s concession in para 95 of

his Closing Submission, to claim damages for engaging other sub-contractors to rectify

defects in AL’s work, subject to proof of the same.</p>
<p xmlns="">262.        As for damages for delay, Wei Sin did

not claim it is entitled to this if its termination for N6 is invalid. As its termination

is not valid, it is not entitled to claim damages for delay. However, for completeness, I

will deal with this claim on the assumption that Wei Sin’s termination is valid.</p>
<p xmlns="">263.        As in N2, Clause 8 of the Standard

Conditions for N6 allows Wei Sin to claim liquidated damages for delay at rates which are

pegged to the rates payable by Wei Sin to HDB.</p>
<p xmlns="">264.        Wei Sin is claiming $2,158,650 as

liquidated damages against AL for N6. </p>
<p xmlns="">265.        However, DW2 Mr Soh said that for N6,

HDB had claimed about $400,000 as liquidated damages against Wei Sin. Mr Soh also admitted

that Wei Sin did not take into account the liquidated damages sought by HDB when Wei Sin

claimed liquidated damages against AL (NE 168 line 21 to 23). </p>
<p xmlns="">266.        In my view, the quantum of Wei

Sin’s claim of about $2.15m as liquidated damages was therefore yet another

fraudulent claim by Wei Sin to put undue pressure on AL, although Wei Sin might have been

able to claim a lesser sum, subject to proof, if it had validly terminated the N6

sub-contract.</p>
<p xmlns="">267.        As regards any suggestion that Wei Sin

might have given up something to reduce the liquidated damages claimed by HDB in N6 and

that AL should bear what Wei Sin had to give up, this must be pleaded but was not. There

was also no evidence on it. Accordingly, AL is also not liable for such damages.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">AL’S CLAIMS FOR LOSS OF PROFIT (N2 AND N6)</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">268.        As regards AL’s claims for loss of

profit for N2 and for N6, I note that in <i>Canterbury</i>, the New Zealand Court of

Appeal decided that the contractor should not be entitled to loss of profits because it

had wrongly withheld its work even though the notice of termination from the developer was

invalid.</p>
<p xmlns="">269.        Although no authority was cited for this

approach and the decision may have been because the contractor had not terminated the

contract, AL also has not established that it was entitled to go slow.</p>
<p xmlns="">270.        I am of the view that where it is

fortuitous as to who first terminates the sub-contracts, a claim for loss of profit should

not be allowed.</p>
<p xmlns="">271.        Accordingly, I will disallow AL’s

claims for loss of profit for each of the sub-contracts.</p>

<p xmlns="">275.        Wei Sin also claimed $10,000 and $2,000

them against AL. If Wei Sin is prepared not to challenge the imposition of such fines for

commercial reasons, then Wei Sin must bear such fines.</p>
<p xmlns="">276.        There was no evidence before me that HDB

is contractually entitled to impose such fines. Therefore I disallow Wei Sin’s claim

against AL for such fines.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Wei Sin’s claims for re-test on anchor bolts (N2 and N6)</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">277.        I will, however, allow Wei Sin’s

claim for cost of re-test on anchor bolts for N2 and N6 in principle since AL has accepted

that it is partially responsible for the failure of such bolts. This is subject to proof

as to how much AL was to blame for the failure and the quantum of such loss.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Wei Sin’s claim for mobilisation (N2)</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">278.        Wei Sin’s claim for $60 for

mobilisation of personnel and equipment on site for N2 is disallowed. It is a general

claim and there is inadequate evidence to establish that it was incurred because of AL.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Wei Sin’s claim for administrative charge (N6)</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">279.        Wei Sin’s claim for $2,000 as

administrative charge imposed by HDB for non-compliance of Sunbreaker dimension in N6 is

also disallowed. There was no evidence before me that HDB was contractually entitled to

impose such a charge. </p>

<p align="justify">OVERALL SUMMARY</p>
