<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff’s claim arises out of a
                    transaction in which she purchased several works of art from the first
                    defendant. The action is based on misrepresentation as well as on a breach of an
                    undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff has a doctorate in law and runs a
                    number of specialist clinics. She is married to Mr Felix Huang
                    (“Mr Huang”). The first defendant is a well known businessman
                    in Singapore and has collected art works for many years. The second defendant
                    was his personal assistant at all material times.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The purchase of the paintings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Sometime in September 2008, Mr Huang was
                    introduced to one Mr Marcus Chin (“Mr Chin”) by a mutual
                    friend. When Mr Chin found out that Mr Huang was interested in art, he
                    suggested that Mr Huang meet the first defendant, as the latter was an avid
                    art collector with a vast collection of art in his office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 17 September 2008, Mr Chin arranged a
                    meeting between himself, Mr Huang and the first defendant at the first
                    defendant’s office at HUB Synergy Point. When Mr Huang arrived at the
                    office, he was greeted by the second defendant, whom Mr Chin introduced as
                    his mother. Shortly thereafter, the first defendant joined the
                meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Huang claimed in his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) that the first defendant had said that
                    he was a successful businessman who had been collecting paintings for many
                    years, and showed him photographs of himself with dignitaries. The first
                    defendant also told Mr Huang that he had purchased most of his paintings
                    directly from the artists. He told Mr Huang to choose a few paintings and
                    promised to give him a very good discount for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mr Huang then picked out seven paintings
                    and one wood carving. These were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     a painting signed with the name
                        “Walter Spies”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     a painting with the purported signature of Wang Yi
                        Dong;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     two
                        paintings with the initials AF, purportedly the signature of the painter
                        Affandi;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     a
                        painting with the purported signature of Hendra Gunawan;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     a painting in which the painter’s
                        name could not be made out;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_f"></a>(f)     a painting signed with the name signed <em>“</em>R Bonnet; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_g"></a>(g)     a wood carving engraved with the name “Hendra
                        Gunawan”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first defendant said that he was prepared to
                    accept $150,000 for these works. According to Mr Huang, the first defendant
                    assured him that if he was not wholly satisfied with the purchase or if he
                    discovered that any of the art pieces were not originals, the $150,000 would be
                    refunded to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On the same day, Mr Huang informed the
                    plaintiff of this meeting and the selection he had made. The plaintiff was keen
                    to view the first defendant’s collection of artworks. So, later that
                    evening, the plaintiff and Mr Huang met the first defendant at his office
                    (“the 17 September 2008 evening meeting”). The plaintiff claimed
                        that<sup></sup>she enquired whether or not the art pieces were originals and the
                    first defendant replied that they were originals. The first defendant added that
                    he would never collect counterfeits, and reiterated that if the art works were
                    counterfeits, he would give her a full refund.<sup></sup>The plaintiff then paid $150,000 for<sup></sup>the pieces which her husband had selected (“the first
                    agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff and Mr Huang were keen to
                    increase their collection further. On 21 September 2008, Mr Huang met the
                    second defendant at premises at Ang Siang Hill. The second defendant took
                    Mr Huang to a storeroom where there were numerous paintings. She drew
                    Mr Huang’s attention to a set of ten paintings which were purportedly
                    by the artist Affandi. Mr Huang chose two of these paintings. Thereafter,
                    the second defendant told him that if he was interested in the rest of the
                    shipment, he should proceed to the first defendant’s office. Mr Huang
                    did so and there, in the presence of the first defendant, he chose the following
                    ten paintings and sketches:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     two charcoal sketches by artists
                        whose names could not be made out;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     a painting bearing the name “Walter
                        Spies”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     a
                        painting which Mr Huang claims that the second defendant orally
                        represented as an original signed by Xu Bei Hong;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     a painting which the first defendant
                        allegedly orally represented as being painted by Wai Meng, whom he described
                        as a famous painter;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_e"></a>(e)     a painting bearing the name “Antonio Blanco” with a
                        certificate at the back of the painting describing it as an authentic
                        Antonio Blanco painting;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_f"></a>(f)     a painting bearing the name “R
                        Bonnet”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_g"></a>(g)     a painting bearing the name “Soejano”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_h"></a>(h)     a painting bearing the name
                        “Arie Smith”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_i"></a>(i)     a painting purportedly signed by Chen Yi Fei, whom the
                        second defendant allegedly described as a “famous painter whom [the
                        plaintiff] would know”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Later that evening, the defendants visited the
                    plaintiff and Mr Huang at their home to determine the price of the
                    additional ten paintings and to collect payment. The first defendant reiterated
                    that he would give the plaintiff a full refund if either she or Mr Huang
                    was not satisfied with the purchase. According to the plaintiff, the first
                    defendant said that “$150,000 was very cheap for such famous
                    painters.” The plaintiff then paid the first defendant $150,000 for these
                    works (“the second agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Sometime around the end of September 2008,
                    Mr Huang sent four paintings to Sotheby’s for an assessment of their
                    authenticity. They were the purported Affandi paintings purchased under the
                    first agreement, and the purported Walter Spies, Antiono Blanco and R Bonnet
                    paintings purchased under the second agreement. According to Mr Huang,
                    Sotheby’s subsequently informed him that all the paintings were
                    counterfeits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The third set of paintings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Soon after, sometime in October 2008, the
                    second defendant contacted Mr Huang regarding a third set of six paintings
                    (“the third set”). It was alleged that she represented that
                        “<em>for sure these are originals</em>”.
                    Mr Huang agreed to view the third set because if they were original
                    paintings, he intended to acquire them in exchange for the counterfeit artworks
                    purchased under the first and second agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 20 October 2008, the second defendant and
                    one Mr Michael Ngor took the third set to the plaintiff’s home
                    (“the 20 October 2008 meeting”). At the start of the meeting,
                    Mr Huang took out a hand-held video recorder and recorded all the paintings
                    that the second defendant had brought. He then placed the video recorder on a
                    shelf to record what was being said by the second defendant. At this meeting,
                    the second defendant made a number of representations regarding the authenticity
                    of the paintings. However, Mr Huang was unconvinced and he wanted to verify
                    the authenticity of the paintings before purchasing them. As such, no agreement
                    was reached on the sale and purchase of the third set.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The next day, the plaintiff and Mr Huang
                    took one of the paintings from the third set, which was purportedly by the
                    artist Wu Guanzhong, to Professor Arthur Lim, a well-known eye surgeon and art
                    collector. After assessing the painting, Professor Arthur Lim concluded that it
                    was not an original work by Wu Guanzhong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr Huang then requested that the second
                    defendant come to his home to take back all the artwork purchased from the first
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 21 or 22 October 2008, Mr Huang
                    telephoned the second defendant and said that he did not believe that the
                    paintings in the third set were originals. He declined to purchase them. He also
                    told her that at least some of the paintings sold to the plaintiff under the
                    first and second agreements were not original works. Mr Huang asked her to
                    inform the first defendant that he and the plaintiff wanted a full refund of the
                    $300,000 paid for the 19 paintings and one wood carving (“the
                    Artworks”) purchased under the first and second agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The undertaking</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Subsequently, the second defendant informed
                    Mr Huang that the first defendant would keep his promise to refund the
                    $300,000 but had asked to be given one year to return the money as he was in a
                    poor financial state. The plaintiff and Mr Huang sympathised with the first
                    defendant and decided to accede to his request for more time to return the
                    $300,000. They, however, wanted evidence of his commitment. Therefore,
                    Mr Huang drafted a letter of undertaking (“the Written
                    Undertaking”) which <em>inter alia</em>
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I, Mr Tong Djoe, hereby promise to return the above-mentioned
                        S$300,000.00 (Singapore Dollars Three Hundred Thousand Only) in CASH to Dr
                        Xiaoyan Baumann latest by 1st August 2009. Upon returning the $300,000.00
                        (Singapore Dollars Three Hundred Thousand Only) to Dr Baumann, Dr Baumann
                        shall return back to Mr Tong Djoe the above mentioned 19 (nineteen)
                        paintings plus 1 (one) wood carving. Photographs of all these 19 (nineteen)
                        paintings plus 1 (one) wooden carving are attached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Written Undertaking was also translated into Mandarin as the
                    plaintiff and Mr Huang wanted to ensure that the first defendant understood
                    the obligations it contained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 4 November 2008, the defendants met the
                    plaintiff and Mr Huang to resolve the matter. The plaintiff and
                    Mr Huang confronted the defendants about the misrepresentations regarding
                    the authenticity of the Artworks. The plaintiff then orally rescinded the first
                    and second agreements and demanded her money back. According to her, the first
                    defendant reiterated that he was encountering a “cash-flow
                    problem” and could only return the money in August 2009. He added that
                    the Plaintiff and Mr Huang could keep the Artworks as security for the
                    $300,000. Mr Huang then handed the first defendant the Written Undertaking.
                    It was signed by the first defendant. The Written Undertaking is dated 4
                    November 2008 and bears the signatures of the plaintiff and the first defendant,
                    and that of Mr Huang as witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At the end of the 4 November 2008 meeting, the
                    first defendant took back the third set. The loading of these paintings into a
                    van was witnessed by Stephen Wong Ji Kin, the security guard on duty that
                    evening at the plaintiff’s apartment block.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to this action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     When the deadline for repayment expired on 1
                    August 2009, the first defendant had failed to pay the plaintiff the sum of
                    $300,000 or any part thereof. On 11 August 2009, the plaintiff sent the
                    following text messages to both the defendants asking them to return the
                    money:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tong Joo,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am Cheryl. You ought to have returned SGD 300,000 to us on 1st of
                        August. When can we collect the money from your place? How about tomorrow?
                        We have already waited for a year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As the plaintiff did not receive a response,
                    she engaged solicitors to recover her money. On 19 August 2009, the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors wrote a letter of demand demanding the return of
                    $300,000 and interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The first defendant’s solicitors replied
                    by way of letter dated 10 September 2009 and denied that the first defendant had
                    made any representations regarding the authenticity of the Artworks. The first
                    defendant asserted that there was a sum of $500,000 due and owing from the
                    plaintiff to him for the third set, which he alleged had not been returned to
                    him. The first defendant further alleged that the plaintiff was in breach of the
                    Written Undertaking for not returning the Artworks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 16 September 2009, the first defendant
                    commenced Suit No 792 of 2009 (“Suit 792”) against the plaintiff
                    in which he claimed, <em>inter alia</em>, the sum of
                    $500,000 as being due and owing to him for the third set. On 18 September 2009,
                    the plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendants, for <em>inter alia</em>, the return of the sum of
                $300,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Subsequently, it was agreed between the first
                    defendant and the plaintiff that the first defendant would discontinue Suit 792
                    and instead include a counterclaim for the sum of $500,000 in the present
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the statement of claim, the plaintiff
                    alleged that the first and/or the second defendant had committed fraudulent
                    misrepresentation and/or had been guilty of deceit in respect of the plaintiff.
                    Paragraph 33.1 of the statement of claim sets out the representations allegedly
                    made by the first and second defendants with regard to the first agreement and
                    para 33.2 sets out the representations allegedly made with regard to the second
                    agreement. The plaintiff averred that these representations were made
                    fraudulently in that the defendants knew that the representations were false or
                    they were reckless in making them not caring whether they were true or false. As
                    a result of the fraudulent misrepresentations, the plaintiff was induced into
                    entering the first and second agreements and purchasing the
                Artworks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the alternative, the plaintiff relied on
                    the provisions of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed). In the
                    further alternative, the plaintiff pleaded that the first and/or second
                    defendants made negligent misrepresentations which induced her to enter into the
                    first and second agreements. She further alleged that it was a fundamental term
                    of the agreements that all the Artworks were originals and that this term was
                    breached by the first defendant. The plaintiff further pleaded, as against the
                    first defendant, that he failed, neglected or refused to pay the sum due and
                    owing under the Written Undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The reliefs claimed by the plaintiff include
                    the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     a declaration that she has validly
                        rescinded the first and second agreements; alternatively rescission of the
                        same;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     return of
                        the sum of $300,000; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     damages to be assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The first defendant has amended his pleadings
                    several times. The key averments in the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No
                    2) dated 9 April 2010 filed jointly on behalf of the first and second defendants
                    were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    At no time did the 1st Defendant agree that in the
                            event that any of the paintings or art pieces were not authentic, he
                            would refund all the monies back to the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    There was no discussion of the [third set] and as
                            there was no mention of this in the written undertaking, the Plaintiff
                            was thus obliged to pay the said sum of $500,000 as the Plaintiff
                            continued to retain these paintings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    Consequently, as the written undertaking did not
                            incorporate all the Terms in the Third Transaction, it did not
                            constitute a binding agreement between the Plaintiff and the 1st
                            Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 2 November 2010, the second defendant,
                    having instructed new solicitors, filed a separate Defence on her own behalf.
                    She distanced herself from the first defendant and admitted that the third set
                    had been returned to the first defendant. She averred that the transactions had
                    been between the first defendant and the plaintiff and Mr Huang and had
                    nothing to do with her as she had been the first defendant’s personal
                    assistant at all material times. She denied making the alleged representations
                    set out in the statement of claim. She also denied that the plaintiff was
                    induced by anything she had said to buy the Artworks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The first defendant also changed solicitors.
                    Subsequently, the plaintiff received a letter dated 10 December 2010 from the
                    first defendant’s new solicitors enclosing a Notice to Deliver, which
                    stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I, Tong Djoe @ Tong Lian Joo, holder of NRIC [XXX] of 70 Anson Road,
                        #27-00, Singapore hereby give you notice that I want you to return all 19
                        paintings and 1 wood carving identified in the Letter of Undertaking dated 3
                        November 2008 specifically referred to in Suit 804 of 2009/J in the High
                        Court of Singapore in the state and condition that they were delivered to
                        you within 10 days from the date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By prior appointment, I will hand over in exchange to you a Banker’s
                        guarantee, a copy of which is attached hereto, to assure you of full payment
                        of $300,000-00 under the terms of my Letter of Undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And upon the delivery of the said 19 paintings and 1 wood carving, in the
                        state and condition when they were handed to you, the Bank guarantee will be
                        released together with an acknowledgement of receipt from me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon receiving your intention to deliver the 19 paintings and 1 wood
                        craving [sic], I will arrange for the Banker’s guarantee to be
                        available in 3 working days for the exchange at my office #27-00, 70 Anson
                        Road, Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please be informed I would like to emphasize that should the above 19
                        paintings and 1 wood carving are not in the state and condition they were
                        handed over to you by me or not delivered within the stipulated time, I will
                        hold you in breach of the terms of the Settlement of 4 November 2008 and
                        will seek the appropriate relief from the court or alternatively for damages
                        suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The first defendant then filed a further
                    amended pleading. By his Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 3) dated 24
                    December 2010 (“Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 3)”),
                    he:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     admitted that the [Artworks were]
                        sold to the plaintiff on the understanding that she was entitled to be
                        reimbursed by him with her purchase price of $300,000 if she was not
                        satisfied;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     changed his initial position that the Written Undertaking was not a binding
                        agreement and averred instead that the Written Undertaking was a full and
                        final settlement agreement and that the plaintiff had compromised her
                        original causes of action, including misrepresentation;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     dropped his counterclaim for $500,000
                        or any damage arising out of the plaintiff’s breach of contract for
                        the sale and purchase of the third set; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)     added a counterclaim for damages arising from
                        breach of the Written Undertaking based on the plaintiff’s failure to
                        deliver the Artwork under the Notice to Deliver.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As a result of the significant changes in the
                    first defendant’s defence and counterclaim referred to above, the issues
                    before me have been reduced to the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     given that the first defendant
                        accepted that he was obliged to reimburse the plaintiff with the purchase
                        money paid by her if she was not satisfied, did he breach the terms of the
                        Written Undertaking?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     was the plaintiff obliged to comply with the first defendant’s
                        Notice to Deliver dated 9 December 2010 <em>ie</em> was
                        the plaintiff obliged to return the Artworks before she could claim the
                        reimbursement of her payment?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the Written Undertaking was a full and final
                        settlement agreement which extinguished the plaintiff’s other causes
                        of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At the outset, it is worth noting that the
                    first defendant did not take the stand for cross-examination and therefore his
                    affidavit of evidence in chief could not be received in evidence without the
                    leave of court pursuant to O 38 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2006 Rev
                    Ed). No such leave was sought on behalf of the first defendant. No other
                    witnesses were called on his behalf either. Thus, he did not adduce any evidence
                    in answer to the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff. As the first
                    defendant did not adduce evidence, the plaintiff only needs to adduce <em>prima facie</em> evidence supporting the elements of her
                    claim (see <em>Central Bank of India v Hemant Govindprasad
                        Bansal</em> [2002] 3 SLR 190 at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The first defendant was obliged under the
                    Written Undertaking to return the $300,000 by 1 August 2009. The first
                    defendant’s argument that the plaintiff’s demand for the return of
                    the $300,000 was not in accordance with the Written Undertaking as the plaintiff
                    did not express any intention to return the Artworks despite oral requests made
                    for the return of the same is untenable. No evidence was led to show that the
                    first defendant made oral requests for the return of the Artworks. More
                    importantly, the Written Undertaking expressly states that it is only <em>upon</em> the first defendant returning the plaintiff
                    $300,000 in cash that the plaintiff would be obliged to hand over the Artworks
                    to the first defendant. Additionally, the emphasis that the first defendant
                    placed on being entitled to <em>inspect</em> the Artworks
                    before paying the plaintiff is incredible considering that the Written
                    Undertaking contains no such term. Undoubtedly, the first defendant has breached
                    the terms of the Written Undertaking by failing to pay the plaintiff $300,000 by
                    1 August 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     There is no doubt that the Written Undertaking
                    constituted a binding contract because it was signed by the first defendant in
                    consideration of the plaintiff’s agreement not to enforce the return of
                    the $300,000 immediately but to give him time to pay up till 1 August 2009.
                    Accordingly, the plaintiff was not obliged to comply with the Notice to Deliver
                    as it was inconsistent with the Written Undertaking. Under the Written
                    Undertaking, the first defendant was obliged to pay the plaintiff cash. It was
                    never contemplated that the refund would be in the form of a bank guarantee
                    conditional on the first defendant acknowledging that the Artworks were in the
                    state and condition that they were in when they were handed to the plaintiff. As
                    the plaintiff argued, if the first defendant’s position is correct, there
                    is nothing to stop him from claiming that the Artworks were not in the condition
                    they were in when they were handed to him, and using this excuse to refuse to
                    refund the $300,000. The first defendant’s counterclaim for damages for
                    being “deprived of the possession” of the Artworks arising from
                    the plaintiff’s alleged breach of the Written Undertaking is clearly
                    unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The first defendant also damaged his
                    credibility as he had initially claimed that the Written Undertaking was not a
                    binding agreement but subsequently changed his position and claimed that it was
                    a full and final settlement of the plaintiff’s claim against him. In any
                    event, on the evidence adduced, it is clear that the Written Undertaking was not
                    a full and final settlement/compromise agreement. The circumstances under which
                    the Written Undertaking was drafted as set out in the testimony of the plaintiff
                    and Mr Huang (which was not refuted by the first defendant) showed that the
                    purpose of the document was to record the plaintiff’s acceptance of first
                    defendant’s request for more time for payment. The plaintiff did not
                    compromise the amount of the claim or the basis of the claim in any way. What
                    she did was simply to agree not to enforce immediate recovery. The wording of
                    the Written Undertaking reflects this. The document does not state that it is a
                    full and final settlement. Rather, the Written Undertaking appears to be no more
                    than a written acknowledgement, or an “IOU” of sorts, stating that
                    the first defendant owes the plaintiff the full purchase price of $300,000 and
                    promising to make payment of the same by 1 August 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     There is no doubt that the plaintiff has
                    established, at the very least, a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    against the first defendant. As such, the plaintiff is entitled to a refund of
                    the purchase price of $300,000 and to interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum as
                    from 2 August 2009. As regards the plaintiff’s claim for a rescission of
                    the first and second agreements, this is not required because it was the
                    plaintiff’s position that, as part of the agreements, the first defendant
                    had agreed from the beginning to refund her the purchase price if she was not
                    satisfied with the Artworks. That being the case, the plaintiff can have her
                    remedy of repayment without the need for rescission. The plaintiff also made an
                    alternative claim for damages. Such a relief is not appropriate since the
                    plaintiff’s claim herein was basically a claim for a liquidated sum and
                    the damages recoverable in respect of such a claim are constituted by the award
                    of interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s case against the second defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff’s cause of action against
                    the second defendant is for negligent misrepresentation. The issues are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the second defendant made
                        the alleged misrepresentations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether a duty of care ought to be imposed on the second

                        in a storeroom at a club at Ang Siang Hill were original works by Affandi
                        (“Affandi Representation”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     the second defendant orally represented to
                        Mr Huang that a painting was an original by Xu Bei Hong (“XBH

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     with respect to a painting of a Chinese lady holding a
                        fan bearing the signature of Chen Yi Fei, the second defendant orally
                        represented that the said artist was “a famous painter whom [the

                    second defendant represented that the first defendant “would never buy
                    fakes”. As supporting evidence, she relied on the transcripts of the
                    meeting on 20 October 2008 which showed that the second defendant had made the

<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff contended that the second defendant also represented
                    that the Wu Guanzhong and the Walter Spies paintings that the first
                    defendant had were original works. She argued that given the approach taken by
                    the second defendant regarding the third set, this court can and should infer
                    that she made similar representations to the plaintiff and Mr Huang
                    regarding the Artworks at the first and second meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The second defendant denied making any of the
                    representations. She contended that apart from the plaintiff’s and

                    evidence to prove that the second defendant did in fact make these

<p class="Judg-1">Whilst the second defendant emphatically denied that she had used the
                    word “originals” to describe the paintings by Affandi, the obvious
                    implication of what she admitted to have told Mr Huang was that the whole
                    stack of paintings which she was showing him comprised original works by
                    Affandi. I find that this representation has been proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As for the XBH Representation, the second
                    defendant argued that there was no evidence that she had made this
                    representation at all. In Mr Huang’s affidavit of evidence in chief,
                    he had said at para 24(v):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A portrait of a man (which I later learnt was a self-portrait of
                        Rembrandt) which the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant orally
                        represented was a painting by <b><u>Xu Bei
                        Hong</u></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first defendant submitted that Mr Huang’s evidence had
                    stated without qualification that the XBH Representation had come from the first
                    defendant and he had made no reference to the second defendant as having made
                    this representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff’s response was that the
                    description “1<sup>st</sup> Defendant” in para
                    24(v) was an obvious typographical error and that it was clear all along that
                    Mr Huang had been referring to a statement from the second defendant rather
                    than from the first defendant. The plaintiff also noted that the fact that the
                    second defendant had made a representation to Mr Huang regarding the
                    authenticity of the Xu Bei Hong in question had been specifically put to her

<p class="Judg-1">Counsel for the second defendant did not object to this line of
                    examination. The plaintiff submitted that the argument made by the second
                    defendant was an attempt to take advantage of a clerical error in
                    Mr Huang’s affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I find it difficult to accept the submission
                    that the reference to the first defendant in para 24(v) of Mr Huang’s
                    affidavit was a typographical error and that the plain intention was to refer to
                    the second defendant and such intention would have been obvious to anyone
                    reading the affidavit. Paragraph 24 appears in a section of the affidavit headed
                    “The 2<sup>nd</sup> Agreement” and deals with
                    events occurring on 21 September 2008. Paragraph 24 recounts what happened after
                    the second defendant and Mr Huang had visited the storeroom in Ang Siang
                    Hill. It starts:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant then told me that if I was
                        interested in the rest of the shipment, we should proceed to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s office. The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and I proceeded to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s office. The
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant then showed me various
                        paintings and asked me to pick the paintings that I liked. Soon after, we
                        were joined by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant who also asked
                        me to select the artwork which caught my eye. In addition to the 2 Affandis
                        I had selected earlier that day, I selected 10 other pieces of artwork (8
                        paintings and 2 sketches). ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">After this introduction, there are nine sub-paragraphs each dealing
                    with different artworks shown to Mr Huang by the first and the second
                    defendant in the first defendant’s office. It must be emphasised that the
                    paragraph deals with a time when both defendants were showing Mr Huang
                    items and talking to him about them. In three of the sub-paragraphs,
                    Mr Huang refers to statements made about the paintings to him by the first
                    defendant. Apart from sub-para 24(v) quoted above, he also refers to the first
                    defendant in sub-paras 24(vi) and (ix):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(vi)  A painting of a women [<em>sic</em>] praying with a description attached to the back of
                            the painting stating that the painting was titled ‘<em>The Temple</em>’ which the
                                1<sup>st</sup> Defendant orally represented as being
                            the work of <b><u>Wai Ming</u></b> whom the
                                1<sup>st</sup> Defendant described as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(ix)  A painting which the

                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the other hand, there is a specific reference to the second
                    defendant in only one sub-paragraph <em>viz</em> para
                    24(xi):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(xi)  A painting of a Chinese lady holding a fan with
                            the purported signature of <b><u>Chen Yi Fei</u></b>
                            at the bottom right-hand corner of the painting whom the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant described as
                                ‘<em>being a famous painter whom your wife
                                would know</em>’ ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     From a study of Mr Huang’s
                    affidavit, it is not apparent that the reference to the first defendant in para
                    24(v) was a typographical error. As noted above, both defendants were present at
                    the time the XBH Representation was made and there is no reason why the second
                    defendant rather than the first defendant as identified in the affidavit should
                    have made this representation. Mr Huang clearly testified in that paragraph
                    of the affidavit to various statements made to him by the first defendant in his
                    office that evening and only testified to one statement made by the second
                    defendant when she was in the presence of the first defendant. In the
                    circumstances, I accept the second defendant’s submission that there was
                    no evidence that she made the XBH Representation. The fact that her counsel did
                    not object when the plaintiff’s counsel asked the second defendant whether
                    she had made the representation does not amount to evidence contradicting her
                    denial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As for the other two representations, since
                    all the evidence is oral, I have the classic problem of weighing each
                    party’s evidence and deciding whom to believe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The No-fakes Representation was allegedly made
                    to both the plaintiff and Mr Huang whilst the CYF Representation was made
                    to Mr Huang alone. Their evidence on these representations was not shaken
                    in cross-examination. The second defendant did not challenge the credibility of
                    either the plaintiff or Mr Huang. She was content to submit that the
                    plaintiff’s and Mr Huang’s assertions were not supported by any
                    other evidence adduced by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the other hand, the plaintiff did challenge
                    the second defendant’s credibility. The plaintiff submitted that the
                    second defendant’s testimony was riddled with contradictions and, in
                    addition, she had changed positions in her pleadings. The plaintiff relied on
                    the transcripts of the 20 October 2008 meeting to show that the second defendant
                    was a garrulous person who made numerous representations regarding the
                    authenticity of the first defendant’s paintings. Yet, in the second
                    defendant’s testimony, she had chosen to describe her conversation with
                    Mr Huang on 20 October 2008 as nothing more than “small chit-chat
                    from time to time”. These were the same words that she used in her
                    affidavit to describe what had transpired when she met Mr Huang at Ang
                    Siang Hill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff submitted that during the 20
                    October 2008 meeting, the second defendant had made various representations
                    about works included in the third set. She said, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     with respect to one of the purported
                        Wu Guanzhong paintings in the third set, that Wu Guanzhong “gave it
                        to Mr. Tong Joo[<em>sic</em>] when he came down to
                        Singapore ... in the year 1993”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     when discussing Walter Spies, the second
                        defendant stated that “you see, so he said he can sell you this price
                        because he bought it at a very cheap price in the past, but he did not know
                        the price today until lately” and that “yes, he [the first
                        defendant] said all walter sphere [<em>sic</em>] he
                        bought from his son”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     in addition, when asked about how the first defendant had
                        so many Walter Spies paintings, she replied “He has so many, this is
                        long ago, not popular. In the years 70s, 60s or 50s. He shows you what the
                        thing, in the year 1948 he bought”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff
                    submitted that in those statements, the second defendant was clearly implying
                    that the paintings she referred to then were original works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Whilst I accept the logic of the second
                    defendant’s submission that one cannot prove what she said on earlier
                    occasions by reference to what she said on 20 October 2008, that does not mean
                    that the transcript showing what transpired on 20 October 2008 has no probative
                    value at all. It does establish that the second defendant was talkative and was
                    willing to make all sorts of assertions about the paintings belonging to the
                    first defendant. In that transcript, she had also said that the first defendant
                    had kept his paintings for a very long time and that he was able to sell at a
                    low price because he had bought them at a low price as well. The way that the
                    second defendant was willing to discuss the first defendant’s collection
                    and his motivation on 20 October 2008 makes it more likely that she had been
                    equally willing to say similar things about the paintings that she had
                    previously shown Mr Huang and the plaintiff. In coming to this conclusion,
                    I am aware that when Mr Huang mentioned during that meeting that if fakes
                    were sold, the first defendant would get into trouble, the second defendant
                    replied by saying “no fake lah” and when Mr Huang asked her
                    whether she knew for sure that there were no fakes, her reply was “I
                    think is not fake, for what he wants to sell fake things like what you say
                    correct or not”. This qualification, however, does not reduce the
                    inherent likelihood of her having earlier made the CYF Representation or the
                    No-fakes Representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     As the plaintiff pointed out, the difference
                    in the second defendant’s approach during the meeting on 20 October 2008
                    when she was trying to sell the third set and her approach in her affidavit was
                    stark. In the affidavit, she claimed that she would never answer questions about
                    the authenticity of the paintings. At paras 33 and 34 of her affidavit she had
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33.    I did not at any time in the sale and purchase of
                            the Purchased Artworks, made any representations, whether fraudulently
                            or recklessly, of whatsoever nature, as regards the authenticity of any
                            of the Purchased Artworks to [the plaintiff] or [Mr Huang]
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34.    As I was merely Tong Djoe’s personal
                            assistant, Tong Djoe did not authorise me to make any representations as
                            regards the authenticity of any of Purchased Artworks on behalf of
                            himself. Due to this, I would not have said to [the plaintiff] or
                            [Mr Huang] any matter which I did not have the authorization from
                            Tong Djoe to say, and in any regard, I did not say anything to [the
                            plaintiff] or [Mr Huang] that Tong Djoe would not himself had
                                [<em>sic</em>] said to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">During the meeting of 20 October 2008, however, she had talked
                    about the Wu Guanzhong painting and the Walter Spies paintings quite
                    freely. During cross-examination, she admitted that when asked whether a
                    painting was an original, she would say that it was “not fake” and
                    she tried to explain this away by saying that in her view, art could never be
                    fake unlike gold and diamonds. This is shown by the following exchange:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The second defendant must have realised the inconsistencies between
                    her affidavit evidence and what she had said on 20 October 2008 and during
                    cross-examination and therefore she sought to play down her statements by
                    emphasising her lack of education and asserting that in the nature of art,
                    paintings could not be faked since each painting had to be painted by an
                    artist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Further, the second defendant was inconsistent
                    in other areas of her evidence. At first she had asserted that Mr Huang was
                    the first person to whom she had shown the first defendant’s paintings
                    with a view to their sale. Subsequently, the second defendant was shown an
                    affidavit which she had filed in a district court case where, referring to a
                    different transaction which took place before the one in question in these
                    proceedings, she had said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This was the first time I had shown people to view the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s collection and assisted
                        in such a purchase of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s
                        collection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When confronted with this affidavit during cross-examination, the
                    second defendant’s first reaction was to blame her lawyers and say that
                    she had affirmed the affidavit when she was sick and the first defendant was
                    present at the time. Subsequently, she had called the lawyer in that case and
                    asked the lawyer to change the affidavit. Under repeated questioning in this
                    case, however, the second defendant finally admitted that Mr Huang was not
                    the first person to whom she had shown the first defendant’s
                    paintings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The second defendant also told different
                    stories in relation to the visit to Ang Siang Hill. At first, she said that the
                    paintings in those premises were kept in a storeroom and that she did not go
                    into the storeroom because she could not breathe in there. Later, she said that
                    the paintings were kept along a place which she described as “a pathway
                    of the ... house”. She elaborated that there was no going into a room or
                    standing outside the room because as soon as you entered the house there was a
                    pathway where the paintings were kept. Subsequently, she changed again and said
                    “Yah, it’s a pathway, but there are also store room, you
                    see”. Finally, she decided that the better word to describe the area
                    where the paintings were kept was “corridor”. In her Defence and
                    Counterclaim (Amendment No 3), however, the second defendant had pleaded that
                    she had met Mr Huang at a storeroom in Ang Siang Hill and that her role
                    “was simply to unlock the storeroom for the viewing of paintings by
                    Mr Huang”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     When the discrepancy between her evidence and
                    her pleading was pointed out to the second defendant, she said that what was
                    written in her defence was not in accordance with what she had told her lawyers.
                    She then claimed that she had been sick when she had given instructions to her
                    lawyers. Upon further cross-examination, however, she admitted that by the time
                    she instructed the solicitors who had drafted her Defence and Counterclaim
                    (Amendment No 3) she had recovered from her illness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Having considered the evidence, I find the
                    plaintiff and Mr Huang’s evidence on the No-fakes Representation and
                    the CYF Representation to be more credible than that of the second defendant. I
                    accept that the second defendant made both these representations in addition to
                    the Affandi Representation. The second defendant’s credibility on several
                    points was doubtful as I have noted above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the second defendant owe the plaintiff a duty of care?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I have found that the second defendant made
                    three representations in the course of the plaintiff’s purchase of the
                    Artworks. The plaintiff’s case is that all three representations were
                    false and she is seeking to hold the second defendant liable for negligent
                    misrepresentation in tort. The second defendant did not seek to challenge the
                    assertion that the representations were false. However, she maintains that
                    nonetheless, legally, she is not liable in tort for misrepresentation to the
                    plaintiff. The legal basis of the claim must therefore be
                considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Trans-World (Aluminium)
                        Ltd v Cornelder China (Singapore)</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 501,
                    Belinda Ang J followed and endorsed the principles of liability for negligent
                    mis-statement as set out in <em>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v
                        Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</em> [1964] AC 465 and <em>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</em> [1990]
                    2 AC 605 (“<em>Caparo</em>”).
                    Basically, there must be a special relationship of proximity between the person
                    making the statements and the recipient who acts in reliance on the statements.
                    In <em>Caparo</em>, Lord Oliver stated that such a
                    relationship may typically be held to exist where (1) the advice is required for
                    a purpose made known to the advisor at the time the advice is given, (2) the
                    advisor knows that the advice would be communicated to the advisee so that it
                    would be used for that purpose, (3) it is known that the advice is likely to be
                    acted upon without independent inquiry and (4) it is so acted upon by the
                    advisee to his detriment. When the relationship of proximity exists between the
                    parties, then the advisor will owe a duty of care to the advisee not to give
                    negligent advice. The second element required for liability is reliance and this
                    means that the advisee must show that he or she relied on the advice and was
                    acting reasonably in doing so. In the House of Lords decision of <em>Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd</em> [1998]
                    1 WLR 830 (“<em>Williams</em>”)
                    Lord Steyn stated that the “test is not simply reliance in fact”
                    but whether the plaintiff could reasonably rely on the assumption of personal
                    responsibility by the individual who performed the services on behalf of the
                    company (at 837).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiff relied on <em>White v Jones</em> [1995] 2 AC 207 (“<em>White v Jones</em>”), where it was held that a
                    solicitor who failed to draw up the will of a client before his death owed a
                    duty of care to the would-be beneficiaries under the new will, and was liable to
                    them as they were unable to claim their inheritance. Lord Browne-Wilkinson said
                    (at 273):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The assumption of responsibility referred to is the defendant’s
                        assumption of responsibility for the task, not the assumption of legal
                        liability. <em>Even in the case of ad hoc relationships, it
                            is the undertaking to answer the questions posed which creates the
                            relationship</em>. If the responsibility for the task is assumed
                        by the defendant, he thereby creates a special relationship between himself
                        and the plaintiff in relation to which the law (not the defendant) attaches
                        a duty to carry out carefully the task so assumed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff asserted that by choosing to answer
                    Mr Huang’s questions regarding the Artworks, the second defendant had
                    voluntarily assumed responsibility towards her. She argued that, even on her own
                    case, the second defendant had stated during cross-examination that if asked
                    whether an art piece was an original, she would say that it was not a
                    fake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The second defendant responded that she did
                    not assume responsibility towards the plaintiff as she had told Mr Huang to
                    direct his queries on authenticity to the first defendant. Furthermore, she made
                    it plain that she did not have special knowledge and was not an expert in art.
                    She relied on <em>Edgeworth Construction Ltd v N.D Lea &amp;
                        Associates Ltd</em> (1993)
                        107 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 169
                        (“<em>Edgeworth Construction</em>”),
                    where the Supreme Court of Canada found that individual employees (in that case,
                    engineers) did not owe a duty although their employer did. La Forest J
                    reasoned (at pg 9) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While they [the individual engineers], in one sense, have expected that
                        persons in the position of the appellant would rely on their work, they
                        would expect that the appellant would place reliance on their firm’s
                        pocketbook and not theirs for indemnification… Looked at the other
                        way, the appellant could not reasonably rely for indemnification on the
                        individual engineers. It would have to show that it was relying on the
                        particular expertise of an individual engineer without regard to the
                        corporate character of the engineering firm. It would seem quite
                        unrealistic… to hold that the mere presence of an individual
                        engineer’s seal was sufficient indication of personal reliance (or for
                        that matter voluntary assumption of risk).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second defendant also cited <em>Williams</em>
                    and submitted that it was not reasonable for the plaintiff to rely on her
                    statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In order to determine whether the necessary
                    proximity existed and if so whether it was reasonable for the plaintiff to rely
                    on what the second defendant said, it is necessary to revisit the facts. The
                    circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the Artworks and the context in
                    which the representations were made are the most important of these
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     From the start, the plaintiff and
                    Mr Huang knew that they were going to see a private collection.
                    Mr Huang was given the opportunity to do this by Mr Chin who told him
                    that his mother, the second defendant, was the personal assistant of a well
                    known businessman and art collector. Therefore, Mr Huang initially, and
                    thereafter the plaintiff, met the second defendant in her capacity as the
                    personal assistant of a businessman. This businessman was not running an art
                    gallery and the second defendant was not working in an art gallery or a museum.
                    The first defendant was selling his own private collection which he had built up
                    over many years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     According to Mr Huang’s evidence,
                    on his first visit to the first defendant’s office, Mr Huang met the
                    first defendant who told him that he (<em>ie</em> the first
                    defendant) was a successful businessman who had been collecting paintings for
                    many years and that he had purchased most of the paintings from the artists
                    directly. The first defendant showed Mr Huang the art collection and
                    specifically showed him a painting which he claimed was an original work by
                    Picasso. He asked if Mr Huang wanted to buy any of the paintings as he
                    needed the money. The first defendant then took Mr Huang to a corner of the
                    office and asked him to pick a few paintings that the latter liked. The first
                    defendant said that prices could be discussed later. Mr Huang chose a few
                    paintings and the first defendant made certain representations about them. He
                    then asked Mr Huang to name a price. He was not willing, however, to accept
                    the price named by Mr Huang and stated that the least he could accept was
                    $150,000 as the Artworks were all original and were worth a lot
                more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It is clear from the account given by
                    Mr Huang that it was the first defendant who was driving the sale. He made
                    representations about his collection and about how long he had had the
                    paintings. He also said he had purchased many of the Artworks directly from the
                    artists. The second defendant acted more as an echo than an originator of the
                    representations. Even when the plaintiff went to see the first defendant a few
                    hours later, the first defendant repeated his assertions that all the Artworks
                    were originals and that he would never collect counterfeits and that if any of
                    the items was counterfeit he would return all the money to the plaintiff.
                    According to Mr Huang, it was at that stage that the second defendant
                    reiterated that the first defendant would “never purchase fakes”
                        (<em>ie</em> that was when she made the No-fakes
                    Representation).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The accounts given by Mr Huang and the
                    plaintiff make it obvious that the second defendant’s role was to assist
                    the first defendant by showing the paintings to prospective purchasers. She
                    performed this function during the first meeting and again during the visit to
                    Ang Siang Hill which the first defendant did not attend. He remained in his
                    office and sent the second defendant out to run around for him as necessary. He
                    did this again on 20 October 2008 when it was the second defendant who had the
                    task of carting the third set to Mr Huang’s home and displaying them
                    there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The second defendant did not claim to possess
                    any special skills in the field of art. In fact, at the 20 October 2008 meeting,
                    the second defendant reiterated that she did not know about art:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Both the plaintiff and Mr Huang admitted
                    that the second defendant did not state that she was an expert in art. The
                    authors of <em>Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</em>, Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 2010, 20<sup>th</sup> Ed, observed at pg 501 para
                    8-118:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [I]t remains the case that a claimant is <em>much more
                            likely to be able to show that he is entitled to depend on a service or
                            statement where the work is undertaken by a person who is exercising a
                            special skill in a business context. This is particularly the case where
                            the information being given relates to matters which are within the
                            exclusive preserve of the defendant</em>. Thus in <em>Smith v Eric S Bush</em> [1990] 1 AC 831 Lord Griffiths
                        commented: “the valuer is discharging the duties of a professional
                        man... The essence of the case against him is that he as a professional man
                        realised that the purchaser was relying on him to exercise proper skill and
                        judgment in his profession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second defendant was known to them only as the first
                    defendant’s assistant who performed the tasks he assigned to her and at no
                    time were they told that she had any expertise in this area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     On a consideration of the evidence, I find
                    that on balance, the second defendant did not voluntarily assume responsibility
                    for advising the plaintiff. She was merely repeating things that the first
                    defendant said and was acting as his assistant to help him in achieving the
                    sales. Whilst she did earn some extra money from him when he made a successful
                    sale, this incentive in itself does not mean that she was acting with
                    professional knowledge or that she was someone whose statements could be
                    accepted as independently verifying what the first defendant was telling the
                    plaintiff and Mr Huang. It must have been clear to them after their
                    experience with the first defendant that, enthusiastic as the second defendant
                    was, she was parroting her boss and not conveying her own opinions gained from
                    her own knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Furthermore, even if it is assumed that the
                    second defendant voluntarily assumed responsibility, the plaintiff’s claim
                    nonetheless fails the proximity test because it would not have been reasonable
                    in the circumstances for the plaintiff to rely on the representations made by
                    the second defendant in making her decision to purchase the Artworks. As noted
                    above, in <em>Williams</em>, where the House of Lords held
                    that the claimants who were customers of a company could not reasonably have
                    looked to the defendant director of the company for an indemnity, Lord Steyn
                    endorsed the view of La Forest J in <em>Edgeworth
                        Construction</em> and stressed the need for reasonable
                    reliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the present case, it is far more likely
                    that the plaintiff and Mr Huang relied on and were influenced by the
                    guarantee of the first defendant, who was supposedly a prominent businessman and
                    an ardent art collector. After all, at the 17 September 2008 evening meeting,
                    the plaintiff had specifically asked the first defendant whether the art pieces
                    were originals and the first defendant had assured her that they were and that
                    he would never collect counterfeits. Thereafter, the first defendant <em>reiterated that if the art pieces were not originals he would
                        return the monies to them</em>. Obviously, it was his unequivocal
                    guarantee that persuaded the plaintiff to purchase the Artworks. When the owner
                    of an artwork which he is selling makes such a promise, it is hardly likely that
                    a purchaser would rely on that seller’s employee’s endorsement in
                    deciding to buy the work in question. If the second defendant’s alleged
                    representations had really induced the plaintiff to enter the first and second
                    Agreements, surely she would have also have been made a party to the Written
                    Undertaking? At the time the plaintiff asked for the Written Undertaking to be
                    executed, she gave no hint that she held the second defendant legally
                    responsible as well for what had occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In the event, I hold that the second defendant
                    did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care and therefore cannot be made liable for
                    negligent misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     There will be judgment for the plaintiff
                    against the first defendant in the sum of $300,000, interest thereon at the
                    court rate from 2 August 2009 to date of payment and costs. The
                    plaintiff’s claim against the second defendant is dismissed with
                    costs.</p>
