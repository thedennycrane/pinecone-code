<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff was 47 years old and the defendant
                    was 58 years old when they were married on 11 October 1995. This was the
                    defendant’s second marriage and the plaintiff’s first. The
                    defendant’s first wife passed away from cancer on 27 May 1994. The
                    defendant has three sons from his first marriage. During their marriage, the
                    plaintiff and the defendant resided at No 2 Li Hwan Close, Singapore 557126
                    which was their matrimonial home. The matrimonial home was a gift from the
                    defendant’s father and was where the defendant had been staying since 1974
                    when he married his first wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant averred in his Defence and
                    Counterclaim that he and the plaintiff had lived separate lives since 2000.
                    There had been no communication between the parties and they had ceased having
                    conjugal relations since 2000. The divorce was uncontested and the parties had
                    obtained an interim judgment on 17 April 2009. The duration of their
                    marriage was about 13.5 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the hearing on 31 January 2011, the
                    plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Stuart Andrew Palmer
                    (“Mr Palmer”) confirmed that the plaintiff was not claiming
                    any share of the matrimonial property or the defendant’s assets. As there
                    was no child arising from this marriage, the only remaining ancillary matter
                    before me concerned the maintenance of the plaintiff. When the hearing resumed
                    on 26 April 2011, Mr Palmer repeated the plaintiff’s position
                    that she was not claiming any share of the matrimonial property or any of the
                    defendant’s assets and that she was content with
                maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff did not adduce any evidence of the
                    monthly maintenance which the defendant had allegedly provided to her during the
                    subsistence of the marriage. Instead, she pursued different amounts for her
                    maintenance which were not supported by any evidence. In her amended Statement
                    of Particulars (“Statement of Particulars (Amendment No 1)”) filed
                    on 27 February 2009, the plaintiff confirmed that the defendant has not
                    been giving her <em>any</em> maintenance. In spite of the
                    complete absence of any evidence to support her claim for monthly maintenance,
                    the defendant nevertheless offered a lump sum maintenance of $75,000 to the
                    plaintiff, payable in three monthly instalments, in order to achieve a clean
                    break with the plaintiff. Given that the defendant is already 74 years old
                    and has long since retired, I was of the view that this was a generous offer by
                    the defendant. Faced with this offer, Mr Palmer had nothing to add other
                    than to say that he had no instructions to accept or reject the offer. Under
                    these circumstances, I ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff a lump sum
                    maintenance of $75,000 payable in three monthly instalments subject to a
                    condition which I will elaborate below. At the hearing, I made it quite clear
                    that I would not have ordered the lump sum maintenance of $75,000 but for the
                    generous offer from the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As the plaintiff has since appealed against my
                    order, I now state my full grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s maintenance claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the course of her application, the
                    plaintiff’s stance on the maintenance paid by the defendant during the
                    marriage underwent several changes:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     In her original Statement of
                        Particulars filed on 1 August 2008 at paragraph 1(g), she initially
                        claimed that the defendant “has not been giving the Plaintiff any
                        monthly maintenance for the past five (5) to six (6) years. Prior to that,
                        the defendant use (<em>sic</em>) to give the Plaintiff
                        monthly maintenance of $800 to $1,000”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     In her Statement of Particulars (Amendment No 1),
                        the reference to the allegation that the defendant had provided the
                        plaintiff with monthly maintenance of $800 to $1,000 was deleted altogether
                        with the result that paragraph 1(g) read that “The Defendant has not
                        been giving the Plaintiff any monthly maintenance”. The effect of the
                        amendment was that the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had not been
                        giving her any maintenance at all throughout the
                    marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the
                        plaintiff’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 9 June 2009
                        (“plaintiff’s Affidavit of Assets and Means” or
                        “her Affidavit of Assets and Means” as the case may be), she,
                        however, alleged that the defendant had provided her with monthly
                        maintenance of about $1,000 (see paragraph 16 of the plaintiff’s
                        Affidavit of Assets and Means).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     At paragraph 21 of the plaintiff’s
                            3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit filed on 20 November 2009
                        (“plaintiff’s 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit”
                        or “her 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit” as the case
                        may be), the plaintiff alleged that the defendant used to pay her monthly
                        maintenance of $800 to $1,000 even after she stopped
                    working.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     At the
                        hearing on 31 January 2011, Mr Palmer submitted that the plaintiff
                        was claiming for either a monthly maintenance of $6,000 or alternatively, a
                        lump sum maintenance of about $290,000. Notwithstanding the affidavit
                        evidence of the plaintiff, Mr Palmer submitted that the defendant had
                        been giving the plaintiff monthly maintenance of $1,800 from 1995 to July
                        2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_f"></a>(f)     At the
                        resumption of the hearing on 26 April 2011, Mr Palmer repeated the
                        plaintiff’s claim for a lump sum maintenance of $292,000 which was the
                        product of a monthly sum of $1,800 and a multiplicand of 13.5 (<em>ie</em>, the length of the
                marriage).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       From the above summary, it is clear that the
                    plaintiff’s case on the monthly maintenance which the defendant had
                    allegedly provided to her during the marriage changed from $800 to $1,000, to
                    $1,800, to nothing at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Having identified the moving target for the
                    plaintiff’s maintenance claim, it is necessary to examine the evidence
                    adduced by the plaintiff in support of her claim. At the hearing on
                    31 January 2011, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had paid her
                    monthly maintenance in the sum of $1,800 but when queried by the court,
                    Mr Palmer confirmed that the plaintiff did not have any evidence to support
                    the alleged maintenance payments by the defendant. Mr Palmer submitted that
                    the alleged maintenance payments were by way of cash which were left by the
                    defendant on a table in the matrimonial home. This was not stated in any of the
                    plaintiff’s affidavits. Owing to the complete lack of evidence,
                    Mr Palmer then requested for an adjournment to attempt an amicable
                    resolution to which the defendant readily agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the resumption of the hearing on
                    26 April 2011, the issue of the plaintiff’s maintenance,
                    unfortunately, remained unresolved. Mr Palmer repeated the
                    plaintiff’s claim for a lump sum maintenance of $292,000. It was conceded
                    by Mr Palmer that, other than the plaintiff’s mere assertion, there
                    was no evidence to substantiate any maintenance payment by the defendant during
                    the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     When further queried by the court as regards
                    the plaintiff’s position as evinced in paragraph 1(g) of the Statement of
                    Particulars (Amendment No. 1), where she admitted that she did not receive any
                    maintenance, Mr Palmer proffered an explanation that it was drafted in such
                    terms in order to achieve a consensual divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s position in respect of the plaintiff’s
                maintenance claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Originally the defendant’s position was
                    that no maintenance should be ordered for the plaintiff because the defendant
                    did not provide her with any during the marriage as both parties kept their
                    finances separate during the marriage. The defendant, however, submitted that if
                    maintenance was ordered by the court, it should be no more than
                        $21,160<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> on a lump sum basis. The explanation
                    provided by the defendant’s counsel, Mr Michael Moey
                    (“Mr Moey”), for this amount was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     At most, the defendant should only
                        be required to provide the plaintiff with maintenance to rent a room. The
                        defendant submitted that an average room rental in a Housing Development
                        Board (“HDB”) flat is about $575 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Given that the defendant has since retired, the decision
                        in <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em> [2000]
                        2 SLR(R) 659 where Prakash J at [97] held that “the wife
                        cannot expect to be maintained at the same standard after the husband
                        retires”, and that any maintenance should be halved after the
                        husband’s retirement, should be followed such that, in this case, the
                        maintenance should be half of the monthly room rental, <em>ie</em>, $287.50 which the defendant rounded up to $300 per
                        month.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Given
                        that the average life expectancy of an average Singaporean male was about 79
                        years, the appropriate multiplicand should, at best, be seven years since
                        the defendant was already 72 years old when the application was first
                        filed by the plaintiff. This would translate to a sum of $25,200
                        ($300x12x7). The defendant suggested a 20% discount for lump sum payment
                        which works out to be $20,160 and not $21,160 as submitted by
                        Mr Moey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the resumption of the hearing on
                    26 April 2011, Mr Moey informed the court that the defendant was
                    prepared to offer a lump sum maintenance of $75,000 payable in three monthly
                    instalments provided the plaintiff transferred a property in Hainan registered
                    in the plaintiff’s name (“the Hainan Property”) back to the
                    defendant. The defendant’s offer was more than three times his original
                    submission to the court in the event that maintenance was ordered. It clearly
                    demonstrated a keen desire on the part of the defendant to bring closure to this
                    chapter of his life. Unfortunately, this desire was not reciprocated by the
                    plaintiff who insisted on maintaining her original claim of $292,000 in spite of
                    her complete lack of evidence. I should add for completeness that in the
                    defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 11 June 2009
                    (“defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means” or “his
                    Affidavit of Assets and Means” as the case may be) (at paragraph 19), he
                    was initially prepared to allow the plaintiff to retain the Hainan Property
                    without any maintenance as he had not given any to the plaintiff during the
                    marriage. The defendant’s offer of the lump sum maintenance payment of
                    $75,000 on condition that the plaintiff transferred the Hainan Property back to
                    him was therefore a new and improved proposal altogether and was different from
                    his earlier position as set out in his Affidavit of Assets and
                Means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Although the defendant’s offer was made
                    subject to a condition, it was of no real consequence to the plaintiff. First,
                    there was no dispute that the Hainan Property was paid for entirely by the
                    defendant. Secondly, Mr Palmer also accepted during the hearing on
                    26 April 2011 that the registration of the Hainan Property in the
                    plaintiff’s name was not intended as a gift to her. Thirdly, the plaintiff
                    in her 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit filed on 26 August 2009
                    (“Plaintiff’s 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit” or
                    “her 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit” as the case may be)
                    at paragraph 9 stated that the Hainan Property was of no value. Finally,
                    Mr Palmer also confirmed that the plaintiff was not seeking any share of
                    the defendant’s assets or a division of the matrimonial assets and that
                    all of his assets were acquired prior to the marriage. Accordingly, the
                    condition which was attached to the defendant’s offer was no more than a
                    means to ensure that the plaintiff took the necessary steps to transfer the
                    Hainan Property back to him.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In assessing maintenance, the court shall
                    endeavour to place the parties so far as it is practicable and, having regard to

                    her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other. As Lai Kew
                    Chai J aptly observed in <em>Quek Lee Tiam (mw) v Ho Kim
                        Swee (alias Ho Kian Guan)</em> [1995] SGHC 23
                        (“<em>Quek Lee Tiam</em>”) at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> (albeit in the context of s 108(2) of
                    the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Ed) [which is the predecessor
                    of s 114(2) of the Women’s Charter]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of its statutory context, the principle is confined to the
                        preservation of her financial position in terms of her maintenance. She
                        should therefore be financially provided so that she can continue to live at
                        a level as she did immediately before the breakdown of the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In this factual inquiry, it is relevant to
                    examine the level of maintenance which was provided by the defendant to the
                    plaintiff during the marriage. In this regard, the plaintiff’s evidence
                    has been far from satisfactory. In the Statement of Particulars (Amendment No
                    1), the plaintiff, at paragraph 1(g), stated that the defendant had not been
                    giving her any monthly maintenance. The plaintiff, however, alleged in her
                        3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit that the defendant had provided her
                    with monthly maintenance of between $800 to $1,000 without any supporting
                    evidence. This led Mr Palmer to submit that the alleged monthly maintenance
                    was paid by the defendant by placing the cash on a table in the matrimonial
                    home. Next, there was a contradiction in the plaintiff’s affidavits as to
                    when the defendant stopped providing her with monthly maintenance. The
                    plaintiff, in her 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit at paragraph 21,
                    stated that the defendant stopped giving her maintenance in 2004. However, in
                    the plaintiff’s affidavit filed on 9 June 2010 (at paragraph 7), she
                    alleged that the defendant had stopped giving her any maintenance since
                    3 July 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant, in his Defence and Counterclaim
                    (at paragraph 2(h)), admitted that he had not given any regular monthly
                    maintenance to the plaintiff from the inception of the marriage. He did, on
                    occasion, give the plaintiff about $200 to $250. There was, however, no pattern
                    to this. The defendant’s explanation was that this was because he had
                    since retired and the plaintiff was still working. He reiterated that both
                    parties had supported themselves independently. He denied giving the plaintiff
                    monthly maintenance of $1,000 (see the defendant’s
                        2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit filed on 15 July 2009
                    (“defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit”
                    or “his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit” as the case may
                    be) at paragraph 22).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Financial arrangement of the parties during the marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is pertinent to highlight, at this
                    juncture, that the defendant reached retirement age a year after their marriage
                    in 1995. The defendant in his Affidavit of Assets and Means at paragraph 32
                    stated that during the duration of the marriage when the plaintiff was still
                    working, she kept all the money she earned for herself and did not contribute to
                    the household, either directly or indirectly. This is entirely consistent with
                    the plaintiff’s own admission at paragraph 1(f) of her Statement of
                    Particulars, that from the outset of the marriage, both parties had kept
                    “their finances distinct and separate from one
                another”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The financial arrangement between the
                    plaintiff and the defendant during the course of the marriage was also not a
                    typical one. Most couples would have a common fund, usually in the form of joint
                    bank accounts, for the purposes of covering general household expenses. Although
                    there was an OCBC account which was opened in the joint names of the plaintiff
                    and the defendant, the defendant, in his 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    affidavit at paragraph 4, stated that he had no access to the account as he did
                    not have the account passbook. Furthermore, the absence of a common fund to pay
                    for household expenses can also be attributed to the fact that at the time of
                    the marriage, the defendant’s three sons were already grown up. They were
                    28, 26 and 24 years old respectively and there was no question of the plaintiff
                    looking after them (see the defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    affidavit at paragraph 12).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Earning capacity and monthly expenses of the respective
                parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Prior to the plaintiff’s marriage to the
                    defendant, the plaintiff was carrying out accounting work and earned a monthly
                    income of about $2,550. After the plaintiff married the defendant, she claimed
                    at paragraph 19 of her Affidavit of Assets and Means that she “hardly
                    continued with [her] accounting work as [she] became a housewife”. In the
                    later part of the marriage, she claimed that she started working part time as
                    the defendant did not give her regular maintenance. The plaintiff is currently
                    self-employed and works as a freelance accountant/book keeper with a monthly
                    income of $800 and a further monthly sum of about $300 from her involvement in
                    multi-level marketing (paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit of
                    Assets and Means).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Although the plaintiff claimed to have monthly
                    expenses of about $6,344.50 (as per paragraph 29 of her
                        2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit), by her own case, the defendant
                    had at most provided her with maintenance of between $800 to $1,000. The
                    plaintiff failed to produce any evidence to support her claim or to explain how
                    she was able to bridge the difference over their 13.5 years of
                marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendant is now 74 years old and has
                    since retired. He enjoys a monthly income of $2,150 which represents his share
                    of rental from a shop in Far East Plaza which he had inherited with his
                    siblings. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    The defendant’s monthly expenses are about $2,600. The difference between
                    his monthly expenses and his monthly income is made up from the monthly
                    allowances which he receives from his children. Although the defendant has other
                    properties, they are either encumbered (in respect of the property which is
                    situated along Oxley Road) or disputed (due to a disputed inheritance claim to a
                    share of sale proceeds of 145 Killiney Road). As the defendant has retired, he
                    does not have other financial resources. The defendant has an outstanding loan
                    of $204,386 (as at 6 May 2009) secured by a mortgage over the matrimonial
                    home and a personal loan of $200,000 which is owed to his sister (see paragraph
                    15 of his Affidavit of Assets and Means).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance for rental</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I was of the view that given the lack of any
                    evidence to prove the provision of any maintenance to the plaintiff, which was
                    consistent with the plaintiff’s own assertion that no maintenance was
                    provided by the defendant during the marriage and that both parties kept their
                    finances separate from each other throughout the marriage, the only amount which
                    I was minded to award her was a monthly allowance for rental of a room. The loss
                    of accommodation was the only “loss” suffered by the plaintiff
                    following the dissolution of the marriage. In this regard, it should be pointed
                    out that prior to the marriage, the plaintiff was staying with her nephew. The
                    plaintiff drew the court’s attention to the fact that the nephew’s
                    current property was only purchased in 2008 and therefore, contrary to the
                    defendant’s assertion, she could not have been staying with her nephew at
                    his current address prior to the marriage. However, the defendant merely stated
                    at paragraph 24 of his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit that the
                    plaintiff was staying with the nephew prior to the marriage without specifying
                    any address. When the plaintiff left the matrimonial home in 2008, she returned
                    to stay with her nephew which remains the position to-date. Although there is no
                    evidence of any payment of rental by the plaintiff to her nephew, she claimed a
                    monthly rental of $1,500. There was also no suggestion in any of the
                    plaintiff’s affidavits that the nephew was not prepared to allow her to
                    continue to stay with him. After all, by returning to stay with her nephew, the
                    plaintiff was effectively reverting to <em>status quo</em>,
                    as far as her living arrangement was concerned, prior to the
                marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Nonetheless, I was prepared to award her an
                    allowance for renting a room since it was unclear to me whether she would be
                    permitted to stay at her nephew’s place indefinitely. In doing so, I was
                    in fact giving the plaintiff the benefit of any doubt as to whether she would be
                    able to stay with the nephew indefinitely even though there was no assertion to
                    the contrary. I accepted the amount of about $575 per month for rental of a room
                    was a reasonable figure. In fact, Mr Palmer accepted during the hearing on
                    26 April 2011 that the monthly rental for a room in a HDB flat would range
                    between $600 to $650. Further, no submission was made by Mr Palmer that a
                    rented HDB room was not suitable accommodation for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In determining the appropriate quantum of
                    maintenance to be paid to the plaintiff, Mr Palmer accepted, at the hearing
                    on 26 April 2011, that the multiplicand should not be measured in terms of
                    the length of the marriage. Instead, he accepted that it should be based on
                    factors such as the defendant’s age and his income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I found that the plaintiff’s monthly
                    maintenance claim of $1,800 over 13.5 years was plainly excessive. Based on the
                    evidence before me, it was clear to me that the plaintiff had been financially
                    independent even prior to the marriage and also prior to the breakdown of the
                    marriage. There was no evidence that she had been receiving any maintenance from
                    the defendant. Further, this was entirely consistent with the plaintiff’s
                    own assertion that both parties kept their finances separate and distinct during
                    the marriage. Under these circumstances, I found the defendant’s offer of
                    $75,000 to be generous. The defendant is already 74 years old (he was 72 years
                    old at the time when the application was first filed) and his age is relevant in
                    determining the number of years which the court would require him to maintain
                    the plaintiff. Given that the life expectancy of an average Singaporean male is
                    about 79 years, <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> I agreed with Mr Moey that a multiplier of
                    seven would be very fair. Accordingly, if it were left to me, I would have
                    ordered a lump sum maintenance of no more than $48,300 ($575x12x7) even without
                    factoring any discount for lump sum payment. Typically, a discount would be
                    applied for lump sum payment. Viewed in this context, the defendant’s lump
                    sum offer of $75,000 was indeed more than fair and reasonable to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As the plaintiff was not claiming any share of
                    the defendant’s assets including the Hainan Property, I ordered the
                    defendant to pay the plaintiff the lump sum maintenance of $75,000 in three
                    monthly instalments of $25,000 commencing within 14 days after the plaintiff
                    transfers the Hainan property back to the defendant. After all, according to the
