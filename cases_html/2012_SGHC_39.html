<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This matter commenced by way of a criminal
                    motion (<em>viz</em> Criminal Motion
                    No 81 of 2011), brought by Mathavakannan s/o Kalimuthu
                    (“the Applicant”) for the following orders or declarations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    that the decision by the Director of Prisons to
                            hold that the Applicant’s sentence of life imprisonment as
                            commuted by the President equates to the imprisonment for the
                            Applicant’s remaining natural life is contrary to the Honourable
                            Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in <em>Abdul Nasir
                                bin Amer </em><em>Hamsah v </em><em>Public Prosecutor</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 842
                            at 861;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    that the law applicable on 26 May 1996 (the
                            date of the Applicant’s offence) applies to the Presidential
                            clemency (to commute [the Applicant’s] death sentence to one of
                            life imprisonment) granted to the Applicant on 28 April 1998;
                            and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    that there may be such further or other relief as
                            may be deemed just in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The issue arising in this matter concerns the
                    interpretation of “life imprisonment” in the commutation order of
                    28 April 1998 made in exercise of the President’s commutation powers
                    under s 238 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“CPC”) (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>-<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent raised a preliminary objection to
                    the commencement of this action by way of a criminal motion. As the Applicant
                    agreed to converting it to an originating summons (“OS”), I do not
                    need to consider the merits of the mode of commencement. The Applicant made an
                    oral application before me for the proceedings to be heard by way of an OS
                    pursuant to O 5 r 14 read with O 15 r 16 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), with any documents to be
                    regularised accordingly and I granted it. This matter was thus thereafter
                    referred to as an OS, and the Applicant and Respondent were referred to as the
                    “Plaintiff” and “Defendant”
                respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Having read the submissions and heard the oral
                    arguments put forward by both sides, I declared that the President’s
                    commutation order for the Plaintiff to be “imprisoned for life”
                    referred to an imprisonment term of 20 years. I now render the grounds of my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Plaintiff, a Singaporean male currently 33
                    years of age, and two other accused persons were jointly charged for murder with
                    common intention for an act committed on 26 May 1996. The Plaintiff
                    was aged 18 years 16 days old at that time. On 27 November 1996, the
                    three were tried and convicted in the High Court and were sentenced to suffer
                    death (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Asogan </em><em>Ramesh </em><em>s/o Ramachandren &amp; 2
                        others</em> [1997] SGHC 181). The Court of Appeal dismissed
                    the appeal on 14 October 1997 (<em>Asogan
                        </em><em>Ramesh </em><em>s/o
                        Ramachandren and others v Public Prosecutor</em> [1997]
                    3 SLR(R) 201). Clemency petitions were thereafter filed by the three
                    convicted persons, but only the Plaintiff’s petition (filed on
                    13 January 1998) was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 28 April 1998, the President of the
                    Republic of Singapore Mr Ong Teng Cheong (“President Ong”)
                    commuted the Plaintiff’s sentence of death to a sentence of life
                    imprisonment. The commutation order was phrased as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">WHEREAS Mathavakannan K, having been tried at the High Court, Singapore,
                        was on the 27 November 1996, in due form of law convicted of and
                        sentenced to death for the commission of an offence of murder:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">AND WHEREAS I have, upon the advice of the Cabinet, decided in the
                        exercise of my prerogative that the said sentence of death passed upon him
                        be <em>commuted to a sentence of life
                        imprisonment</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">NOW, THEREFORE, I, ONG TENG CHEONG, President of the Republic of
                        Singapore, in exercise of the powers conferred on me by section 238 of the
                        Criminal Procedure Code, <em>do hereby commute the said
                            sentence of death and order that the said Mathavakannan K be imprisoned
                            for life</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">GIVEN under my Hand and the Seal at the Istana, Singapore, this 28th day
                        of April 1998.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 15 November 1999, the Singapore
                    Prison Service (“Prisons”) wrote to the Traffic Police telling the
                    officer-in-charge that the Plaintiff had been serving life imprisonment in
                    prison since 4 July 1996.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       President Ong’s term in office ended on
                    31 August 1999, and he passed away on 8 February
                2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 14 November 2002, Prisons wrote to
                    the Singapore Armed Forces stating, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that the Plaintiff’s tentative date of release was
                    28 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 13 September 2006 and
                    18 December 2006, two letters were written to Prisons requesting
                    clarification of the Plaintiff’s release date. On
                    28 December 2006, Prisons replied stating that President Ong had
                    commuted the Plaintiff’s death sentence to “natural life
                    imprisonment”. Counsel for the Plaintiff sought clarification from
                    Prisons via a letter on 4 January 2007, and Prisons said that more
                    time was required to look into the matter. On 5 March 2007, Prisons
                    replied to the Plaintiff, stating that upon clarification with the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”), the commutation of the
                    Plaintiff’s death sentence “by the President to life imprisonment
                    should be construed as life imprisonment for his remaining natural
                    life”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Plaintiff’s mother subsequently sent
                    a letter to the Minister for Law on 26 October 2010. Prisons responded
                    on 3 December 2010, stating <em>inter alia</em>
                    that the “commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment, effective
                    on 28 April 1998, by the President should be construed as life
                    imprisonment for his remaining natural life”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 28 March 2011, counsel for the
                    Plaintiff wrote in again to the AGC to restate the Plaintiff’s case. The
                    AGC replied on 28 July 2011, turning down the Plaintiff’s
                    request. The AGC further stated that the Plaintiff would be referred to the Life
                    Imprisonment Review Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the circumstances, the Plaintiff filed the
                    present criminal motion (now OS – see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above), seeking a determination that the Plaintiff’s
                    sentence, commuted by President Ong to life imprisonment, is in effect for 20
                    years, consistent with the pronouncement of the Court of Appeal in <em>Abdul Nasir bin Amer </em><em>Hamsah v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 842 (“<em>Abdul Nasir</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pronouncement in <em>Abdul
                Nasir</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Abdul Nasir</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal faced the issue of whether life imprisonment meant
                    imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner’s natural life. Although
                    s 45 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) defined
                    “life” as denoting the life of a human being, there was a practice
                    that life imprisonment meant 20 years’ imprisonment (see <em>Neo Man Lee v Public Prosecutor</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 918). Since 1954, Prisons had also regarded life imprisonment
                    as meaning a term of 20 years’ imprisonment with the possibility of
                    remission. It should also be pointed out that s 57 of the Penal Code at
                    that time provided that the term “imprisonment for life” is to be
                    construed as the equivalent to imprisonment for 20 years in calculating the
                    fractions of terms of punishment. In a landmark judgment considering the proper
                    interpretation of “life imprisonment”, the Court of Appeal held
                    that “life imprisonment” ought to be accorded its natural and
                    ordinary meaning, <em>viz</em> imprisonment for the
                    duration of the prisoner’s natural life (<em>Abdul
                        Nasir</em> at [70]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     However, the Court of Appeal was mindful of
                    Art 11 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Singapore Constitution”) which provided that no person shall
                    suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time
                    it was committed (<em>Abdul Nasir</em> at [49]). As
                    such, the Court of Appeal emphasised the need to protect the legitimate
                    expectations of individuals who arranged their affairs according to the
                    expectation that “life imprisonment” would be interpreted as a
                    term of 20 years (<em>ibid</em> at [56]). The Court of
                    Appeal was careful to make its interpretation of life imprisonment <em>prospective</em>, in the following manner (<em>ibid</em> at [70]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the reasons set out above, we concluded that the expression
                        “life imprisonment” or “imprisonment for life”
                        must mean imprisonment for the remaining natural life of the prisoner,
                        unless the legislation has provided otherwise. This judicial pronouncement
                        by us now shall have prospective effect, thereby affecting <em>only those offences which carry a life sentence committed after
                            the date of delivery of this judgment. However, should the offence be
                            committed before the date of delivery of this judgment, the old practice
                            of 20 years imprisonment would continue to apply to these
                            offenders.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In this regard, it should be noted that the
                    judgment in <em>Abdul Nasir</em> was delivered on
                    20 August 1997 and the date of the offence committed by the Plaintiff
                    was 26 May 1996.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Counsel for the Plaintiff raised four points
                    in support of his contention that the Plaintiff’s commuted sentence of
                    life imprisonment should be interpreted as a term of 20 years’
                    imprisonment, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, he argued that it was clear
                        from <em>Abdul Nasir</em> that for offences committed
                        before the date of the judgment in <em>Abdul
                        Nasir</em>, <em>ie</em> 20 August 1997, life
                        imprisonment was consistently given the technical meaning of 20 years’
                        imprisonment with the possibility of remission, and that the legitimate and
                        reasonable expectations of the offender should be given due consideration
                        when determining if the prospective approach should be applied. In this
                        case, the Plaintiff’s offence was committed before the date of the
                        judgment in <em>Abdul Nasir</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, he pointed out that on
                        14 November 2002, Prisons stated that the Plaintiff’s
                        “tentative date of release is 28 August
                            2011”.<sup></sup>Prisons could only have stated this if it was of the opinion
                        that life imprisonment meant 20 years’ imprisonment and was subject to
                        remission; that means that when Prisons applied its mind to President
                        Ong’s commutation order, it formed the view that life imprisonment
                        meant 20 years with remission. This led the Plaintiff to believe for a
                        period of almost eight years that he only had to serve 20 years’
                        imprisonment with remission.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the AGC advises the Cabinet, which in turn advises
                        the President to sign a clemency order. It was inconceivable that the AGC,
                        which would have known about the decision in <em>Abdul
                            Nasir</em>, would advise the Cabinet that President Ong could
                        ignore <em>Abdul Nasir</em>’s ruling and apply
                        the natural life interpretation retrospectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the Plaintiff had developed
                        the impression that he was facing a 20-year imprisonment term with the
                        prospects of remission should his behaviour remain good. According to
                        counsel for the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff had the legitimate belief that life
                        imprisonment meant 20 years, as bolstered by the various pronouncements by
                        Prisons and the explicit words of the Court of Appeal that <em>Abdul Nasir</em> had no retrospective
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Defendant took the position that it was
                    inconclusive whether the Plaintiff’s commuted sentence of life
                    imprisonment should be interpreted as a term of 20 years’ imprisonment,
                    for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, it was possible that the
                        Court of Appeal’s prospective pronouncement in <em>Abdul Nasir</em> was not meant to apply to offences that carried
                        the death penalty. Although the Court of Appeal initially remarked broadly
                        that its decision would “affect only offences committed <em>after</em> the pronouncement” [emphasis in
                        original] (<em>Abdul Nasir</em> at [66]), it
                        subsequently stated that its judicial pronouncement shall affect
                        “only those <em>offences which carry a life
                            sentence</em> committed after the date of delivery of this
                        judgment” [emphasis added] (<em>ibid</em>
                        at [70]). The Defendant submitted that the Court of Appeal’s
                        intention from the plain and ordinary words could have been deliberate: it
                        limited the impact of its pronouncement to the <em>class of
                            offences</em> stated, <em>viz</em> offences
                        which carried a life sentence. In the present case, the Plaintiff was
                        charged with and convicted of murder with common intention, an offence that
                        carried a mandatory death penalty by virtue of s 302 of the Penal Code.
                        Accordingly, it was not an offence intended to come within the scope of the
                        pronouncement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, it was possible that the Court of Appeal’s prospective
                        pronouncement was not meant to apply to commuted life sentences by the
                        President. This argument was premised on the fact that in <em>Yong Vui Kong v Attorney-General</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1189
                            (“<em>Yong Vui Kong</em>”)
                        at [74], the Court of Appeal remarked that the clemency power was a
                        legal power of an extraordinary character, being an act of executive grace
                        and not a legal right. In this regard, the interpretation of a life
                        imprisonment sentence may not only be dependent on the date in which the
                        offence was committed, but also on how the life imprisonment sentence was
                        arrived at. Given the extraordinary character of the clemency power, the
                        interpretation ascribed to commuted life imprisonment sentences is arguably
                            <em>sui </em><em>generis</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the arguments were equally weighed on the issue of whether the
                        Plaintiff could have had any legitimate expectations of his sentence being
                        construed as being an imprisonment term of 20 years since President Ong
                        commuted his sentence after the decision in <em>Abdul
                            Nasir</em>, because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       Any claim to a legitimate
                            expectation must be viewed against the background of the law as it stood
                            at the date of the clemency petition. The clemency petition was filed on
                            13 January 1998, and therefore the relevant law was
                            imprisonment for one’s natural life as decided in <em>Abdul Nasir</em>. In this regard, the Defendant
                            pointed out that a legitimate expectation could only arise on the basis
                            of a lawful promise or practice (see <em>Regina v
                                Secretary of State for Education and Employment</em>,
                                <em>Ex parte </em><em>Begbie</em> [2000] 1 WLR 1115 at 1125;
                                <em>Rowland v Environment Agency</em>
                            [2003] Ch 581 at [69], as approved by the English Court
                            of Appeal in [2005] Ch 1 at [67]). Accordingly, the
                            letter dated 14 November 2002 by Prisons to the Singapore
                            Armed Forces did not create any legitimate expectations, as it would
                            have been <em>ultra vires</em> for Prisons to make
                            that representation in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       It will also be erroneous to say that
                            any claim to legitimate expectation in respect of a commuted sentence is
                            to be viewed from the date the Plaintiff committed the offence, as there
                            is no legal right to clemency.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       However, the Defendant acknowledged that
                            legitimate expectations could have arisen from the prospective
                            pronouncement in <em>Abdul Nasir</em> – that
                            once clemency was granted, and once the commuted sentence had been
                            pronounced, there might have been legitimate expectations on what life
                            imprisonment meant <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                            prospective pronouncement in <em>Abdul Nasir</em>,
                                <em>viz</em> that life imprisonment sentences
                            were to be construed as 20 years’ imprisonment if the date of the
                            offence was before the delivery of the
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     President Ong had commuted the
                    Plaintiff’s sentence under s 238 of the CPC, which reads as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The basis for s 238 of the CPC was
                    s 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act (Act 9 of 1965,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“RSIA”). For the avoidance of doubt, s 8
                    of the RSIA was subsequently incorporated verbatim into the 1999 Reprint of the
                    Singapore Constitution as Art 22P (see <em>Yong Vui
                        Kong</em> at [26] and
                    [171], as well as <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em> vol 1 (LexisNexis, 2008 Reissue) at
                    para 10.843 n 1). However, as Art 22P of the Singapore
                    Constitution only came into effect on 1 July 1999, at the time of
                    making the commutation order in this case (<em>viz</em>
                    28 April 1998), President Ong was exercising power granted by
                    s 238 of the CPC read with s 8 of the RSIA. Section 8 of the RSIA

                            so that the Cabinet may advise the President on the exercise of the
                            power conferred on him by subsection (1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is clear from s 8(1)(b) of the RSIA
                    that the power of clemency is untrammelled. The President, acting on the advice
                    of the Cabinet, may, in the exercise of power under s 8 of the RSIA, grant
                    a “pardon, free or subject to lawful conditions”, or “any
                    reprieve or respite, either indefinite or for such period as the President may
                    think fit”. This meant that the President was empowered to commute a
                    capital sentence to, <em>inter alia</em>, an imprisonment
                    term of <em>any</em> period. The President was not bound,
                    when commuting a capital sentence, to impose “life imprisonment”
                    in accordance with how that term was understood under the law at the time of the
                    commutation; indeed, it was clearly open to the President to commute a capital
                    sentence to a sentence <em>lower</em> than “life
                    imprisonment” (regardless of whether it meant “natural
                    life” or “20 years”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The question that arose for determination by
                    this court was therefore the following: What did President Ong, acting on the
                    advice of the Cabinet, intend when commuting the sentence of death imposed on
                    the Plaintiff to an order that the Plaintiff be “imprisoned for
                    life”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It should be noted from the outset that the
                    present OS <em>did not</em> require this court to question
                    the merits of President Ong’s commutation decision; instead, all that was
                    required was this court’s <em>interpretation</em> of
                    President Ong’s commutation order. Such interpretation of executive orders
                    is within the province of this court. While not dealing directly with the
                    interpretation of executive orders, support for the proposition just made may be
                    found in the principles enunciated in <em>Council of Civil
                        Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service</em>
                    [1985] AC 374 (“<em>GCHQ</em>”),
                        <em>Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs and others and
                        other appeals</em> [1988] 2 SLR(R) 525 (“<em>Chng Suan Tze</em>”) and <em>Yong Vui
                        Kong</em>. In both <em>GCHQ</em> and <em>Chng Suan Tze</em>, the UK House of Lords and the Singapore
                    Court of Appeal respectively held that while the executive was the sole judge of
                    what action was necessary in the interests of national security, the courts were
                    nonetheless empowered to determine whether a particular executive decision was
                    in fact based on grounds of national security. Based on the same principles, the
                    Court of Appeal recently held in <em>Yong Vui Kong</em>
                    that while the merits of a clemency decision generally fall outside the purview
                    of courts, the procedural safeguards <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    exercise of clemency power were amenable to judicial review (<em>Yong Vui Kong</em> at [75]-[85]). Indeed, reasoning from the
                    decision in <em>Yong Vui Kong</em>, it may be said that the
                    logically prior step before a court is able to judicially review whether the
                    requisite procedural safeguards have been complied with <em>vis-à-vis</em> the exercise of clemency power will probably involve
                    an interpretation of the clemency order itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the present case, President Ong could have
                    meant one of two things when commuting the capital sentence to an order for the
                    Plaintiff to be “imprisoned for life”, <em>viz</em> either (a) that the Plaintiff would suffer imprisonment
                    for 20 years under the pre-<em>Abdul Nasir</em> regime
                    given, <em>inter alia</em>, that the offence was committed
                        <em>before</em> the date of the <em>Abdul Nasir</em> judgment; or (b) that the Plaintiff would
                    suffer imprisonment for the rest of his natural life under the <em>Abdul Nasir</em> regime given, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the commutation took place <em>after</em> the <em>Abdul Nasir</em>
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     There is therefore an ambiguity over what
                    exactly President Ong meant when he ordered that the Plaintiff be
                    “imprisoned for life”. Against the backdrop of such ambiguity, it
                    was necessary for me to decide which of the two interpretations President Ong
                    had intended. I should point out that the Defendant did not produce any evidence
                    as to what President Ong had meant by the term “life imprisonment”
                    when he made the commutation order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As is evident from <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>-<a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above, the
                    arguments supporting each of the two interpretations were finely balanced. This
                    was acknowledged by the parties, and in particular, the Defendant. In my view,
                    due to the significant change in the law as of the date of the <em>Abdul Nasir</em> decision, and the fact that it was unclear
                    whether <em>Abdul Nasir</em> applied to a case such as the
                    present, it is inconceivable that the legal advisors to President Ong and the
                    Cabinet would not have recommended expressing the commutation order in clearer
                    terms if it was intended for the Plaintiff to be imprisoned for the rest of his
                    natural life. This was especially so given that the long established practice of
                    interpreting “life imprisonment” as an imprisonment term of 20
                    years (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above) was only changed
                    eight months prior to President Ong’s commutation order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Furthermore, any interpretation of President
                    Ong’s commutation order ought also to be guided by the principle of strict
                    construction, <em>viz</em> that penal statutes are to be
                    strictly construed to lean in the accused’s favour (<em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183
                        (“<em>Low Kok Heng</em>”) at [31],
                    citing <em>Tuck &amp; Sons v Priester</em> (1887) 19 QBD
                    629). The historical origins of this principle lay in English capital cases,
                    where the construction of an ambiguous law <em>in favorem
                        vitae</em> was regarded as a form of fairness to the individual
                        (<em>Low Kok Heng</em> at [32]). It is clear that the
                    principle of strict construction still exists in Singapore law today (<em>ibid</em> at [35]). I see no reason why this principle
                    should not apply in the circumstances of the present case. Indeed, the
                    construction of President Ong’s commutation order <em>in
                        favorem vitae</em> would – in line with the rationale for the
                    principle of strict construction – constitute a form of fairness to the
                    individual, especially in a case such as the present where there are serious
                    implications on the Plaintiff’s liberty depending on the particular
                    interpretation taken and that he had, at least since 2002, been given indication
                    that his capital sentence had in effect been commuted to 20 years’
                    imprisonment (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     For the reasons given above, I held that the
                    proper interpretation of President Ong’s order for the Plaintiff to be
                    “imprisoned for life” was that it was to be for a term of
                    imprisonment of 20 years.</p>
