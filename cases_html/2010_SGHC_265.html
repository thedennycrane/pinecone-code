        Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Subiaco (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“Subiaco”), is the owner of the Singapore registered vessel
                        <em>Achilles</em>. The <em>Achilles</em> is a ‘tweendecker built in 1984. By a
                    “Conlinebooking” Liner Booking Note (1978 standard form) dated
                    21 January 2008 (“the Booking Note”), the defendant agreed to
                    book space on board the <em>Achilles</em> to carry 3000 mt
                    of barite in bags (“the cargo”) from Haiphong, Vietnam, to two
                    discharge ports in Australia. The main issue in this action revolves around the
                    term on which freight was booked, <em>viz</em>,
                    “free in stowed l/s/d/liner out hook”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant, Baker Hughes Singapore Pte, is an
                    unlimited company incorporated in Singapore and trades under the name of Baker
                    Hughes Inteq (hereafter referred to as “BHS” or “the
                    defendant”). BHS is part of the worldwide group of Baker Hughes
                    companies. Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids (“BHDF”) is an operating
                    division in the Baker Hughes group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> BHDF is the
                    division whose name appears on the shipping documentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       By way of two purchase orders dated
                    24 December 2007, the BHDF office in Aberdeen, UK (“BHDF
                    Aberdeen”), purchased from VCM Mineral &amp; Chemical Co Ltd
                    (“VCM”), a company in Vietnam, a consignment of 3000 mt of barite
                    in bags of 1.5 mt each (“the cargo”) on FOB Incoterms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The cargo was to be shipped
                    from Haiphong to Darwin and Dampier in Australia. In this connection, the
                    Booking Note for the shipment and carriage of the cargo of barite from Haiphong
                    to two named discharge ports in Australia was issued to “BHDF” in
                    Singapore as Merchant. The negotiations for the booking of space on board the
                        <em>Achilles</em> were carried out on behalf of Subiaco
                    by Mocean Shipping Pte Ltd (“Mocean”). The persons concerned, in
                    so far as it may be relevant, on behalf of Mocean was a Mr Andres Henrik
                    Hansen (“Henrik”), and on behalf of BHS, a Mr Ong Chwee Kok,
                    also known as Patrick Ong (“Patrick”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the present action, the negotiations between
                    Henrik and Patrick were conducted orally, before the latter received a signed
                    copy of the Booking Note containing the terms and conditions of the booking. Box
                    10 of the Booking Note is the freight clause. The term “free in
                    stowed” followed by the letters “l/s/d” (which stand for
                    lashed, secured and dunnaged) were added to the printed form
                    “freight” clause in Box 10 of the Booking Note. The freight
                    rate in Box 10 is thus described as “USD 100.00 per revenue tonne free in
                    stowed, l/s/d/ liner out hook”. The phrase “liner out hook”
                    relates to discharging operations, and is not relevant for present purposes, and
                    henceforth is not referred to in this Judgment. Box 12 named VMC as the
                    Merchant’s representative at the loading port. Boxes 11 and 13 provided
                    that BHS had three weather working days “SHINC” (Sundays Holidays
                    included) to load the cargo failing which demurrage was payable at the rate of
                    US$ 7,500 per day pro rata.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Booking Note further provided, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.   Definition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the term “Merchant” is used in this Bill of Lading, it
                        shall be deemed to include the Shipper, the Receiver, the Consignee, the
                        Holder of the Bill of Lading and the Owner of the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.   Period of responsibility</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Carrier or his Agent shall not be liable for loss of or damage to the
                        goods during the period before loading and after discharge from the vessel,
                        however such loss or damage arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.   Loading, Discharging and Delivery</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of the cargo shall be arranged by the Carrier’s Agent unless
                        otherwise agreed. … The Merchant or his Assigns shall tender the
                        goods when the vessel is ready to load and as fast as the vessel can receive
                        and – but only if required by the Carrier- also outside ordinary
                        working hours notwithstanding any custom of the port. Otherwise the Carrier
                        shall be relieved of any obligation to load such cargo and the vessel may
                        leave the port without further notice and deadfreight is to be paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Booking Note also contained a superseding
                    clause, and it provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is hereby agreed that this Contract shall be performed subject to the
                        terms contained on Page 1 and 2 hereof which shall prevail over any previous
                        arrangements and which shall in turn be superseded (except as to deadfreight
                        and demurrage) by the terms of the Bill of Lading, the terms of which (in
                        full or in extract) are found on the reverse side thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The loading of the cargo at Haiphong on
                    1 February 2008 was carried out by stevedores from the Hoang Dieu
                    Stevedoring Company (“Hoang Dieu”). Hoang Dieu is the only
                    stevedoring company handling cargo operations in the Haiphong port. It is not
                    disputed that No 2 deck crane (“the crane”) and the starboard
                    bridge wing of the <em>Achilles</em> sustained damage
                    during loading operations. Loading of the cargo resumed after the incident on
                    1 February 2008. After completion of loading at Haiphong, Mocean on behalf
                    of the carrier, Subiaco, issued two liner bills (in conline 1978 standard form),
                    both dated 2 February 2008, for the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The printed terms of the liner bills of lading
                    are identical to those stated on page 1 of the Booking Note. Apart from that,
                    BHDF Aberdeen was the named shipper, and BHDF Perth (BHDF’s office in
                    Perth) was the named consignee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The liner bills of lading were
                    marked “FREIGHT PREPAID”, and there was no incorporation of the
                    matters appearing on page 2 of the Booking Note including the term
                    “free in stowed, l/s/d” in Box 10 of the Booking Note (hereinafter
                    referred to as the “f.i.s. l/s/d term”). The Mate’s Receipt
                    named VMC as the shipper and not as the Merchant’s representative at the
                    loading port, contrary to Box 12 of the Booking Note.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In this action filed on 14 January 2009,
                    Subiaco claims against the defendant damages for breach of contract (<em>ie</em>, the Booking Note) in respect of the damage sustained
                    by the vessel and the crane on 1 February 2008 at Haiphong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The competing arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is convenient, at this juncture, to explain
                    the position adopted at the trial by BHS which, in my view, removed from the
                    fray any privity of contract issue. Counsel for BHS, Mr K Muralitherapany
                    (“Mr Murali”), accepts that the parties to the Booking Note
                    were BHS and Subiaco, but he reserved the defendant’s rights under the
                    superseding clause. However, in closing submissions, Mr Murali confirmed
                    the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Despite references to BHDF in the
                        Booking Note and relevant bills of lading, BHS accepts that, in the present
                        action, it is the contracting party as it had pleaded in para 4 of the
                        Defence (Amendment No 1).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The <em>Achilles</em> and the crane
                        sustained damage. Whilst the nature of the damage was as reported by
                        Subiaco, BHS was not admitting that the damage was caused by the stevedore
                        during loading operations, and that the stevedore was negligent or
                        incompetent as alleged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As regards, the defendant’s
                    concession, Subiaco accepts that the Booking Note contract was with BHS, and
                    rejects the position adopted by BHS in so far as the liner bills of lading are
                    concerned. In the final analysis, the conflicting positions, in my view, are not
                    material, and nothing significant turns on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subiaco’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Subiaco claims that during cargo loading
                    operations on 1 February 2008, a stevedore from Hoang Dieu operated the
                    vessel’s crane without the permission and/or authority of the
                    vessel’s crew, and in a negligent manner caused the crane jib to hit
                    against the underside of the starboard bridge wing of the vessel, thereby
                    resulting in damage to the crane and the vessel. Subiaco argues that BHS is
                    liable for the act or neglect of the stevedore because the loading operations at
                    the load port were expressly agreed to be at the defendant’s own risk and
                    expense. In support of its contention, Subiaco relies on the Booking Note and,
                    in particular, the f.i.s. l/s/d term in Box 10 of the Booking Note. Read in the
                    context of the factual matrix described below, counsel for Subiaco,
                    Mr Jainil Bhandari (“Mr Bhandari”), submits that the
                    phrase “free in, stowed l/s/d” is to be understood to, <em>inter alia</em>, mean that the defendant at its own risk and
                    expense would (whether by itself, or its representatives at the load port) load,
                    stow, secure, lash and dunnage the cargo at load port, and/or engage/appoint
                    stevedores necessary for the cargo operations as described.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Furthermore, the agreement to load cargo at
                    the defendant’s own risk and expense was also based on:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the conduct of the defendant,
                        whereby the defendant appointed agents and/or representatives at the load
                        port, namely VMC, to carry out the cargo operations, and those operations
                        were carried out by stevedores appointed by VMC from Hoang Dieu;
                        and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     an
                        established course of dealings between the parties since around June 2007,
                        whereby Subiaco had previously shipped bagged barites for the defendant from
                        Haiphong to Dampier and Darwin on “free in, stowed” terms, and
                        the usual and/or customary procedure adopted by the parties was for the
                        defendant to carry out the cargo operations through stevedores appointed by
                        its agents or representatives at the load port.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was contended that the defendant, being
                    responsible for cargo operations, was obliged to carry them out properly and/or
                    carefully through the stevedoring company appointed by VMC as agents for and on
                    behalf of the defendant. In breach of contract, an employee of the stevedoring
                    company, who was under the care and responsibility of the defendant, negligently
                    damaged the vessel and the crane during loading operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Alternatively, if Subiaco was responsible for
                    loading the cargo, the fallback argument is that the defendant had agreed to
                    appoint or arrange for the stevedores (through its representatives at the load
                    port), and it was an implied term of the contract evidenced by the Booking Note
                    that the defendant would appoint and/or nominate reasonably competent stevedores
                    to load stow and secure the cargo. In breach of this duty, the stevedore who
                    operated the crane was incompetent. The damage caused to the vessel and the
                    crane was due to the stevedore’s incompetence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendant rejects Subiaco’s
                    contentions. While the loading operations were free of cost to Subiaco, the
                    defendant did not agree, whether by Box 10 of the Booking Note, by conduct or
                    through a previous course of dealings, to carry out the loading operations at
                    its risk and expense. The defendant maintains that: (a) it did not appoint the
                    stevedoring company; and (b) it was not required and/or did not ask VMC to
                    appoint stevedores on its behalf. VMC appointed the stevedoring company for
                    itself as FOB seller of the cargo and/or as agents for Subiaco. Alternatively,
                    the defendant does not admit that (a) the crane was being operated by the
                    stevedore when the crane and the vessel were damaged; and (b) the damage was due
                    to the stevedore’s negligence or incompetence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The issues of liability and quantum have been
                    bifurcated following a consent order dated 2 October 2009. On the liability
                    issue, the arguments throw up one main area of dispute: was it Subiaco or BHS
                    who bore the contractual responsibility for loading the cargo and the risk of
                    cargo operations at load port? If the answer is that the loading was at the risk
                    (but not at the expense) of Subiaco, there is no need to deal with the
                    subsidiary defence relating to the alleged negligence of the stevedore including
                    the appointment of competent stevedores, and whether negligence and incompetence
                    have been proven.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The contractual question involves, <em>inter alia</em>, (a) the construction of the f.i.s. l/s/d
                    term in the Booking Note for its meaning and effect in the light of the printed
                    standard terms on page 1 of the Booking Note; and (b) whether, on the facts
                    and circumstances of the case, the f.i.s. l/s/d term has an extended meaning
                    argued for by Subiaco (hereinafter referred to as “the extended meaning
                    argument”). The extended meaning argument, in my view, correctly
                    characterises the real issue rather than the somewhat inaccurate plea founded on
                    an agreement by conduct or arising from a previous course of dealings.
                    Mr Bhandari has appreciated this inaccuracy, and, in his closing
                    submissions, has rightly distilled Subiaco’s pleaded case to essentially
                    the extended meaning argument. He states:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [Subiaco’s] case is that this term [f.i.s. l/s/d], when viewed
                            <u>in the context of the entire factual matrix in which
                            the parties were operating at the material time</u> (including
                        the other relevant terms of the Booking Note and the previous course of
                        dealings between the parties) meant that [BHS] had agreed to (whether by
                        [itself, or its] representatives at the loadport) load, stow and secure the
                        [cargo], and engage or appoint the stevedoring necessary for these
                        operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Consequently, it is submitted that as a <u>matter of
                            law</u>, [BHS is] responsible for the consequences of the
                        stevedore’s lack of care and skill in operating the [crane] in order
                        to perform the loading operations, and are therefore liable for the
                        damage.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The starting point is the common law rule
                    that, in the absence of express agreement, it is the shipowner’s
                    responsibility to load and stow the goods, at least as soon as the goods are on
                    board the vessel: Stewart C. Boyd <em>et al</em>, <em>Scrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2008) at pp 158-162 (“<em>Scrutton</em>”). Separately, the Booking Note is subject to
                    the Hague or Hague-Visby Rules (see the General Paramount
                    Clause (clause 2) in the Booking Note). By Article III r 2 of the
                    Hague or Hague-Visby Rules, the carrier is to properly and carefully load,
                    handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried. As the
                    House of Lords pointed out in <em>G H Renton &amp; Co Ltd v
                        Palmyra Trading Corporation of Panama</em> [1957] AC 149,
                    approving the dictum of Devlin J in <em>Pyrene Company Ltd v
                        Scindia Navigation Company Ltd</em> [1954] 2 QB 402
                        (“<em>Pyrene v Scindia</em>”), the
                    parties to the contract of carriage can by express agreement depart from or vary
                    their respective responsibilities, for example, the operation of loading under
                    Art III r 2. For convenience, the <em>Pyrene v
                        Scindia</em> reasoning (per Devlin J) is as follows (at
                    p 418):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The object of the Rules] is to define not the scope of the contract
                        service but the terms on which that service is to be performed. ... On this
                        view the whole contract of carriage is subject to the rules, but t<em>he extent to which loading and discharging are brought within
                            the carrier’s obligations is left to the parties themselves to
                            decide</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The authorities and textbooks on this topic
                    are unequivocal on the point: a departure from the common law position, and for
                    that matter, the responsibilities of loading and discharging under Art III
                    r 2, is a matter of express agreement. In short, it is founded on express
                    terms, and does not arise by implication of law or, by implication from the
                    booking note or charterparty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The first question, therefore, is whether the
                    f.i.s. l/s/d term <em>on its own</em> is clear enough to
                    transfer the risk of loading operations (not expense alone) from Subiaco to the
                    defendant. If the answer is no, are there appropriate term(s) in the Booking
                    Note to effectively transfer the risk of loading operations when read together
                    with the f.i.s. l/s/d term? The question of risk, however, has to be
                    distinguished from expense, meaning the costs of and associated with the loading
                    operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In this particular case, the freight rate was
                    booked “free in stowed, l/s/d/ liner out hook” (see Box 10), and
                    the loading and discharging under clause 8 was to be arranged by the
                    carrier’s agent unless otherwise agreed. Notably, the f.i.s. l/s/d term
                    appears in connection with the freight rate in Box 10, and that of its own does
                        <em>not</em> transfer the risk of loading from Subiaco
                    to the defendant. Box 10 of the Booking Note states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.   Freight rate (also indicate whether prepayable or
                        payable at destination)</p>

                        is perfectly possible to have a situation in which a carrier engages and
                        takes responsibility for stevedores but is reimbursed for the cost; or where
                        the shipper employs stevedores and takes responsibility for them, but is

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In <em>The Jordan II
                        (CA)</em>, the plaintiff’s steel coils were carried in the
                    defendant’s vessel from India to Spain. The cargo was shipped under two
                    bills of lading on the Congenbill form. The bills of lading incorporated the
                    terms and conditions of the Stemmor 1983 form voyage charterparty. The acronym
                    FIOST (“free in and out stowed and trimmed”) and the words
                    “lashed/secured/dunnaged” had been added to the printed form
                    freight clause (clause 3). Clause 17 of the charter provided
                    “Shippers/charterers/receivers to put the cargo on board, trim and
                    discharge cargo free of expense of the vessel.” After the cargo was
                    discharged, the plaintiff alleged that it had been damaged by defective loading,
                    stowage or discharge. The issue on appeal was whether the charter transferred
                    the obligation to load, stow and discharge from shipowners to charterers. The
                    English Court of Appeal held that the use of the word “free” in
                    clause 3 meant only at <em>no cost</em> to the
                    shipowner, and the fact that the charterers were to pay for the cargo operation
                    did not mean that they had also agreed to carry it out or be liable if it was
                    done badly. However, clause 17 (the second sentence of clause 17 on
                    the obligation to trim the cargo was found to be redundant and should have been
                    deleted because trimming was not required for a cargo of steel coils) should be
                    read together with clause 3 which was intended to relieve the defendant of
                    all responsibility for cargo operation; the parties’ intention was to
                    transfer the obligation to perform all cargo work to the charterer. Accordingly,
                    if all the cargo work had to be performed by charterers, they would be liable if
                    it was not properly or carefully carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal
                    held at [9] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was agreed that <em>at common law the obligation to
                            load, stow and discharge the cargo was on the shipowner</em> and
                        that <em>if this responsibility was to be transferred to the
                            charterer, clear words were required</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>The Jordan II
                        (CA)</em>, the responsibility was held to have transferred not because
                    of the term “FIOST” in clause 3 but because it stood with and
                    was read together with clause 17 which provided the clear words required to
                    effect such a transfer. Tuckey LJ held that (at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In some contracts so-called FIOST clauses do transfer responsibility to
                        charterers, but it does not follow that use of the acronym on its own will
                        always do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Tuckey LJ also approved of the trial judge’s conclusion
                    (whose judgment <em>(“The Jordan II
                    (HC)</em>” is reported in <em>“The Jordan II
                        (CA)”</em> in full at 88) that (at [24] p 92):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Had clause 3 stood alone it would have been
                            arguable that the charterparty would not have contained clear words
                            transferring responsibility for the proper performance of loading,
                            stowing, lashing, securing, dunnaging and discharging the cargo to the
                            charterers. It is in a freight clause and whilst it is apt to
                            transfer liability for the expense of cargo operations it could be said
                            not clearly to transfer responsibility for the proper performance of
                            cargo operations</em>; see in this respect the South African case
                        of <em>The Sea Joy</em> [1998] (1) SA 487. However, it
                        is not necessary for me to determine the effect of clause 3 had it
                        stood alone because it does not stand alone. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     This brings me to two important points. First,
                    unlike <em>The Jordan II(CA)</em>, other than the f.i.s.
                    l/s/d term in Box 10 of the Booking Note, in the present case there is
                    significantly no other clause in the Booking Note that Subiaco can point to
                    as providing clear words to transfer responsibility and risk of loading to the
                    defendant. The f.i.s. l/s/d term on its own does not transfer the responsibility
                    and risk of loading to the defendant, and I so hold. In fact, there are printed
                    clauses on page 1 of the Booking Note that reinforce this finding. I refer to
                    clauses 4, 8 and 18 of the Booking Note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Clause 4 of Booking Note is consistent
                    with the f.i.s. l/s/d term in Box 10, and it underscores the fact that
                    responsibility and risk for loading operations remain with Subiaco as shipowner
                    and carrier. Clause 4 deals with the period of responsibility <em>before</em> loading. It expressly states that “the
                    Carrier or his Agents shall not be liable for loss of or damage to the goods
                    during the period <em>before</em> loading and after
                    discharge from the vessel however such loss or damage arises”. In the
                    absence of any express provision to the contrary, it is clear that the
                    responsibility of loading and stowage of the goods remains with Subiaco.
                    Notably, by clause 2 the Booking Note (<em>ie</em>,
                    the paramount clause), the contract was expressly made subject to the Hague or
                    Hague Visby Rules. In this regard, Art III r 2 of the Hague or Hague-Visby
                    Rules applies since there is no provision in the Booking Note to vary or
                    contract out of Subiaco’s loading obligations under Art III r 2 (see
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above). In short, clause 4 can
                    be read harmoniously with Art III r 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I now turn to clause 8 of the Booking
                    Note and will compare it with the f.i.s. l/s/d term in Box 10. The f.i.s. l/s/d
                    term deals with the expense of loading, stowing, lashing, securing and dunnaging
                    of the goods at load port whereas the carrier under clause 8 is to
                        <em>arrange</em> for loading (which activity includes
                    stowage, see <em>Scrutton</em> at p 158 which is
                    referred to in <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> below). Furthermore,
                    clause 8 requires the Merchant to <em>tender</em> the
                    goods to the carrier for loading. The rest of the clause refers to
                        <em>loading</em> of the goods by the carrier who
                    retains the right to shut out the goods in the circumstances described in
                    clause 8.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Lastly, the “Himalayan”
                    clause (in clause 18) provides for exemptions and immunities of all
                    servants and agents of the carrier. It is clear that the abovementioned clauses
                        (<em>ie</em>, clauses 4, 8 and 18) are consistent with
                    the fact that responsibility for the loading operations at load port remained
                    with Subiaco as shipowner and carrier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     At this juncture, I should mention
                    Mr Bhandari’s reliance on the defendant’s agreement to pay
                    demurrage as a factor to support its argument that Subiaco could not have
                    undertaken responsibility for the cargo operations. Mr Bhandari submits
                    that it would not make any sense for the defendant to agree to pay demurrage if
                    the obligation to load the cargo was placed on Subiaco. Mr Bhandari’s
                    argument breaks down at this point. There is an element of circularity in
                    seeking to derive assistance from the demurrage provision in the Booking Note to
                    ascertain the true construction of the f.i.s. l/s/d term. Box 11 of the Booking
                    Note provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.   Demurrage/Detention rate (if agreed)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">USD 7,500 per day pro rata</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If cargo and/or documents not ready at loading and/or discharging</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Box 13 is for the special terms. It provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13. Special terms, if agreed</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">- Carried under deck only</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">- 3 weather working days SHINC allowed for loading</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">- ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Both Patrick and Henrik explained that VCM was
                    having problems with meeting the vessel’s laycan, and as such demurrage
                    was re-negotiated. The parties agreed on a laytime of three weather working days
                    SHINC for loading, and deleted the original “Loading CQD” term in
                    Box 13.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The demurrage rate was
                    also changed from “US$12,500” to “US$7,500” per day
                    pro rata.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In any case, the
                    demurrage clauses in Box 11 and Box 13 do not import an obligation to load the
                    cargo on the defendant. It merely provides that the defendant has to pay
                    demurrage in the event the vessel is detained beyond the laytime
                    stipulated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Moving to my second point, Subiaco cited a
                    large number of English cases in support of its submissions. Again, none of the
                    English authorities assist Subiaco. Unlike the present case, the English cases
                    usually involved charterparty clauses (such as New York Produce Exchange form,
                    Stemmor form, Gencon form, and Baltime form) where clear words are used to
                    transfer the expense, responsibility and risk of loading to the charterers. In
                    this regard, the editors of <em>Voyage Charters</em>
                    commented that no general rule can be derived from those cases save for the
                    proposition in the <em>Jordan II (CA )</em> that each case
                    depends upon the wording of the clause in question and the context in which
                    is made. That said, <em>Voyage Charters</em>, at
                    para 14.55, sets out some guidelines to construction deduced from some of
                    the authorities:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Since the responsibility for loading and
                            discharging operations within the ship, and for stowage, is normally
                            that of the owner, clear words are necessary to transfer the
                            responsibility for these operations to the charterer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    A clause which confers upon the charterer the
                            right to appoint stevedores does not, without more, transfer to him the
                            responsibility for their acts or omissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    A clause which makes the charterer responsible
                            for the expense of employing stevedores to perform loading, stowage or
                            discharging does not, without more, transfer
                        responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    A clause which provides that the charterer
                            shall perform loading, stowage or discharging does transfer
                            responsibility for those operations. It was said to have been rightly
                            conceded in The Jordan II that if all cargo work had to be performed by
                            the charterer, he would be liable if it was not properly and carefully
                            carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     With the above guidelines to construction in
                    mind, I repeat that any departure from the shipowner’s duty to load and
                    stow is founded on express terms and do not arise by implication of law or by
                    implication from the charterparty or, in this case, the Booking Note. I held in
                        <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above that, in this particular
                    case, the f.i.s. l/s/d term which appears in connection with the freight rate in
                    Box 10 does not without more transfer responsibility for loading to the
                    defendant. “Free” in the f.i.s. l/s/d term does not mean free of
                    risk <em>and</em> expense following the natural meaning of
                    “Free” in the <em>Jordan II (CA)</em>. In
                    this case, the natural meaning of “Free” is that of being at no
                    cost to Subiaco. The f.i.s. l/s/d term complements clause 8 which provides
                    that loading and discharging is to be <em>arranged</em> by
                    the carrier’s agent unless otherwise agreed. No agreement has otherwise
                    been expressly agreed in the Booking Note. The obligation to arrange loading was
                    not “otherwise agreed” by the f.i.s. l/s/d term which relates only
                    to the expense of cargo operations at the load port. I have already pointed out
                    that the question of risk has to be distinguished from expense, meaning the
                    costs of and associated with the cargo operations at the load port (see
                        <em>Scrutton</em> at p 158 where stowage and
                    lashing to secure the goods are said to be part of loading
                operation).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For completeness, I should mention the case of
                        <em>Olbert Metal Sales Ltd v Cerescropt Inc (T.D.)</em>
                    [1997] 1 FC 899 (“<em>Olbert
                        Metal</em>”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> It is one of the many
                    authorities referred to by Mr Bhandari, and ostensibly supports his
                    contention. <em>Olbert Metal</em> is a Canadian case
                    decided by a single judge in the trial division of the Federal Court of Canada,
                    Vancouver. In that case, the court was simply asked to decide on two motions:
                    the plaintiffs’ motion for discontinuance, and the defendants’
                    motion for an affidavit verifying the destruction of documents. I do not see how
                    that case can assist Subiaco. In relation to the bill of lading marked
                    “FISLO” (<em>ie</em>, Free in stow, liner
                    out), the judge simply stated that the term indicated the shipper’s
                    obligation to load and stow with the cost of the discharge included in the
                    freight. There was no discussion of how the Judge arrived at his view which was
                    confined to the paragraph [7] of the case report. Henrik has also confirmed
                    during cross-examination that Subiaco is relying only on the f.i.s. l/s/d term
                    in support of its claim that the responsibility for carrying out the cargo
                    operations has been transferred to the defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                    I have already concluded that the f.i.s. l/s/d term of itself does not transfer
                    loading operations to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The extended meaning argument: can the f.i.s l/s/d term be given an
                extended meaning based on the facts and circumstances of the case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Mr Bhandari submits that the f.i.s l/s/d
                    term can be given an extended meaning that transfers both expense and risk of
                    cargo operations at the load port to the defendant. This extended meaning, he
                    argues, is based on the facts and circumstances of the case.
                    Mr Bhandari’s arguments are inspired by Tuckey LJ’s
                    observations in the <em>Jordan II (CA)</em> at [15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have been referred to a number of cases in which the courts have had to
                        consider whether the words in a particular contract do or do not transfer
                        the obligation to carry out cargo work. These cases are helpfully summarised
                        and commented upon in Voyage Charters (2nd edn., 2001) at paras. 14.53
                        – 14.55. <em>I think, however, that the only sure
                            principle which can be derived from these cases is that each case
                            depends upon the contract in question and the context in which it is
                            made</em>. I agree with the editors of Scrutton on Charterparties
                        20th edn. (1996) at p. 175 that <em>no general rule can be
                            derived from these</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Bhandari also relies heavily on
                        <em>Canadian Transport Company Limited v Court Line
                        Limited</em> [1940] 1 AC 934 (“<em>Canadian Transport</em>”). In particular, Subiaco has sought
                    to rely on the conduct of the defendant, and the course of dealings between the
                    parties to prove that the f.i.s. l/s/d term has an extended meaning. In the
                    following sections, I will examine the cases of <em>Jordan II
                        (CA)</em> and <em>Canadian Transport</em>, the
                    conduct of the defendant, and the course of dealings between the parties to
                    determine the validity of Subiaco’s extended meaning
                argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Before I begin with an examination of the two
                    cases, it should be stated that it is not Subiaco’s case that the terms of
                    the contract of affreightment are partly in writing, partly inferred by conduct
                    and/or through a course of dealings. Subiaco is relying on extrinsic evidence
                    – the conduct of the defendant and the previous course of dealings
                        - as an aid to construction. On any view, I do not see
                    how the so-called extrinsic evidence will advance Subiaco’s case in light
                    of the superseding clause in the Booking Note, which provides that
                        “<em>this Contract [ie, the Booking Note] shall be
                        performed subject to the terms contained on page 1 and 2 which shall prevail
                        over any previous arrangements</em>” (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). In this regard, this portion of the
                    superseding clause effectively negates any oral terms which the parties may
                    have agreed upon between themselves by the conduct of the defendant. By the same
                    token, any term arising by implication from the previous course of dealings or
                    the facts and circumstances of the present action will also be negated. That
                    said, it is arguable that the use of the words “previous
                    arrangements” seek to expressly preclude as an aid to construction any
                    reference to background facts, prior conduct and/or previous course of dealings
                    (see <em>Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 537 at [41]). Mr Bhandari may say that it is still open
                    to Subiaco to argue that the italicised portion of the superseding
                    clause does not prevent a court from adopting a contextual approach in
                    contract interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i) Jordan II (CA) and Canadian Transport</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     At the outset, the cases of <em>Jordan II (CA)</em> and <em>Canadian
                        Transport</em> do not support Mr Bhandari’s argument that
                    the f.i.s. l/s/d term could be given an extended meaning based on the facts and
                    circumstances of the case. In <em>Jordan II (CA)</em>, the
                    English Court of Appeal clearly held that the default position at common law is
                    that the obligation to carry out the cargo operations was on the shipowner, and
                    clear words are required if this responsibility is to be transferred from the
                    shipowner to the charterer. Mr Bhandari’s argument is that it may be
                    inferred from the words used in the context of the case that the defendant or
                    the FOB shipper (<em>ie</em>, VCM) is to perform the
                    loading operations. Even if this was so, I find that Subiaco has not shown any
                    words from which such a transfer of responsibility to the defendant can be
                    inferred. The earlier comments in <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> made
                    with reference to the meaning of “Free” and clause 8 of the
                    Booking Note are also relevant to this part of the analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>Canadian
                        Transport</em>, a cargo of wheat was damaged due to improper stowage.
                    The owners were liable to the receivers of the cargo for the damage and claimed
                    an indemnity from the charterers. Of particular interest to the present action
                    is the fact that clause 8 of the charterparty provided that (at
                    p 937):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The charterers are to load, stow, and trim the cargo at
                            their expense under the supervision of the captain</em> who is to
                        sign bills of lading for cargo, as presented in conformity with mates or
                        tally clerks’ receipts. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The House of Lords held that the words in italics necessarily import
                    that the responsibility for those cargo operations was transferred to the
                    charterers. As such, the shipowners were entitled to receive an indemnity from
                    the charterers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is noteworthy that clause 8 in
                        <em>Canadian Transport</em> is by all accounts very
                    similar to clause 17 in the <em>Jordan II</em>
                        (<em>CA</em>), which provided that the
                    shipper/charterers/receivers were to “put the cargo on board, trim and
                    discharge free of expense to the vessel”. <em>Canadian
                        Transport</em> concerned the effect of the intervention proviso in
                    clause 8. It was held in the <em>Jordan II</em>
                        (<em>CA)</em> that when read with clause 3 (which
                    stated that freight was payable “FIOST lashed/secured/dunnaged”),
                    clause 17 provided the clear words necessary to transfer the responsibility
                    to carry out the cargo operations from the shipowner to the charterers.
                    Therefore, it was not surprising that the House of Lords in <em>Canadian Transport</em> went on to hold that clause 8 provided
                    the clear words which transferred the responsibility for the loading and stowing
                    of the cargo to the charterers, and thereby relieved the shipowners of
                    liability. As the court in <em>Jordan II (HC)</em> pointed
                    out at [23], <em>Canadian Transport</em> “was not a
                    decision on the meaning of the acronym FIOST standing
                alone”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     From the above discussion, it is clear that
                    both <em>Jordan II</em> (<em>CA</em>)
                    and <em>Canadian Transport</em> involved clear words which
                    transferred the responsibility for the cargo operations from the shipowner to
                    the charterer. Reading these two cases in their proper context,
                    Mr Bhandari’s reliance on these two cases - to
                    argue that an agreement that the charterer/shipper is to perform the cargo
                    operations may be inferred from the words used in the context of the case
                    – is misplaced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     More importantly, and as stated, Subiaco has
                    not been able to point to any words, either in the Booking Note or the bills of
                    lading, which expressly or inferentially transfer the responsibility to carry
                    out the cargo operations from itself to the defendant. In the present action,
                    Subiaco is relying only on the f.i.s. l/s/d term in support of its claim that
                    the responsibility for carrying out the cargo operations had been transferred to
                    the defendant. Accordingly, <em>Canadian Transport</em> is
                    of no assistance to Subiaco.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Conduct of the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Bhandari argues that the f.i.s. l/s/d
                    term can be given an extended meaning based on the conduct of the defendant,
                    that is to say, the defendant appointed agents and/or representatives at the
                    load port, namely VMC to carry out the cargo operations, and the cargo
                    operations were carried out by stevedores from Hoang Dieu, being the stevedoring
                    company appointed by VMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Bhandari also contends that where the
                    charterer has to arrange and pay for all cargo operations, stevedores even if in
                    practice appointed and paid for by the charterer’s clients would, as
                    between the shipowner and charterer, be regarded as the charterer’s
                    stevedores. According to Mr Bhandari, this principle is grounded on common
                    sense because it is not in dispute that the defendant, BHS, was liable for the
                    loading costs and that VMC were in effect loading the cargo on behalf of the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr Bhandari’s argument is firstly
                    premised on a finding that the Booking Note obliges the defendant to <em>arrange and pay</em> for the cargo operations at load port. I
                    have already ruled that there was no such obligation. Secondly, VMC was the FOB
                    seller and the buyer was not BHS but BHDF Aberdeen. The FOB seller’s duty
                    is to “make available at the port of loading and to ship free on
                    board” the contractual cargo, and to pay all handling and transport
                    charges in connection with the aforesaid cargo loading operation (see David M
                    Sassoon, <em>CIF and FOB Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 4th Ed, 1995) at para 442 (“<em>Sassoon</em>”). It is not inconceivable that the loading
                    operations arranged by VCM were in discharge of its own obligations under the
                    FOB sale contract as argued by BHS. Thirdly, Subiaco’s conclusion that VCM
                    was the defendant’s agent is based on Box 12 of the Booking Note where
                    VCM’s name and address appeared as the Merchant’s representative at
                    the load port. The defendant has repeatedly denied an agency relationship with
                    VCM. I note that Henrik and Dennis Gallagher, a director of Subiaco, conceded
                    that Subiaco has no other evidence that VCM was the defendant’s agent
                    having no knowledge of the arrangement between the two entities. Contrary to
                    Mr Bhandari’s submissions, there is no evidence that VCM were asked
                    to carry out the cargo operations at Haiphong as the agent of the defendant, or
                    that VCM appointed the stevedoring company on the defendant’s behalf.
                    Mr Bhandari’s reliance on Box 12 is ill-founded and misplaced. First,
                    it was Henrik who inserted the name and address of VCM in Box 12; the
                    information did not come from Patrick. Second, the purpose of inserting a name
                    in Box 12 was for communication. Henrik explained at [35] of his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of inserting the Merchant’s
                        “representatives” name in Box 12 of the Booking Note is so
                        that the carrier can inform their port agent whom they should contact, so
                        that the port agent can keep the Merchant’s representative updated on
                        the Vessel’s arrival and other port formalities that need to be
                        carried out prior to the Vessel’s arrival.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It is clear from Henrik’s written
                    testimony that the fact that VMC was named as the Merchant’s
                    representative in the Booking Note did not necessarily mean that VMC appointed
                    the stevedores to carry out the cargo operations on behalf of the defendant. I
                    accept as plausible the defendant’s evidence that it did not appoint the
                    stevedores or require and/or ask VMC to appoint stevedores on its behalf.
                    Instead, it was VMC who appointed the stevedores in discharge of its obligations
                    under the sale on FOB terms. AG Guest <em>et al</em>,
                        <em>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2006) at para 20-012 provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is the duty of an f.o.b. seller to put the goods on
                            board a ship nominated or designated by the buyer</em>…it
                        must be emphasized that a mere “delivery of the goods to a
                        carrier” within that subsection [section 32(1) of the Sale of Goods
                        Act 1979] is not sufficient to discharge the seller’s duty under a
                        f.o.b. contract, since <em>he must not merely deliver the
                            goods to the carrier but actually put them on board the ship</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Bhandari cited the case of <em>The Flintermar</em> [2005] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 409
                    at [42]-[43] in support of its argument that the stevedores, even if they were,
                    in practice, appointed and paid for by the charterer’s clients (<em>ie</em>, VCM), they would, as between the shipowner and the
                    charterer, be regarded as the charterer’s stevedores. However, it is
                    important to note that it was expressly agreed in that case that the charterer
                    was “to arrange” the cargo operations. This is in contrast to the
                    present action, where clause 8 of page 1 of the Booking Note expressly
                    provides that it was for Subiaco to arrange for loading unless otherwise agreed.
                    Subiaco has not been able to prove that there was such an agreement
                    “otherwise” (see also <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Besides clause 8, there is no
                    clause in the Booking Note conferring the right to appoint stevedores upon
                    the defendant. Even if, for the sake of argument, the stevedoring company was
                    somehow appointed by the defendant, it does not of itself mean that the
                    defendant is responsible for the acts or omissions of the stevedoring company.
                    As case law has made clear, in the absence of clear words transferring the
                    responsibility for the cargo operations to the defendant, Subiaco remains
                    responsible for the cargo operations at load port. In this regard, the
                    commentary in <em>Scrutton</em> at p 160 is
                    instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is very usual to find a provision in charterparties whereby the
                        charterer secures the right to appoint a stevedore and under such a
                        clause a question often arises whether a stevedore so appointed is, as
                        between the owners and the charterers, the servant of the owners or the
                        charterers. No general rule can be derived from the cases. <em>Where, however, the responsibility for stowage is not
                            transferred from the owner to the charterer, and remains with the owner,
                            it seems probable that in most cases the stevedore, though appointed or
                            nominated by the charterer, is the servant of the shipowner</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Against the finding that the responsibility for loading was not
                    transferred to the defendant under the f.i.s. l/s/d term, even though the
                    stevedoring company, Hoang Dieu, was engaged by VCM to handle the loading of the
                    cargo at Haiphong, it would probably be the servant or agent of Subiaco as
                    described in the above passage from <em>Scrutton</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It is also clear from Mr Bhandari’s
                    closing submissions on this point that he is proceeding on the basis that the
                    responsibility for the cargo operations has been transferred to the defendant.
                    For example, in arguing that the defendant’s position as to VMC’s
                    role in undertaking the cargo operations for itself is untenable,
                    Mr Bhandari submits:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The case law clearly establishes that where the
                            charterer</em> (or the merchant, under a booking note) <em>assumed the contractual obligation of performing the cargo
                            operations</em>, it matters not if those operations were in fact
                        performed by a shipper or receiver or other person who is not a party to the
                        contract of carriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The authorities that Mr Bhandari has
                    relied on all involved facts whereby there were clear words which transferred
                    the obligation to carry out the cargo operations to the charterers or shippers
                    (see, for example, <em>Brys &amp; Glysen v Drysdale</em>
                    [1920] 4 Lloyd’s Rep 24 and <em>The Apostolis (No
                        2)</em> [2000] 2 Lloyd’s Report 337). These
                    authorities are clearly inconsistent with the factual matrix of the present
                    action, where such clear words are not present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In light of the above, Subiaco cannot rely on
                    the conduct of the defendant to justify an extension of the meaning of the
                    f.i.s. l/s/d term so that the defendant was obliged to carry out the cargo
                    operations at its own risk and expense, and be held liable for the alleged
                    negligence of the stevedore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Established course of dealings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I now come to the next consideration which may
                    be summarised thus: Against the background of an established course of dealings,
                    how is the freight term in Box 10 to be construed?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Bhandari is arguing that the f.i.s.
                    l/s/d term has an extended meaning because of an established course of dealings
                    between the parties since around June 2007, whereby Subiaco had previously
                    shipped bagged barites for the defendant from Haiphong to Dampier and Darwin on
                    “free in stowed” terms, and the usual and/or customary procedure
                    utilised by the parties was for the defendant to carry out the cargo operations
                    through its stevedores’ agents or representatives appointed at the load
                    port. For the alleged three previous shipments of the defendant’s goods,
                    one was on board the vessel <em>Achilles</em> (“AC
                    701”), while the other two were on board the vessel <em>Territory Trader</em> (“TT 703” and “TT
                    705”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The three shipments were previously arranged
                    by Henrik and Patrick. Henrik had stated that the carriage of the cargo on the
                    basis of the f.i.s. l/s/d term was in accordance with the “usual
                    practice” that Patrick and he had adopted for the previous shipments of
                    barites from Haiphong, namely, the three previous shipments: AC 701,
                    TT 703 and TT 705.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     For the AC 701 shipment on board the
                        <em>Achilles</em>, the “Conlinebooking”
                    standard form was used. Moreover, the terms in Boxes 10 to 13 were identical to
                    the Booking Note in the present action. It is common ground that the <em>Territory Trader</em> did not belong to Subiaco, and the TT
                    703 and TT 705 shipments did not involve the use of booking notes. There are
                    also no documents to show the agreed terms. According to Henrik, these shipments
                    were on “free in” (which he understood to mean “free in
                    stowed”) and “free in stowed” terms
                        respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This is in contrast to Patrick, who
                    stated that both shipments were on “free in” terms. Despite these
                    differences, it is clear that the shipments were on terms which were different
                    to the f.i.s. l/s/d term in the present action. In short, there was no
                    consistency in the course of dealings between Subiaco and the defendant to give
                    rise to an established practice. More importantly, according to Henrik, Mocean
                    and not Subiaco time chartered the <em>Territory
                        Trader</em> and the counterparty for the TT 703 and TT 705 shipments
                    was Mocean and not Subiaco. It is also unclear, evidentially, whether the
                    defendant contracted with Mocean, and Subiaco in the case of AC 701,
                    in its own right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the circumstances, there is no established
                    course of dealings between the parties to justify the extension of the meaning
                    of the f.i.s. l/s/d term as imposing on the defendant to obligation to carry out
                    the cargo operations at its own risk and expense so as to be made liable to
                    Subiaco for the alleged negligence of the stevedore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the defendant appointed or arranged for the stevedores
                through their representatives (VMC) at the load port</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Subiaco has a fallback argument advanced as
                    its alternative case. The argument is that, in the context of the case, the
                    f.i.s. l/s/d term meant that BHS had agreed to appoint or arrange for the
                    stevedores through its representatives (<em>ie</em>, VMC)
                    at the load port. Consequently, it was an implied term of the contract of
                    carriage that BHS (through its representatives) would appoint and/or nominate
                    reasonably competent stevedores to carry out the cargo operations. Subiaco
                    asserts that BHS had breached this duty because the stevedore who operated the
                    crane in this case was incompetent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Subiaco’s alternative case is premised
                    on the defendant’s appointment of the stevedoring company. It is common
                    ground that it was VMC who appointed and/or arranged for the stevedoring company
                    to load the cargo. The issues of whether it was an implied term of the contract
                    of carriage that the defendant, through VMC, would appoint and/or nominate
                    reasonably competent stevedores to carry out the cargo operations, and whether
                    the defendant has subsequently breached that duty will only be relevant if VMC
                    is found to have appointed and/or arranged for the stevedores to carry out the
                    cargo operations on behalf of the defendant. It is no longer a
                    “live” issue given my finding on this point in <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> and <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a>
                    above where I accepted that the stevedoring company was not appointed by the
                    defendant or on its behalf. It was VMC who appointed and/or arranged for the
                    stevedores to carry out the cargo operations for itself in discharge of its own
                    obligations under the sale on FOB terms. It follows that there can be no implied
                    term that the defendant would appoint and/or nominate reasonably competent
                    stevedores to carry out the cargo operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It remains to be said that having reached the
                    conclusion that the loading operations were not at the risk of the defendant,
