The appellant, Evan Lim Industrial/Warehousing Development Pte Ltd (“Evan Lim”), a creditor of the Company, challenged the Liquidators’ acceptance of MWA’s proof of debt, contending that the interest and default interest rates charged by MWA were “excessive and unconscionable or substantially unfair” under s 23(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the MLA”). This appeal focussed on whether Evan Lim had succeeded in proving that the requirements set out in s 23(1) were met. We dismissed the appeal on 2 August 2018 with brief oral grounds, indicating that we would explain our decision in greater detail in due course. This we do now.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In or around 2011, the Company was involved in developing a condominium at 6, 8 and 10 Devonshire Road and 130 Killiney Road (collectively referred to as “the D8 Property”). The development project was financed by United Overseas Bank Limited (“UOB”), which held a legal mortgage over, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the D8 Property. Subsequently, the development project ran into financial difficulties, and Lee Siew Noi Ivy (“Ivy Lee”), the sole director and shareholder of the Company, borrowed money from various non-bank sources in an attempt to tide the Company over these difficulties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The loans extended to the Company from 2011 to 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Before we come to MWA’s loan to the Company in July 2014, it is helpful to set out in brief the other loans extended to the Company from 2011 to 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The loan from Evan Lim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 25 May 2011, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Evan Lim under which Evan Lim was to contribute $5,528,433.45 towards the development of the D8 Property, and the Company was to repay Evan Lim that principal amount plus an additional 40% within three years. This worked out to interest of 13.33% per year. The parties subsequently clarified in a settlement agreement concluded on 18 June 2014 between the Company, Evan Lim and Ivy Lee (“the First Settlement Agreement”) that the joint venture agreement of 25 May 2011 “was intended to be a loan agreement” for the sum of $5,525,020. The First Settlement Agreement also confirmed that as at 25 May 2014, the Company owed Evan Lim the sum of $7,735,028 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $5,525,020 plus the 40% uplift). As part of the First Settlement Agreement, Evan Lim granted the Company two additional months to repay the accrued debt of $7,735,028 in consideration for payment of an additional sum of $773,503, which was 10% of the accrued debt. In other words, Evan Lim wanted interest at the rate of 10% for two months (or 60% per annum) in return for granting the Company a two-month extension to repay the accrued debt. Default interest at the rate of 18% per annum was also payable under the First Settlement Agreement. Ivy Lee guaranteed the performance of the First Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As at 30 January 2015, the Company had paid Evan Lim only $4.6m, leaving a balance of $3,908,531 unpaid. As at 19 June 2015, interest amounting to $728,305.72 (calculated at the stipulated default interest rate of 18% per annum) was payable on this balance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 19 June 2015, the Company, Evan Lim, Ivy Lee and one Chua Choy Soon entered into a further settlement agreement (“the Second Settlement Agreement”) under which the Company agreed to pay Evan Lim the sum of $4,115,031 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the unpaid $3,908,531 plus default interest of $200,000 (which was lower than the actual default interest payable under the 18% per annum default interest rate stipulated in the First Settlement Agreement) and legal costs of $6,500) in two separate tranches. Default interest at the rate of 18% per annum was similarly payable under the Second Settlement Agreement. As no further payments were received under the Second Settlement Agreement, Evan Lim’s proof of debt was for the sum of $4,115,031. Evan Lim did not claim any interest under the Second Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The loan from LR Properties Pte Ltd </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 19 August 2011, the Company entered into a written agreement with LR Properties Pte Ltd (“LR Properties”) under which it was agreed that LR Properties would invest $3.29m in the Company in exchange for a 20% stake in the D8 Property. Subsequently, it became clear that this “investment agreement” was similarly a loan agreement. No interest was charged for this loan, and the loan was neither secured nor guaranteed. LR Properties’ proof of debt against the Company was for the aggregate sum of $4,387,328.40.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The loan from Shirley Ong Hwee Yin</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 13 August 2013, the Company, Ivy Lee and Shirley Ong Hwee Yin (“Shirley Ong”) entered into an agreement whereby Shirley Ong would invest $1.75m in the Company in exchange for a guaranteed return of 40% of the principal amount within 15 months, that is to say, in exchange for payment of $2.45m within 15 months. This worked out to interest at the rate of 32% per annum. Ivy Lee guaranteed the Company’s obligations under this agreement. Again, whilst this agreement was couched in the language of an investment agreement, given the unconditional obligation of full repayment, it was not disputed that it was similarly a loan agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">MWA’s loan in July 2014</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 As can be seen from [4]–[8] above, the Company had been borrowing money from various non-bank sources since 2011. In 2014, it decided to borrow $10m from MWA, a licensed moneylender, to settle some of its other debts. The contractual and default interest rates (collectively “the Interest Rates”) stipulated under the MWA Loan Agreement were 5% and 8% per month respectively, and the effective interest rates were 79.59% and 151.82% per annum respectively. Under the terms of the MWA Loan Agreement, the loan was to be repaid in full within six months from 4 July 2014, the date of drawdown of the $10m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In connection with the MWA Loan Agreement, the Company executed a deed of assignment dated 4 July 2014 over the Company’s rights, titles and interest in several properties, all of which were collectively known in the deed as “the D8 Property”. MWA registered the deed as a charge on 10 December 2014 (“the Charge”). As a registered charge, the Charge ranked behind that of the first legal mortgagee, UOB. An added security for MWA’s loan was a fixed charge granted by a related company, U-Asia Pte Ltd (“U-Asia”), under which U-Asia assigned all of its rights, titles and interest in several units at 12 Devonshire Road to MWA. Finally, Ivy Lee also executed a personal guarantee in favour of MWA. For completeness, U-Asia and Ivy Lee eventually settled their outstanding liabilities and obligations to MWA, and they paid the sum of $1m under the settlement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 3 January 2015, the Company defaulted on the MWA Loan Agreement. On 26 March 2015, MWA commenced Suit No 285 of 2015 (“Suit 285”) against the Company. It obtained summary judgment for the undisputed principal sum of $6,741,310 on 3 August 2015, with the Company being granted unconditional leave to defend MWA’s remaining claims for interest and default interest under the MWA Loan Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The winding up of the Company and the sale of the D8 Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 14 September 2015, following the Company’s default on the sum due under the summary judgment made against it in Suit 285, MWA commenced winding-up proceedings against the Company. On 9 November 2015, the Company was ordered to be wound up. The Liquidators then sold the D8 Property for $25,900,000, and the net proceeds of sale available for distribution to the Company’s creditors, after the redemption of UOB’s legal mortgage and deductions for (amongst other things) the Liquidators’ fees and legal costs, came up to $13,447,721.92 (“the D8 Proceeds”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Liquidators adjudicated MWA’s revised proof of debt as at 9 November 2015 and accepted MWA’s claim in the total sum of $20,617,771.41. The validity of the Charge and, hence, MWA’s status as a secured creditor of the Company was no longer an issue by the time the parties were before the High Court judge (“the Judge”). The prospect facing the general creditors (including Evan Lim) was that the whole of the D8 Proceeds would go to MWA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On 30 September 2016, the Liquidators applied by way of Summons No 4766 of 2016 (“SUM 4766”) for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, an order that they be authorised to: (a) recognise the Charge; and (b) repay monies to MWA as a secured creditor out of the D8 Proceeds. In response to the Liquidators’ application, on 18 May 2017, Evan Lim filed Summons No 2281 of 2017 (“SUM 2281”) to reverse or modify the Liquidators’ decision to affirm the Interest Rates charged under the MWA Loan Agreement. SUM 2281 was filed pursuant to s 315 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) on the grounds that the Interest Rates were “excessive and unconscionable or substantially unfair” under s 23 of the MLA. Whilst LR Properties supported SUM 2281, only Evan Lim appealed against the Judge’s dismissal of the summons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Judge dismissed SUM 2281 on the grounds that Evan Lim had not established that the MWA Loan Agreement was unconscionable or substantially unfair (see <span class="font-italic">MW</span><span class="font-italic">A Capital Pte Ltd v Ivy Lee Realty Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2017] SGHC 216 (“the GD”)). He held that the loan extended by MWA was a business loan, and that the burden was on Evan Lim and LR Properties to prove that the MWA Loan Agreement was unconscionable or substantially unfair under s 23(1) of the MLA (at [91]). They had not, however, succeeded in doing so. Consequently, the Judge allowed the Liquidators’ application in SUM 4766. In so deciding, the Judge left the Interest Rates under the MWA Loan Agreement unchanged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Judge accepted that s 23(1) of the MLA set out two cumulative requirements which had to be satisfied before the court could reopen a loan transaction, namely: (a) the interest or late interest charged had to be excessive; and (b) the transaction had to be unconscionable or substantially unfair. However, the Judge dealt with requirement (b) alone, having come to the view that it was all-encompassing. He explained (at [76] of the GD) that it did not follow from a finding of an excessive interest rate that the loan transaction in question was therefore unconscionable or substantially unfair. With that view in mind, the Judge saw the “real question” before him as whether the MWA Loan Agreement was unconscionable or substantially unfair (see the GD at [77]). We will elaborate on the Judge’s reasoning in the course of explaining our decision on this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues for determination on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 There were two main issues for our determination in this appeal: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether Evan Lim, as an unsecured creditor of the Company, had the <span class="font-italic">locus</span><span class="font-italic"> standi</span> to pray in aid of the court to step in and exercise its statutory powers under s 23(1) of the MLA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether, in respect of the MWA Loan Agreement, the requirements set out in s 23(1) of the MLA for reopening a loan transaction were met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 We will refer to issue (a) as “the Jurisdiction Issue” and issue (b) as “the “Section 23 Issue”. For convenience, s 23(1) of the MLA reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Re-opening of certain transactions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">23.</span>—(1) When proceedings are brought in any court by a licensee [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a licensed moneylender] for the recovery of a loan or the enforcement of a contract for a loan or any guarantee or security given for a loan, and the court is satisfied that <span class="font-italic">the interest or late interest charged in respect of the loan is excessive </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and</span><span class="font-italic"> that the transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair</span>, the court shall re-open the transaction and take an account between the licensee and the person sued. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Jurisdiction Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Liquidators accepted that Evan Lim was entitled to rely on s 315 of the Companies Act to challenge their decision to affirm the Interest Rates charged under the MWA Loan Agreement. However, they contended that since Evan Lim did not fall into any of the classes of persons identified in s 23(4) of the MLA as being eligible to seek relief under s 23(1), it did not have the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to bring its application in SUM 2281. Under s 23(4), the persons who have <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to seek relief under s 23(1) are: (a) borrowers; (b) sureties; and (c) other persons liable to repay the loan owed to the licensed moneylender concerned (in this case, MWA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Clearly, Evan Lim was not “a borrower, a surety or other person liable to repay a loan to a licensee”. However, this did not necessarily preclude the court from considering whether to reopen the MWA Loan Agreement under s 23(1) of the MLA as a result of Evan Lim’s application in SUM 2281, which was made pursuant to s 315 of the Companies Act. In our view, the Liquidators unquestionably had the right to challenge the terms of the MWA Loan Agreement under s 23 of the MLA, and their decision not to make such a challenge was in substance the subject matter of Evan Lim’s application. Evan Lim was ultimately concerned with the conduct of the Company’s liquidation, an issue in which it had a direct interest as a creditor of the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 It is now a convenient juncture to set out s 315 of the Companies Act and s 23(5) of the MLA. Section 315 of the Companies Act reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Appeal against decision of liquidator</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">315.</span> Any person aggrieved by any act or decision of the liquidator may apply to the Court which may confirm, reverse or modify the act or decision complained of and make such order as it thinks just.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Section 23(5) of the MLA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a licensee has filed, in the bankruptcy of a borrower or surety, a proof of debt arising from a loan granted by him, the Official Assignee may exercise such powers as may be exercised by a court under this section when assessing whether the debt or liability is proved and its value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Under s 327(2) of the Companies Act, the same rules with regard to the rights of creditors and provable debts in bankruptcies apply in the winding up of an insolvent company. As such, in assessing the proofs of debt filed by the Company’s creditors, the Liquidators had the same powers as the Official Assignee under s 23(5) of the MLA; this point was not disputed in the proceedings below (see the GD at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Sections 23(5) of the MLA and 327(2) of the Companies Act make it clear that in assessing a proof of debt, a liquidator “may exercise such powers as may be exercised by a court under [s 23]”. The language of s 23(5) of the MLA is prescriptive rather than mandatory. Accordingly, the Liquidators had the <span class="font-italic">discretion </span>to invoke s 23 of the MLA and determine whether the requirements for reopening the MWA Loan Agreement were met, and if so, to decide on the revised terms of the agreement. In this case, the Liquidators decided to affirm the Interest Rates charged under the MWA Loan Agreement without any changes. This necessarily meant that the Liquidators either decided not to invoke their powers pursuant to s 23(5) of the MLA or<span class="font-italic"> </span>omitted to consider these powers. On either view, Evan Lim was entitled to rely on s 315 of the Companies Act to challenge the Liquidators’ decision. In other words, where the Jurisdiction Issue was concerned, Evan Lim did have the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to seek the court’s intervention under s 23(1) of the MLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 If the position were otherwise, the Liquidators’ decision would be immune from challenge, and this would render nugatory the court’s exercise of supervisory jurisdiction over “<span class="font-italic">all</span> aspects of a liquidator’s conduct of the winding up” [emphasis in original] (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Wing On Christopher and others v ECRC Land Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 817 at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Section 23 Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The two requirements in s 23(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 We turn now to the Section 23 Issue. It was common ground that to succeed in its appeal, Evan Lim had to show that the MWA Loan Agreement came within s 23(1) of the MLA, which we have quoted in full at [18] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It is clear from the statutory language that s 23(1) contains two requirements which are to be read <span class="font-italic">conjunctively</span>. In other words, <span class="font-italic">both</span> requirements must be satisfied before a court will exercise its power to reopen a loan transaction and order an account to be taken between the licensed moneylender in question and the person sued. The two requirements (collectively, “the two limbs”) are that: (a) the interest or late interest charged is “excessive” (“the first limb”); <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">and</span> (b) the loan transaction is “unconscionable or substantially unfair” (“the second limb”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Evan Lim’s argument before us was that the presence of an excessive interest or default interest rate would in itself also lead to the conclusion that the loan transaction concerned was unconscionable or substantially unfair. The ramification of this argument was that a finding of an excessive interest rate would also satisfy the second limb of s 23(1). We had no difficulty rejecting Evan Lim’s argument. As we pointed out in the preceding paragraph, the court’s powers under s 23(1) will not be invoked if only one of the two limbs of this subsection is satisfied. This follows as a matter of the plain language of the statutory provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 We now come to two local decisions where the requirements of s 23(1) did not appear to have been fully adhered to. These are the District Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit Pte Ltd v Chong</span> <span class="font-italic">Kuek Leong</span> [2013] SGMC 3 (“<span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit</span>”) and the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee v Resource Credit Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 5 SLR 402 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee</span>”). We begin with <span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit</span>, Leslie Chew DJ correctly stated that the question of whether the interest rate before the court was excessive and whether the loan transaction concerned was unconscionable or substantially unfair must be assessed with reference to the specific facts of the case. In discussing the interpretation of the two limbs of s 23(1),<span style="color: rgba(31,73,125,1)"> </span>Chew DJ made the following observations, starting with the interpretation of the word “excessive”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29 … [T]he interest rate charged on the unsecured loan is excessive if it is ‘more than necessary, normal or desirable’. There is another important aspect, however. Whether ‘excessive’ or not these interest rates can only be assessed in comparison to something or [some] other rate or measure. Here the observation made by Lord James in <span class="font-italic">Samuel and Another v Newbold [1906] 1 AC 461 </span>[(<span class="font-italic">“Samuel”</span>)]<span class="font-italic"> </span>is useful when he noted at pages 475 – 476 that, <span class="font-italic">“The word “excessive” applied to interest is, of course a relative and elastic term, impossible of absolute definition”</span>. That case arose from a moneylending transaction under the English Moneylenders Act, 1900 which used language similar to our present s 23, in section 1, subsection (1) of the English Act of 1900. If as Lord James observed, the term ‘excessive’ in the present context is <span class="font-italic">‘relative’ </span>it follows [that] ‘excessive’ must be measured or assessed relative to some yardstick. The question then becomes what is that yardstick?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30  The question here is therefore what is ‘excessive’ in the context of the present loan transaction under consideration? Once again, I find that the observations of Lord James in <span class="font-italic">Samuel </span>which I have referred to … [are] helpful. Having noted the relativity and elasticity of the term ‘excessive’, Lord James at p 476, went on to observe as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“But we know the general rate of interest in commercial transactions, and in loans on perfect security. We know the rate of interest juries are in the habit of giving in cases of adjudging damages. But in respect of ordinary loans deviation from these guides, dependent upon the facts of each case, must doubtless be expected and ought to be allowed. But such deviation must be reasonable in relation to facts.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33  … [T]he next [thing] which the court when purporting to exercise its powers under s 23 of the [MLA] to reopen the transaction … must do is to ask whether the transaction is ‘unconscionable or substantially unfair’. What therefore is the meaning of those words?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34  While we may resort to the dictionary for the meaning of those words, what is more useful is yet again to refer to <span class="font-italic">Samuel. </span>In <span class="font-italic">Samuel</span>, the court adopted a simple but in my respectful view, … workable meaning to be assigned to those words. In <span class="font-italic">Samuel</span>, Lord Hereford at p 473 of that case noted that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Excessive interest of itself is sufficient to render a contract harsh and unconscionable”</span>. I would adopt the same interpretation here. As to ‘substantially unfair’ again in my view, it is not entirely unreasonable to interpret ‘unconscionable’ as also amounting to ‘substantially unfair’. It is, I believe, a matter of degree, ‘unconscionable’ being ‘unfair having regard to the circumstances’ whilst ‘substantially unfair’ could be ‘unfair to a lesser degree’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35  So having dealt with the language of the provision, I must now turn to the circumstances of the present case. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The simple issue is whether the interest rates charged in the present case </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">are</span><span class="font-weight-bold">] </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">excessive and therefore unconscionable or substantially unfair</span> so that the court as [the deputy registrar at first instance] did, could re-open the transaction which came before the court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36  Here I would adopt the approach taken by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Samuel. </span>I would therefore examine the interest rates involved here relative to [the] general and other prevailing interest rates and allowing for a ‘deviation’ from these based on the particular facts of the present loan transaction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As can be seen from the above extract, in <span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit</span>, Chew DJ appeared to adopt the view (at [34]–[36]) that a finding of an excessive interest rate would in and of itself lead to the conclusion that the loan transaction in question was unconscionable or substantially unfair (see also <span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit</span> at [51(e)] and [63]). With respect, we disagree with this approach, which is misleading and also takes the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Samuel and </span><span class="font-italic">another v Newbold </span>[1906] 1 AC 461 (“<span class="font-italic">Samuel</span>”) out of its proper context. The statutory provision considered in <span class="font-italic">Samuel</span> was the then Money-lenders Act 1900 (c 51) (UK), which provided a power similar to that in s 23(1) of the MLA as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">1.— Re-opening of transactions of money-lender.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1.)

[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">Samuel</span>, the House of Lords dealt with the question of whether an excessive rate of interest could in itself be evidence that the loan transaction concerned was “harsh and unconscionable”. Whilst the House of Lords unanimously answered this question in the affirmative, the effect of its decision is <span class="font-italic">not</span> that a finding of an excessive interest rate would invariably lead to the conclusion that the transaction was “harsh and unconscionable”. This much is clear from the leading judgment of Lord Loreburn LC (see <span class="font-italic">Samuel</span> at 466):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Under the Money-lenders Act, 1900, s. 1, sub-s. 1, a Court may re-open a transaction and take an account between the money-lender and the person sued <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">upon two conditions</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">first condition</span> is that the interest charged in respect of the sum actually lent is excessive, or that the amounts charged for expenses, inquiries, fines, bonus, premium, renewals or any other charges, are excessive. There cannot be any doubt that the interest charged in this case is, under the circumstances, excessive. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second condition</span> is that the contract is harsh and unconscionable, or is otherwise such that a Court of Equity would give relief. … [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is clear from the above passage that Lord Loreburn was well aware that there were two distinct conditions which had to be met in order to trigger the court’s power to reopen a loan transaction. This is for good reason because if Chew DJ’s suggestion that the second limb of s 23(1) of the MLA would be satisfied so long as the first limb is met is correct, the distinct inquiry involved under the second limb would be rendered nugatory. The two conditions also underscore the legal burden which the borrower has to discharge in order to persuade the court to reopen the loan transaction.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 With regard to the more pertinent question of whether an excessive rate of interest could in itself be evidence that the loan transaction concerned was “harsh and unconscionable”, the House of Lords merely noted that it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">could</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">be</span>, and not that it would invariably be. This was made clear by Lord Loreburn at 467 (see also Lord Macnaghten’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Samuel</span> at 470):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… What the Court has to do in such circumstances is, if satisfied that the interest or charges are excessive, to see whether in truth and fact and according to its sense of justice the transaction was harsh and unconscionable. We are asked to say that an excessive rate of interest could not be of itself evidence that it was so. I do not accept that view. Excess of interest or charges <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">may</span> of itself be such evidence, and particularly if it be unexplained. … [emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Similar observations were made by the other law lords. For instance, Lord James of Hereford observed as follows (at 473–474):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Proof of excessive interest <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">may</span> of itself, therefore, be sufficient to entitle the debtor to relief. … When excessive interest is apparently established, any facts that tend to shew that such excess does not render the contract “harsh and unconscionable” should be proved in evidence by the lender. This burthen is on him. … [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Lord Atkinson also noted, with regard to the inquiry into whether the loan transaction in question was “harsh and unconscionable”, that “[i]t will, of course, be always competent for the lender to shew that, despite the excessive rate of interest, the transaction was in fact fair and reasonable” (at 477). In other words, the House of Lords saw it fit, upon there being evidence of an excessive interest rate, to place the evidential burden of proof on the lender to show that the loan transaction was <span class="font-italic">not</span> harsh and unconscionable. This is not the same as saying that the second limb of s 23(1) of the MLA would invariably be met once the first limb is satisfied, which is what Chew DJ’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit</span> appears to suggest. To avoid any doubt, we therefore reiterate, as was also noted by the Judge (see [76] of the GD, which we referred to earlier at [16] above), that it does not invariably follow from a finding of an excessive interest rate that the loan transaction in question would therefore be considered either unconscionable or substantially unfair. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Turning now to <span class="font-italic">Ang Ai Tee</span>, Tan Siong Thye J correctly stated in that case that the two requirements in s 23(1) of the MLA must both be satisfied before the court will reopen a loan transaction and examine its merits, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the court must be satisfied <span class="font-italic">both</span> that the interest charged is excessive <span class="font-italic">and</span> that the loan transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair. Tan J then went on to construe the meaning of “excessive”, “unconscionable” and “substantially unfair”. He said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40  These terms, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, excessive, unconscionable and substantially unfair, are not defined under the MLA or the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed). Therefore we have to rely on the plain and simple dictionary meaning of these terms. The <span class="font-italic">Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English </span>(Pearson Longman, 6th Ed, 2014) (“the <span class="font-italic">Longman Dictionary</span>”) defines “excessive” as “exceeding the usual, proper, or normal”. Hence, the interest charged has to be above the normal rate of interest. In addition, the transaction must also be “unconscionable or substantially unfair”. Again, the <span class="font-italic">Longman Dictionary </span>defines “unconscionable” as “not guided or controlled by conscience; unscrupulous; excessive, unreasonable; shockingly unfair or unjust”. “Substantial” is further defined as “considerable” or “significant”. Hence, not only must the interest charged be above the norm, but the transaction taken as a whole must <span class="font-italic">also </span>cause an average person to view the loan transaction by the moneylender as unscrupulous or dishonest. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Having considered the dictionary meaning of the words “excessive”, “unconscionable” and “substantially unfair”, Tan J articulated (at [40]) his understanding of the requirements in s 23(1) of the MLA by reference to a loan transaction that would be viewed by an average person as “unscrupulous or dishonest”. It is evident from Tan J’s subsequent analysis in his judgment that in assessing the circumstances and features of the loan in question, he rightly did not use the explanatory words “unscrupulous or dishonest” to replace the precise words used in the statute. However, and with respect, his explanatory words, together with his formulation involving an average person’s view, appeared to lay down a catch-all test for the second limb of s 23(1), in that it gave the impression that the second limb consists of only one ground rather than two alternative grounds. In our judgment, it is clear from the wording of s 23(1) that the second limb spells out two alternative statutory grounds, namely, that the loan transaction concerned is “unconscionable <span class="font-italic">or</span> substantially unfair” [emphasis added]; it does not require both grounds to be satisfied. Each of these grounds has a different threshold: substantial unfairness is merely one indicia of unconscionability (see also <span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit</span> at [34]), and other factors may have to co-exist in order for the court to find that the loan transaction in question is unconscionable. Having said that, from a practical standpoint, a court that is asked to exercise its powers under s 23(1) of the MLA should conduct a holistic review of the entirety of the evidence presented to it, rather than adopt a narrow approach that pigeonholes the case at the outset into one or other of the two alternative grounds under the second limb of s 23(1). With these considerations in mind, we turn to the first limb of s 23(1).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first limb of s 23(1): Whether the Interest Rates were excessive</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In order to satisfy the first limb of s 23(1) of the MLA, Evan Lim had to show that the Interest Rates charged under the MWA Loan Agreement were excessive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Judge decided the first limb of s 23(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The parties differed as to whether the Judge had decided the issue of whether the Interest Rates were excessive. We agreed with the Liquidators and MWA that the Judge <span class="font-italic">could not </span>be said to have decided<span class="font-italic"> </span>this issue. In the GD, the Judge went through the evidence of the interest rates put forth before him, and, after noting that those interest rates were inappropriate as comparators, he did not go on to decide whether the first limb of s 23(1) of the MLA was satisfied; instead, he went on to consider the second limb. This much was clear from the following passage of the GD (at [77]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the case before me, the Opposing Creditors [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Evan Lim and LR Properties] provided some information as to the interest rates charged by banks, which ranged from 0.75% per annum to 5.25% per annum. It was undisputed that MWA’s rates far exceeded [those] charged by banks. <span class="font-italic">Its rates were clearly excessive </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in that sense</span><span class="font-italic">, although this was </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not too surprising</span><span class="font-italic"> as there was </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no suggestion that moneylenders would charge interest rates close to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[those] charged by banks</span>. Indeed, as I will elaborate later, there was evidence that other lenders who are not banks were also charging the Company high interest rates. It was also telling that even the Opposing Creditors suggested that MWA should be entitled to an interest rate [of] between 10% and 20% per annum since MWA’s loan was secured. There was also an alternative suggestion of between 20% and 30% per annum. Such interest rates are much higher than what banks charge. <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">real question</span><span class="font-italic"> before me was whether the transaction in question was unconscionable or substantially unfair having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</span> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 We noted earlier (at [16] and [35] above) that the Judge rightly took the view that it did not follow from a finding of an excessive interest rate that the loan transaction in question was therefore unconscionable or substantially unfair. With this consideration in mind, coupled with the fact that the Interest Rates charged under the MWA Loan Agreement were much higher than bank interest rates, the Judge proceeded to decide what he saw as the “real question” before him, which was in fact the second limb of s 23(1) – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the MWA Loan Agreement was unconscionable or substantially unfair. With respect, this approach disregards the plain statutory language of s 23(1), which requires that there must first be a finding of an excessive interest rate under the first limb before the inquiry into the second limb is embarked upon. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">What does “excessive” mean?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In our judgment, an “excessive” interest rate for the purposes of the first limb of s 23(1) of the MLA is one that is not merely high, but rather, one that is <span class="font-italic">significantly</span> higher than what other licensed moneylenders could or would <span class="font-italic">reasonably</span> have charged a borrower in a <span class="font-italic">similar</span> situation. As Chew DJ noted in <span class="font-italic">Unilink Credit</span>, the inquiry is a “relative” one, and the particular interest rate before the court must be assessed against the interest rates charged in other <span class="font-italic">similar</span> transactions (see [30] above). The inquiry under the first limb of s 23(1) accordingly entails more than a quantitative analysis, and requires an objective assessment of the facts. In determining whether the interest rate in question is excessive, the court should consider these two essential questions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What is the interest rate that is in fact being charged?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Is this interest rate significantly higher than the interest rates that other licensed moneylenders could or would <span class="font-italic">reasonably</span> have charged a borrower in a <span class="font-italic">similar</span> situation?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Considering these two questions in the light of the facts before us, Evan Lim’s case failed at the first limb of s 23(1). As noted at [9] above, the Interest Rates charged under the MWA Loan Agreement were 5% (the base interest rate) and 8% (the default interest rate) per month; these worked out to effective interest rates of 79.59% and 151.82% per annum respectively. Undoubtedly, these interest rates were high. However, the legal question was whether they were <span class="font-italic">excessive</span>. On this point, there was simply no evidence as to what interest rates other licensed moneylenders could or would reasonably have charged the Company for a loan similar to MWA’s $10m loan to the Company in July 2014. If Ivy Lee had shopped around for a $10m loan for six months before deciding on the loan offered by MWA, evidence of what interest and default interest rates other licensed moneylenders wanted to charge the Company would have been relevant. Evan Lim did not, however, adduce any such evidence. Instead, it relied upon the interest rates charged by banks at the material time, which ranged from 0.75% per annum to 5.25% per annum (see the GD at [77]). In our view, these bank interest rates were not appropriate comparators. As MWA rightly pointed out, “the Company clearly did not have access to bank loans. If it did, it would not have made commercial sense to seek financing from a licensed moneylender such as MWA”. From the viewpoint of a licensed moneylender, unsecured borrowers pose a higher risk of defaulting, and naturally, the moneylender would charge such borrowers interest rates which are much higher than bank interest rates. To compare prevailing bank interest rates with the interest rates charged by licensed moneylenders (such as MWA) would plainly be wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Evan Lim and Shirley Ong, who were among the persons who extended loans to the Company, were not licensed moneylenders, and the interest rates charged by each of them would thus not be appropriate comparators for the Interest Rates charged by MWA. Be that as it may, it is worth nothing that the interest rates which they charged were significantly higher than bank interest rates and were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) under the First Settlement Agreement, Evan Lim charged the Company interest at the rate of 10% for two months (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 60% per annum) in return for granting the Company an additional two months to repay the accrued debt of $7,735,028 (see [4] above); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) under the agreement between the Company, Ivy Lee and Shirley Ong, Shirley Ong charged the Company interest of 32% per annum, which took the form of payment of 40% of $1.75m (the principal sum loaned) within 15 months (see [8] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Evan Lim raised two arguments in support of its contention that the Interest Rates charged by MWA were excessive. First, it argued that the loan granted by MWA was for a short term, and was secured; MWA’s risk was therefore low. Weighed against these factors, the Interest Rates were excessive. In our judgment, insofar as these considerations could be said to affect the interest rates charged by other licensed moneylenders in a similar situation, this argument had no merit given the quality of the security held by MWA. MWA’s security had to be viewed in the context of the first legal mortgage which UOB had over the D8 Property. The various forms of security which the Company subsequently granted to MWA were all subject to UOB’s mortgage. Weighing the junior ranking of the security held by MWA against the risk of the Company defaulting on repayment of the large loan of $10m extended by MWA, MWA could not be criticised for taking the view that it was entitled to charge a higher interest rate than the prevailing bank interest rates to compensate for the risk it was assuming. It bears emphasis here that the position in July 2014 was that the Company faced severe financial difficulties, and had already sought and obtained alternative (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, non-bank) sources of financing at high interest rates (see [4]–[8] above). This, coupled with its entry into a series of agreements that purported to be investment agreements but were in fact financing schemes, said much about: (a) the difficult financial straits which the Company was in at that time; (b) the constraints faced by the Company in offering security for any loans which it might be able to obtain, given that it had already charged its assets to UOB; (c) the risk proposition that the Company represented to potential lenders; and (d) the sort of “returns on investment” which the Company was willing to offer in order to obtain financing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The second argument raised by Evan Lim in support of its submission that the Interest Rates were excessive was that they far exceeded the “statutory caps on the interest rates that were previously prescribed for secured and unsecured loans”. Again, this argument was ill-founded. The statutory caps set out in the Moneylenders Rules 2009 (GN No S 72/2009) (“the MLR”) at the time the MWA Loan Agreement was entered into in July 2014 applied only to <span class="font-italic">individual borrowers</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> and not to corporate borrowers such as the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 To set the context, these statutory caps, if exceeded, would trigger the following presumption under s 23(6) of the MLA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where in any proceedings in court referred to in subsection (1) or where proof of debt has been filed as referred to in subsection (5), it is found that the interest or late interest charged on any loan exceeds such maximum rate of interest or late interest as may be prescribed for the loan, the court or the Official Assignee, as the case may be, shall presume for the purposes of this section, unless the contrary is proved, that the interest or late interest charged in respect of the loan is excessive and that the transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 At the time the MWA Loan Agreement was entered into, the applicable maximum interest rates set out in r 11(2) of the MLR for <span class="font-italic">individuals</span> were the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 13% per annum for a secured loan to an individual whose annual income was less than $30,000; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 20% per annum for an unsecured loan to an individual whose annual income was less than $30,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Notably, as the Judge observed at [52] of the GD, r 11(2) of the MLR did not provide for any caps on interest as regards business loans and loans made to individuals whose annual income exceeded $30,000. Subsequently, the MLR was amended in 2015 to expressly provide in r 12B that the statutory caps did not apply to a “business loan”, which was defined in the MLR as a loan granted to a company incorporated under the Companies Act (see r 1A of the MLR).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Against this backdrop, Evan Lim argued that the need for r 12B to expressly exclude “business loans” from the MLR in 2015 suggested that it was the understanding that the previous statutory caps in r 11(2) applied to loans to companies. In our judgment, there was no merit in this argument. The previous statutory caps under r 11(2) applied to “an <span class="font-italic">individual</span>” [emphasis added] whose annual income fell below the specified limit. In this regard, it is also instructive to note that s 23(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MLA states that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the Minister <span class="font-italic">may</span> prescribe <span class="font-italic">different</span> maximum rates of interest to apply to <span class="font-italic">different</span> classes or descriptions of borrowers or loans. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Notably, the ministerial discretion provided for in s 23(8)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was exercised in r 11(2) in relation to only a specific group of borrowers (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, individuals with an annual income of less than $30,000) with reference to two different types of loans (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, secured and unsecured loans). As such, the statutory caps in r 11(2) applied exclusively within these defined boundaries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Further, it was expressly clarified by Parliament during the second reading of the Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill (Bill 4 of 2012) in March 2012 that (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (9 March 2012) vol 88 at p 2511 (Ms Sim Ann, Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… we are extending the coverage of the interest rate caps to a larger group of borrowers, from applying only to borrowers earning less than $20,000 a year, to those earning less than $30,000 a year. … Borrowers earning $30,000 or more a year generally qualify for credit facilities, and are not dependent solely on moneylenders for credit. Thus, we have decided not to introduce any interest rate caps for them for now. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Plainly, Evan Lim’s suggestion that the statutory caps in the MLR also applied to business loans was contrary to Parliament’s intention in:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) narrowly circumscribing the class of persons who were intended to be protected through the statutory caps; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) providing different statutory caps for different types of loans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For these reasons, whilst the Interest Rates charged by MWA were high, we found that Evan Lim had failed to discharge the burden of proof which was on it to establish that these interest rates were excessive in the context of a $10m loan made by a licensed moneylender (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, MWA) to a corporate borrower which was in dire financial straits (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Company). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second limb of s 23(1): Whether the MWA Loan Agreement was unconscionable or substantially unfair </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Having found that the first limb of s 23(1) of the MLA was not satisfied, it was strictly not necessary for us to go on to deal with the second limb. Nonetheless, we make some observations on this limb since the Judge’s decision concerned it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As we stated earlier (at [28] above), Evan Lim was content to argue before us that a finding of an excessive interest or default interest rate would invariably satisfy the second limb of s 23(1) of the MLA. We have already pointed out above that this argument is contrary to the statutory language of s 23(1), which requires that the loan transaction concerned, in addition to charging an excessive interest or default interest rate, must also be “unconscionable or substantially unfair”. Given the narrow confines of Evan Lim’s contention, the parties did not specifically deal with the meaning of the terms “unconscionable” and “substantially unfair” in the statutory context, or the test for these two alternative statutory grounds in their submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Section 23(1) of the MLA does not provide a definition of the terms “unconscionable” and “substantially unfair”. The parameters of the “unconscionable” and “substantially unfair” grounds are also not prescribed in s 23(1), unlike some foreign statutory provisions which list the various factors that the court may have regard to in assessing the circumstances of the case before it and determining whether to exercise its powers of intervention. In the circumstances, the Judge’s approach in the proceedings below was to assess the MWA Loan Agreement with reference to the facts and circumstances of this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In our judgment, in order for a court to find that a loan transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair, there must at least be evidence of the commercial setting as well as the purpose and effect of the loan transaction. This can extend to conduct in the formation of the transaction (see <span class="font-italic">Carringtons, Limited v Smith</span> [1906] 1 KB 79 at 93). Further, the relevant clauses(s) of the loan transaction being challenged have to be specifically presented. There may be terms of the transaction that go beyond the legitimate commercial interests of the parties, and these may be taken into consideration in determining whether the transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In addition to considering the aforesaid matters, the court must also undertake a qualitative and objective assessment of all the other facts and circumstances of the case, including (but not limited to): (a) the circumstances leading up to the loan transaction in question (including whether independent legal advice was available to the borrower); (b) the conduct of the licensed moneylender <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the borrower, in particular, whether the borrower was in a vulnerable position and whether the licensed moneylender took grossly unfair advantage of the borrower’s financial weakness or otherwise exploited that weakness in a manner which would offend good conscience or attract moral condemnation; and (c) the terms of the transaction (including but not limited to the interest rates charged). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In this case, Evan Lim’s argument on the second limb of s 23(1) was based entirely on the Interest Rates charged by MWA under the MWA Loan Agreement. Its contention was that the risk for MWA was low as its loan to the Company was for a short-term and was secured (see [44] above). Other than the Interest Rates charged, Evan Lim did not single out any other term or aspect of the MWA Loan Agreement that it was dissatisfied with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We first consider the evidence of the commercial setting as well as the purpose and effect of the MWA Loan Agreement. At the material time in July 2014, the Company’s intent was to borrow money from a licensed moneylender in order to pay some of its debts, several of which it had already clearly defaulted on. As stated at [44] above, the Company was in dire financial straits at that time – it had already obtained at high interest rates alternative (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, non-bank) sources of financing packaged as attractive “investments” to its lenders, and needed further financing. Against this backdrop, MWA was taking a significant risk in extending a $10m loan to the Company, in that it was parting with a very significant amount of money in return for <span class="font-italic">limited</span> security and a significant prospect of default by the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Undoubtedly, as at July 2014, the Company was in urgent need of financing from a licensed moneylender. Its precarious financial circumstances made it difficult for it to obtain financing on attractive terms; indeed, it was highly unlikely that the Company could have obtained better terms of financing than those offered by MWA. The Company was vulnerable in that sense. However, mere evidence of vulnerability on the part of a borrower in and of itself is not sufficient to satisfy the second limb of s 23(1). As Keane J aptly put it in the High Court of Australia’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Paciocco v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd</span> [2016] HCA 28 (albeit in a different legal context), “[t]he existence of a disparity in bargaining power, which is an all-pervading feature of a capitalist economy, does not establish that the party which enjoys the superior power acts unconscionably by exercising it” (at [293]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Signs of gross unfairness or exploitative conduct indicative of unconscionability or substantial unfairness may be present when the negotiations leading up to the loan transaction concerned or other matters relating to the transaction are resolved in a manner that is entirely for the benefit of the licensed moneylender without any benefit at all for the borrower. This was not the case on the facts. On the contrary, there was clear evidence before us of back and forth negotiations that took place between the Company and MWA on pertinent terms of the MWA Loan Agreement such as the Interest Rates. There was no suggestion before us that all these matters were resolved in favour of MWA. Notably, Evan Lim did not complain about MWA’s conduct, nor did it point to any exploitation of the Company’s financial weakness by MWA which was such as would offend good conscience or attract moral condemnation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Further, it is unlikely that a loan would be considered substantially unfair or unconscionable where the borrower fully understands the terms of the loan (see <span class="font-italic">Reading Trust</span><span class="font-italic">, Limited v Spero </span>[1930] 1 KB 492 at 504 and 510). In this case, the Company’s sole director and shareholder, Ivy Lee, was not at all a novice to business transactions. Instead, she was a businesswoman and property developer, and she fully understood the $10m loan that she was seeking from MWA on behalf of the Company. There was no suggestion that she did not have a good grasp of what was involved under the MWA Loan Agreement before she executed that agreement on the Company’s behalf. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that prior to the grant of the loan by MWA, Ivy Lee had read and signed on the Company’s behalf a Note of Contract on 4 July 2014 which prominently highlighted the Interest Rates that were payable by the Company. Both the Company and Ivy Lee were legally represented, and they had the benefit of legal advice before entering into the MWA Loan Agreement and the other agreements which provided MWA with security in connection with its loan to the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Considering all the above factors, we had no difficulty reaching the conclusion that there was simply nothing before us to warrant a finding that the MWA Loan Agreement was “unconscionable or substantially unfair” under the second limb of s 23(1) of the MLA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal and fixed the costs of the appeal in the sum of $38,000 (inclusive of disbursements) in favour of each of the respondents to the appeal, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, MWA and the Liquidators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Separately, there was the matter of the costs of the Liquidators’ application to be joined as a party to the appeal. Only MWA was named as a respondent in the Notice of Appeal filed by Evan Lim, and the Liquidators subsequently applied either to be joined as a party to the appeal or, alternatively, for leave to make submissions at the hearing before this court. There was no question at all that the Liquidators had a right to be heard, and Evan Lim’s stance in objecting to the Liquidators being made a party to the appeal and/or being heard at the appeal was unreasonable. We therefore fixed the costs of the Liquidators’ joinder application in the sum of $10,000 and $2,000 (both inclusive of disbursements) in favour of the Liquidators and MWA respectively. We also made the usual consequential orders.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon           Belinda Ang Saw Ean      Quentin Loh<br/>Chief Justice            Judge        Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Tee Jim SC, Gan Theng Chong, Andrew Tan Jian Ming and Chua Huimin Michelle (Lee &amp; Lee) for the appellant;<br/>Teo Chun-Wei Benedict, Lim Mei Yee Elaine and Sim Yu Xuan Shane (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the first respondent; <br/>Michael Palmer and Reuben Tan Wei Jer (Quahe Woo &amp; Palmer LLC) for the second respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1          This appeal arose out of the liquidation of Ivy Lee Realty Pte Ltd (“the Company”) following the acceptance by the second respondents, the Company’s liquidators (“the Liquidators”), of the proof of debt lodged by the first respondent, MWA Capital Pte Ltd (“MWA”), for the unpaid principal and interest due under a loan agreement made between the Company and MWA on 4 July 2014 (“the MWA Loan Agreement”). The appellant, Evan Lim Industrial/Warehousing Development Pte Ltd (“Evan Lim”), a creditor of the Company, challenged the Liquidators’ acceptance of MWA’s proof of debt, contending that the interest and default interest rates charged by MWA were “excessive and unconscionable or substantially unfair” under s 23(1) of the MLA. This appeal focussed on whether Evan Lim had succeeded in proving that the requirements set out in s 23(1) were met.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The material facts</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2          In or around 2011, the Company was involved in developing a condominium (“the D8 Property”). The development project was financed by United Overseas Bank Limited (“UOB”), which held a legal mortgage over, among other things, the D8 Property. Subsequently, the development project ran into financial difficulties, and the Company borrowed money from various non-bank sources in an attempt to tide over these difficulties. Several of these loans were packaged as investments when, in reality, they were simply loans with relatively high interest rates. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3          In July 2014, the Company borrowed $10m from MWA, a licensed moneylender, to settle some of its other debts. The loan was to be repaid in full within six months. The contractual and default interest rates (collectively “the Interest Rates”) stipulated under the MWA Loan Agreement were 5% and 8% per month respectively. MWA received various forms of security for the loan, including a charge over the Company’s rights, titles and interest in the D8 Property which ranked behind that of the first legal mortgagee, UOB. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4          The Company subsequently defaulted on the MWA Loan Agreement, whereupon MWA commenced legal proceedings and obtained summary judgment against the Company for the undisputed principal sum owed under the MWA Loan Agreement. When the Company failed to make payment under the summary judgment, it was ordered to be wound up. The Liquidators then sold the D8 Property. The net proceeds of sale available for distribution to the Company’s creditors, after the redemption of UOB’s mortgage and other expenses (“the D8 Proceeds”), was lower than the Liquidators’ adjudication of MWA’s revised proof of debt as at 9 November 2015. The prospect facing the general creditors (including Evan Lim) was that the whole of the D8 Proceeds would go to MWA. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">5          The Liquidators then applied for, among other things, an order that they be authorised to repay monies to MWA as a secured creditor out of the D8 Proceeds. In response, Evan Lim filed Summons No 2281 of 2017 (“SUM 2281”) pursuant to s 315 of the Companies Act to reverse or modify the Liquidators’ decision to affirm the Interest Rates charged under the MWA Loan Agreement, contending that the Interest Rates were “excessive and unconscionable or substantially unfair” under s 23 of the MLA. The High Court dismissed SUM 2281, reasoning that Evan Lim had not established that the MWA Loan Agreement was unconscionable or substantially unfair. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The CoA’s decision</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">6          The Court of Appeal (“the CoA”) dismissed Evan Lim’s appeal against the High Court’s decision. Two main issues were decided by the CoA:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">(a)        whether Evan Lim, as an unsecured creditor of the Company, had the <em>locus standi </em>to pray in aid of the court to step in and exercise its statutory powers under s 23(1) of the MLA (“the Jurisdiction Issue”); and</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 36pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">(b)        whether, in respect of the MWA Loan Agreement, the requirements set out in s 23(1) for reopening a loan transaction were met (“the Section 23 Issue”).</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">7          On the Jurisdiction Issue, the CoA agreed with Evan Lim that it did have the <em>locus standi</em> to seek the court’s intervention under s 23(1) of the MLA even though it did not fall into any of the classes of persons identified in s 23(4) of the MLA as being eligible to seek relief under s 23(1). Under s 23(5) of the MLA, read with s 327(2) of the Companies Act, the Liquidators had the discretion to invoke s 23 of the MLA and determine whether the requirements for reopening the MWA Loan Agreement were met. Since, in this case, the Liquidators either decided not to invoke their powers pursuant to s 23(5) of the MLA or omitted to consider these powers, Evan Lim was entitled to rely on s 315 of the Companies Act to challenge their decision: at <strong>[24]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">8          On the Section 23 Issue, the CoA noted that s 23(1) </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">of the MLA contains two requirements for reopening a loan transaction which are to be read conjunctively as follows: (a) the interest or late interest charged is “excessive” (“the first limb”); and (b) the loan transaction is “unconscionable or substantially unfair” (“the second limb”). It does not invariably follow from a finding of an excessive interest rate that the loan transaction in question would therefore be considered unconscionable or substantially unfair: at <strong>[27]</strong>, <strong>[28], [31]–[32], [35]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">9          An “excessive” interest rate is one that is <em>significantly</em> higher than what other licensed moneylenders could or would <em>reasonably</em> have charged a borrower in a <em>similar</em> situation. The inquiry is a “relative” one, and the particular interest rate before the court must be assessed against the interest rates charged in similar transactions. On the facts of the case, there was simply no evidence as to what interest rates other licensed moneylenders could or would reasonably have charged the Company for a loan similar to MWA’s $10m loan to the Company in July 2014. The interest rates charged by banks were not appropriate comparators because the Company clearly did not have access to bank loans at the material time. Further, it was immaterial that the Interest Rates exceeded the statutory interest rate caps set out in the Moneylenders Rules 2009 (GN No S 72/2009) because those caps did not apply to corporate borrowers such as the Company. Evan Lim thus failed to satisfy the first limb of s 23(1) of the MLA: at <strong>[41], [42], [45], [52]</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">10        With regard to the second limb of s 23(1), the CoA noted, by way of observations, that in order for a court to find that a loan transaction is unconscionable or substantially unfair, there must at least be evidence of the commercial setting as well as the purpose and effect of the loan transaction. The court must also undertake a qualitative and objective assessment of all the other facts and circumstances of the case, including: (a) the circumstances leading up to the loan transaction (including whether independent legal advice was available to the borrower); (b) the conduct of the moneylender <em>vis-à-vis</em> the borrower, in particular, whether the borrower was in a vulnerable position and whether the moneylender took grossly unfair advantage of the borrower’s financial weakness or otherwise exploited that weakness in a manner which would offend good conscience or attract moral condemnation; and (c) the terms of the transaction (including but not limited to the interest rates charged). Considering these factors, the CoA had no difficulty reaching the conclusion that there was simply nothing on the facts of the case to warrant a finding that the MWA Loan Agreement was “unconscionable or substantially unfair”: at <strong>[56], [57], [63]</strong>.</span></p>
