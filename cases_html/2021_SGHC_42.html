In or around July 2000, the Plaintiff alleged that Mr Spackman caused Littauer Tech to acquire a company that he had established, Silverline Investment Limited, in exchange for US$1.3bn worth of stock in Littauer Tech. The Plaintiff also alleged that Mr Spackman had inflated the value of the shares of Littauer Tech and Silverline by making false and exaggerated claims. In particular, it was alleged that whilst Mr Spackman claimed that there was a large amount of foreign capital being invested into Littauer Tech, there was in fact no such investment.

</div> The exact nature of the Korean Supreme Court’s decision is a matter of some contention, but it suffices to note here the substantive result was that Mr Spackman was held liable for the above sum. There is, however, also a question of whether the Korean Supreme Court Judgment included the interest described above. In allowing the appeal by the other defendants, the Korean Supreme Court remanded their cases to the Seoul High Court, which then found that these other defendants were not liable. This decision was upheld by the Korean Supreme Court in another appeal.

</div> I deal, therefore, primarily with the Conspiracy Claims, but touch on the merits of the Enforcement Claim where relevant to the merits of the Conspiracy Claims. However, I state for the avoidance of doubt that in relation to both the Enforcement Claim and Conspiracy Claims, any discussion of the merits in this judgment is provisional and based on the evidence as it stands before trial. The actual merits of these claims are matters for the trial judge to determine after trial. I am concerned here only with whether the threshold for interim and/or <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunctions have been satisfied on the affidavit evidence presently before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable standards</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I bear the following two standards in mind as I turn to consider the merits of the Conspiracy Claims:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The standard in relation to an interim injunction is that there must be a serious issue to be tried. The threshold is a low one – all it requires is that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious: <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid</span> at 407. The court will only investigate the prospects of success to a limited extent – “[a]ll that has to be seen is whether he has prospects of success which, in substance and reality, exist” (<span class="font-italic">White Book</span> at para 29/1/12).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The standard in relation to <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunctions is a different one. There must be a good arguable case on the merits, meaning one which is “more than barely capable of serious argument, but not necessarily one which the judge considers would have a better than 50 per cent chance of success”: <span class="font-italic">Bouvier, Yves Charles Edgar</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2015] 5 SLR 558 (“<span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span>”) at [36]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The elements of the torts of unlawful and lawful means conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There is no real dispute at present as to the elements of the torts of unlawful and lawful means conspiracy. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Quah Kay Tee</span><span class="font-italic"> v Ong and Co Pte Ltd </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 637 at [45]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The tort of conspiracy comprises two types: conspiracy by unlawful means and conspiracy by lawful means. A conspiracy by unlawful means is constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the intention achieved. In a conspiracy by lawful means, there need not be an unlawful act committed by the conspirators. But there is the additional requirement of proving a “predominant purpose” by all the conspirators to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the purpose achieved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In other words, the elements of the tort are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) an agreement between two or more persons to do a certain act;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) with the intention of or for the purpose of injuring or damaging the plaintiff (if the act is unlawful) or with the predominant purpose of doing so (if the act is lawful); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the acts were done pursuant to that agreement, resulting in loss or damage to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The factual basis for the Plaintiff’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Plaintiff’s case is primarily based on inferences to be drawn from the facts concerning various transfers of SMG(HK) shares. Hence, before turning to the specific elements, I deal with the various arguments raised in relation to the inferences to be drawn. As noted above, the Plaintiff’s case centred on the inferences to be drawn from: (a) the undervalue transfers; (b) the timings of the transfers; (c) the links between PVS and Funvest, on the one hand, and Mr Spackman, on the other; and (d) the “incredible excuses” given by Mr Spackman and Mr Kim for the transfers.

</div> In my view, however, Mr Kim’s statement to that effect is not entirely probative in this context. While it may be true that characterising certain transfers as “internal” transfers may explain why the consideration for transfer was only HK$1 per share, this does not logically entail that <span class="font-italic">every subsequent transfer</span> for that same amount was also an “internal” transfer. The question of how much weight to give to the apparent “undervalue” transfers turns ultimately on the weight to be given to the explanations by the defendants for the transfers themselves. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The relationship between the entities and parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In addition to the facts of these transfers, the Plaintiff seeks to show that the entities involved were related to Mr Spackman. This would justify the finding that the entities had acted in concert to divert and conceal Mr Spackman’s assets and prevent enforcement against him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The first category of entities is made up of the BVI Companies, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, GD Enterprise, Azur, DVG and Trinity. As can be seen from the summary of the share transfers above at [54], each of these entities was a part of the chain of share transfers that ultimately led to the consolidation of shares in PVS, followed by Republic Park, and then Funvest. It is the Plaintiff’s case that the BVI Companies were essentially holding Mr Spackman’s assets, and that they were controlled by Mr Spackman through Mr Kim and Mdm Kim.

</div> I accept that there is a serious issue to be tried, as well as a good arguable case that the BVI Companies were acting either directly or indirectly under the control of Mr Spackman. This is supported by the connection that they had to Mr Spackman through Mr Kim and Mdm Kim, as well as the other factors raised by the Plaintiff in his pleadings and submissions.

It is convenient for me to deal first with the Plaintiff’s reliance of the findings of the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in the HK Judgment. I note that neither Funvest nor PVS were parties to those proceedings. It follows that the requirements of issue estoppel cannot be met, as there is no “identity between the parties to the two actions that are being compared” (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v MCST Plan No 301</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 at [14]–[15]) and I do not find that Funvest or PVS are bound by any of the findings in the HK Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I first consider Plutoray. The Plaintiff highlighted the following facts: (a) Plutoray’s registered address was the residential address of one Mr Jang Jeong Seok (“Mr Jang”); (b) Mr Jang was a director of PVS and Funvest (from 7 May 2018 to 16 December 2019); (c) one Mr Jung Yunyoung (“Mr Jung”) was the second director of Plutoray as well as company secretary of Funvest (up to 16 December 2019) and the current company secretary of Vaara; (d) Mr Jang acted suspiciously on 18 May 2020 when the letter informing Funvest of the Conspiracy Claims was served; and (e) Mr Jang was a shareholder and a director of a company, Constellation, before it was acquired by Spackman Entertainment Group Ltd (“SEGL”), a publicly-listed company in Singapore of which Mr Spackman was CEO and director.

These two sets of transfers occurred at around the time that various efforts were being made in various jurisdictions to enforce the Judgments against Mr Spackman. However, in my view, the weight to be given to this factor is rather limited, and this is only probative if there are other good reasons for inferring a conspiracy as alleged. Further, the weight to be given to these “coincidental” timings is also limited by the absence of evidence as to how long such transfers would usually take to execute. It cannot be ruled out entirely that the transfers that followed closely after certain developments in the case against Mr Spackman were already planned or arranged <span class="font-italic">before</span> those developments were made known. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As for the other transfers, I am unable to place much weight on the alleged coincidences in timing. The periods of time between when the relevant defendants became aware of the enforcement action and the transfers themselves were sufficiently long and were not uniform in each instance. For example, the Plaintiff’s contention in relation to the transfers to Republic Park in September 2019 did not make much sense given that the Plaintiff had become aware of the transfers to Plutoray in <span class="font-italic">May</span> of that year, nearly four months before the transfers in question.

As part of this partnership, Mr Kang received 300,000 SMG(HK) shares from GD Enterprise.

I also find that the fact that the transfers were for HK$1 per share to be odd in the context of enforcement of security over the shares – it is not clear to me why such payment would have to be made if these transfers were made in the enforcement of security rights. I do not find (and do not need to find) that these are “knock-out blows” in favour of the Plaintiff, but I am satisfied that they raise doubts as to the explanation provided by the relevant defendants and call for an explanation. Given the starting point of undervalue share transactions between Azur and Trinity, on the one hand, and Plutoray, on the other, the absence of a satisfactory explanation at this stage is one factor that I consider in analysing whether the Plaintiff has shown a serious issue to be tried and/or a good arguable case.

It therefore reached out to SEGL to propose an acquisition of SMG(HK) shares held by SEGL. SEGL, however, was unwilling to sell its shares as it wished to remain the largest shareholder in SMG(HK). Instead, SEGL suggested to ESA to approach other SMG(HK) shareholders to explore if they were willing to sell their shares.

However, I do not ultimately find that a good arguable case of conspiracy has been made out at this stage. Despite the different positions taken as to the existence or transfer of KRW13bn pursuant to the SPA, and Funvest’s inconsistent positions on whether this sum was received and if so, what was done with that sum, I do not find that these uncertainties are sufficiently directed to the existence of a conspiracy. While these facts, if accepted, do give rise to doubts about Funvest’s honesty and credibility, I do not find that there are any concrete links between these inconsistencies and the conspiracy itself. A mere suspicion of conspiracy arising from general dishonesty or lack of credibility, in my view, is not sufficient to make out a good arguable case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In addition, while the Plaintiff has sought to argue that ESA was acting together with Mr Spackman and SMG(HK),

</div> this is only supported by conjecture. There is no credible evidence to suggest that ESA was somehow involved with Mr Spackman in these transfers.

It is equally possible that the transfers were simply some other business dealings, however potentially disreputable. That, in my view, is the crux of the difficulty that the Plaintiff faced. While it is true that conspiracies are often only provable by inferences, the inferences must be targeted and justified, and not just one of many possibilities. The latter is speculative, and not at all the basis of a good arguable case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The fact is that shares from sellers other than the BVI Companies were involved in the Alleged Consolidation and sale to ESA as well.

The mere fact that Mr Spackman may have evaded paying his judgment debts does not mean that every commercial transaction that he (or any entity with tangential relationship with him) enters into is part of that process of evasion. In addition, the incurring of additional stamp duties which the Plaintiff emphasised may well have been necessitated by the preference that some of the sellers had for dealing with a Singapore-incorporated company, requiring the involvement of Funvest. While there were elements of the defendants’ explanations that gave rise to difficulties, I do not think that an allegation of conspiracy can be made out on those difficulties alone. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Enforcement Claim and loss for the purposes of the Conspiracy Claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 For completeness, I turn then to PVS’s argument that because the underlying Enforcement Claim could not succeed due to the limitation period expiring under s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed), no loss was actually caused to the Plaintiff if he could not enforce the Judgments in Singapore, and a crucial element of the Conspiracy Claims would not be satisfied.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87  As for the other contentions that the Enforcement Claim would fail, I find that there is a good arguable case that the Korean Judgments would be enforced in Singapore. I accept that foreign default judgments that are final and conclusive can be enforced in Singapore, as the High Court held in <span class="font-italic">Eleven </span><span class="font-italic">Gessellschaft Zur Entwicklung Und Vermaktung Von Netzwerktechonologien MBH v Boxsentry Pte Ltd</span> [2014] SGHC 210 at [79] (see also <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1322 at [77]). The Korean Judgments are clearly final and conclusive, and no further recourse can be had against them in the Korean courts. Hence, I find that a good arguable case for enforcement has been made out. Once again, I state for the avoidance of doubt that the merits of the Enforcement Claim is a matter for the trial judge to determine after trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The initial ownership of the SMG(HK) shares</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 PVS also raised an argument that no intention to cause injury (predominant or otherwise) can be shown because the Plaintiff has not proven that the SMG(HK) shares belonged to Mr Spackman.

It is not disputed that the SMG(HK) shares in question were all held by GD Enterprise prior to the series of transfers that form the basis of the present dispute. The connection between Mr Spackman and GD Enterprise alleged by the Plaintiff is based on Triolink, which was apparently acting as the entity which gave instructions to GD Enterprise’s registered agent.

</div>
</div> For completeness, I observe that as these are interlocutory proceedings, affidavits may contain hearsay evidence if the sources and grounds of the information or belief is stated (see O 41 r 5(2) of the ROC), which requirement is satisfied here. The question of whether this link can be proved <span class="font-italic">at trial</span> is a different one. Furthermore, while Mr Kim is stated to be the director and owner of GD Enterprise, I find that Mr Kim’s relationship with Mr Spackman casts some doubt on his independence as a matter of reality, given the other evidence above. In the circumstances, I find that there is a good arguable case that the SMG(HK) shares were Mr Spackman’s assets through GD Enterprise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Has the Plaintiff shown a good arguable case and/or a serious issue to be tried?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In my judgment, the Plaintiff has not shown a good arguable case that PVS and Funvest were involved in a conspiracy as alleged. A number of parties <span class="font-italic">other than PVS and the BVI Companies</span> participated in the commercial transaction in which the shares were to be consolidated and sold on to ESA. There does not appear to me to be concrete evidence of a relationship between Mr Spackman and the BVI Companies on the one hand, and PVS and Funvest on the other. The timing of the transfers also did not provide strong support for the Plaintiff’s contentions. In addition, there is no reason, in my view, to suggest that ESA was involved in any conspiracy, and if that is the case, it would also be difficult to suggest that the other entities were simply using the sale of shares to ESA as a convenient means of conducting their conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 For completeness, I also discuss the issue of intention. In order for the Plaintiff to rely on lawful means conspiracy, he has to show that there is a good arguable case that the <span class="font-italic">predominant intention</span> of PVS and Funvest was to injure him. Here, the Plaintiff faces an obstacle. The authority that the Plaintiff relied upon substantially in this case went against his argument on the predominant intention. In <span class="font-italic">JSC</span>, the claimant bank had brought an action for conspiracy against the defendants, alleging that the defendants were hiding Mr Ablyazov’s assets. As the UK Supreme Court noted at [16]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The bank does not of course contend that the defendants’ predominant purpose in hiding Mr Ablyazov’s assets was to injure it. Their predominant purpose was clearly to further Mr Ablyazov’s financial interests as they conceived them to be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The same logic applies here. PVS and Funvest were not predominantly intending to injure the Plaintiff so much as to serve Mr Spackman’s interests (assuming that the allegations are true). That would not suffice for the tort of lawful means conspiracy, and I therefore find that no good arguable case can be made on that ground.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 On the facts, I do not find that next part of the UK Supreme Court’s reasoning at [16] of <span class="font-italic">JSC</span> applies in this case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At the same time, damage to the bank was not just incidental to what they conspired to do. It was necessarily intended. The freezing order and the receivership order had been made on the application of the bank for the purpose of protecting its right of recovery in the event of the claims succeeding. The object of the conspiracy and the overt acts done pursuant to it was to prevent the bank from enforcing its judgments against Mr Ablyazov, and the benefit to him was exactly concomitant with the detriment to the bank as both defendants must have appreciated. In principle, therefore, we conclude the cause of action in conspiracy to injure the bank by unlawful means is made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In that case, the transfers were arguably in contempt of court, and the Supreme Court held that these constituted unlawful means: <span class="font-italic">JSC</span> at [16] and [24]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I am unable to find an agreement between PVS and Funvest, and the other defendants to cause injury to the Plaintiff. Given the absence of concrete evidence showing a link between PVS/Funvest and the other defendants, it is not clear to me that PVS and Funvest could be said to have the same intention in dealing with the SMG(HK) shares. I also do not find that there is a good arguable case that PVS and Funvest agreed to using <span class="font-italic">unlawful means </span>specifically. The Plaintiff relies on the following three unlawful means to cause injury, as pleaded:

There is no description of <span class="font-italic">why</span> the concealment, dissipation or disposal of assets was unlawful. That first ground is a description, rather, of the conspiracy, and the question must be why those transfers were unlawful. As for the second alleged unlawful means, the existing BVI Injunctions were targeted only at the BVI Companies. Given my views above, I am unable to conclude that PVS and Funvest either knew of the BVI Injunctions or intended to breach the BVI Injunctions and to use that as the instrumentality by which the Plaintiff was to be injured. As for the third ground, it is not entirely clear to me how these breaches of director’s duties could be established if it is true that the companies were used simply to effect the transfers in line with the conspiracy, and in any event, given my findings above, I also do not think a good arguable case can be made that PVS and Funvest intended that the transfers in breach of directors’ duties would be used to injure the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In my view, for the same reasons, no serious issue has been raised to be tried in this case. I do recognise that this is a lower standard than the requirement that there be a good arguable case which applies to <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>injunctions, but I find that the Plaintiff’s case, being largely speculative as against PVS and Funvest, does not give rise to a serious issue to be tried.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">SUM 2058/2020</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Having considered the factual background, I turn for completeness to the other requirements for the interim injunction and the <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>injunction, in relation to Funvest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The interim injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I am of the view that an interim injunction under either O 29 r 1 or O 29 r 2 of the ROC is not appropriate in these circumstances.

There is therefore no basis for such an interim injunction as that sought in Draft Order A to SUM 2058/2020 to be ordered against Funvest. Put another way, the substantive claim against Funvest would not, even if successful, entitle the Plaintiff to relief in respect of the shares and/or the traceable proceeds thereof specifically. Instead, it would entitle them to damages that can be assessed. Given the nature of the claim, which is <span class="font-italic">personal</span> and sounding in damages, it cannot be right to grant the Plaintiff a <span class="font-italic">proprietary</span> injunction at this stage in the proceedings. The only alternative to this analysis would be to treat the injunction as a <span class="font-italic">quia</span><span class="font-italic"> timet</span> injunction, but this was not advanced by the Plaintiff (and would be inconsistent with his claim that the tort had already been committed) and I say no more about this possibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I turn then to O 29 r 2 of the ROC. As this issue turns on the interpretation of O 29 r 2, I set out the relevant provisions again: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Detention, preservation, etc., of subject-matter of cause or matter (O. 29, r. 2)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.</span>—(1) On the application of any party to a cause or matter, the Court may make an order for the detention, custody or preservation of any property which is the subject-matter of the cause or matter, or as to which any question may arise therein, or for the inspection of any such property in the possession of a party to the cause or matter.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) For the purpose of enabling any order under paragraph (1) to be carried out, the Court may by the order authorise any person to enter upon any immovable property in the possession of any party to the cause or matter.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where the right of any party to a specific fund is in dispute in a cause or matter, the Court may, on the application of a party to the cause or matter, order the fund to be paid into Court or otherwise secured.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) An order under this Rule may be made on such terms, if any, as the Court thinks just.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Order 29 r 2(1) of the ROC, on a plain reading of the rule, comprises two different categories of orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An order for the detention, custody or preservation of property,</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) which is the subject-matter of the cause or matter; or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) as to which any question may arise therein; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An order for the inspection of any <span class="font-italic">such</span> property in the possession of a party to the cause or matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Based on the draft order attached to SUM 2058/2020, if one were to put the Plaintiff’s application in the language of O 29 r 2(1) of the ROC, the Plaintiff is seeking an order for the detention, custody or preservation of the property in question, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the shares in SMG(HK) and/or the sales proceeds thereof. To support this application of O 29 r 2 to the present case, the Plaintiff argued that O 29 r 2 had a wider application than simply cases of proprietary interests over the property in question, and that it extended to any property as to which a question may be raised. This included the shares and/or sales proceeds in the present case as the Conspiracy Claims involved those properties. To support this proposition, the Plaintiff cited a number of cases where O 29 r 2 or its equivalent was employed even where there was no proprietary claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In my judgment, the Plaintiff cannot rely on O 29 r 2(1) of the ROC for the injunction it seeks in the present case. I deal with the application in two parts, as it relates to the shares and as it relates to the sales proceeds thereof. Insofar as the application relates to the sales proceeds, it is clear that O 29 r 2(1) has no application – it has been held that “property” under O 29 r 2(1) of the ROC does not include <span class="font-italic">choses in action</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Bocotra</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Pte Ltd and others v Attorney-General</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 282 at [50]–[51] and <span class="font-italic">UCMI Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 95 at [27]–[28]), and it is trite that a right to monies in a bank account is a <span class="font-italic">chose in action</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman v </span><span class="font-italic">Karpnale Ltd</span> [1991] 2 AC 548 at 574; <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 at [113]). There is no suggestion that the sales proceeds referred to in this case were or are held in any other manner than as monies in a bank account. Therefore, no order can be made under O 29 r 2(1) of the ROC in respect of the sale proceeds. If the application pertains to a specific fund, the appropriate provision is under O 29 r 2(3) of the ROC, but the Plaintiff has not characterised his application as being under that provision

</div> and has not addressed the applicability of that rule. There is also a doubt, as Funvest argued, as to whether the sale proceeds in question have been intermingled. Given how the Plaintiff’s case was run, I do not deal with O 29 r 2(3) any further. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I turn then to the application as it relates to the shares. I proceed on the assumption (without coming to a conclusion) that shares may be treated as “property” under O 29 r 2(1) of the ROC. Even if I accepted that part of the Plaintiff’s contention, it seems clear to me that this was not a case where an order under O 29 r 2(1) of the ROC can be made in respect of the shares. First, I do not find that the shares in this case are the subject-matter of the claim or matter. The tortious claims against the relevant defendants in unlawful or lawful means conspiracy are focused on the agreement and actions of the defendants. That the alleged conspiracy centred around these shares in SMG(HK) does not render these shares the subject-matter of the claim or matter – apart from their provenance and alleged relationship to Mr Spackman (which are separate facts as to the history of the transactions and not one concerning the shares <span class="font-italic">themselves</span>), there is nothing specific to the shares which connects the shares to the tortious claim. I state here for avoidance of doubt that this is an exercise that needs to be undertaken on the facts of each case and I do not base my reasoning here only on the fact that the tortious claim is not a proprietary one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Second, the Plaintiff has not adequately shown how there may be a question arising in the claim or matter in relation to the shares themselves. The Plaintiff has not alleged before me that he requires the shares themselves for the purposes of establishing the Conspiracy Claims, or that some question arises in relation to the shares specifically as opposed to questions arising generally <span class="font-italic">surrounding</span> the shares and the transactions related to the shares. Put another way, it is not clear why the shares themselves would be needed as part of the suit. There is a need to “establish a sufficiently real connection between the issues in action and the property that is the subject of the application”: <span class="font-italic">UCMI </span>at [34]. The Plaintiff has not established this connection in his application before me and mere assertions to that effect are certainly not enough.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s 7th Affidavit at paras 124, 131, 139. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108  The authorities cited by the Plaintiff do not, in the final analysis, assist the Plaintiff. I deal with each of them in turn.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Revenue and Customs Commissioners and another v Ben Nevis (Holdings) Ltd and others</span> [2012] EWHC 1807 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Ben Nevis</span>”) concerned a claim under s 423 of the UK’s Insolvency Act 1986 for a fund of £7.8m which had been transferred by the first defendant to the second defendant’s bank account after the first defendant was investigated for tax evasion. The claim sought to make the fund available for partial satisfaction of a tax recovery claim. The English High Court allowed the claim under the Insolvency Act. In my view, I am unable to see how that authority is relevant here. The proposition relied upon by the Plaintiff at [71] of <span class="font-italic">Ben Nevis</span> was made <span class="font-italic">specifically</span> in relation to the relief under the Insolvency Act (UK) and does not stand for a general proposition that an injunction can be granted over specific assets in the general course of things in the absence of a proprietary claim. In any event, in that situation, it would seem that the monies may be considered a specific fund over which there is a dispute under O 29 r 2(3) of the ROC.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Unilever plc v Pearce</span> [1985] FSR 475 (“<span class="font-italic">Unilever</span>”), the English Patent Court granted an order allowing inspection of machinery in a claim for infringement of a patent, on the basis that it was property as to which a question may arise under O 29 r 2(1) of the UK Rules of the Supreme Court as was in force at the time, and was <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with O 29 r 2(1) of the ROC. However, that case is clearly different. Although the claim was not a proprietary one, the very property and the specific characteristics of the property, in that case, machinery allegedly used in the offending manufacturing process, were exactly the issues in the claim. That was in the very nature of a patent infringement claim, since the allegation was that the use of that machinery in the alleged manner was the source of at least part of the infringement: <span class="font-italic">Unilever </span>at 485. Hence, the court could conclude that the machinery in question would be “machinery or equipment (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>a physical ‘property’) as to which a question or questions may, and, indeed, almost certainly will arise in the action”: at 485. The same cannot be said of the shares in the present case, where nothing appears to turn on the specific characteristics of the shares themselves (as opposed to facts surrounding the shares which are dealt with by other sources of evidence).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Towa Corporation v ASM Technology Singapore Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] SGHCR 16, the claim was an infringement of a patent. The application concerned, <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">alia</span>, inspection of the machine by which the infringement was allegedly occasioned: at [1]. Again, that is a case where a question or questions may arise as to the property, given the centrality of specific characteristics of the property to the claim. Ultimately, the application did not succeed in that case because the High Court found that the plaintiff had failed to establish a genuine and substantial issue to be tried: at [47].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The Plaintiff’s reference to <span class="font-italic">Anton </span><span class="font-italic">Piller</span> orders (what is now known as a “search order”) is also, in my view, misplaced. First, as a matter of clarification, O 29 r 2 is not seen as the <span class="font-italic">basis</span> of the <span class="font-italic">Anton </span><span class="font-italic">Piller</span> jurisdiction. Rather, as the learned authors describe it in the <span class="font-italic">White Book</span> at para 29/3/2, the <span class="font-italic">Anton </span><span class="font-italic">Piller</span> jurisdiction “complements” the rules in O 29 rr 2 and 3. Second, the purpose of a search order is to prevent a defendant from frustrating the process of justice and to preserve the subject-matter of a claim as well as documents that may relate to the cause of action (<span class="font-italic">White Book</span> at para 29/1/6). That purpose does not apply to the shares or the sales proceeds in this case and whatever may be said about the scope of a search order does not translate to the present context. In any event, a similar inquiry has to be undertaken as to the connection of the property in question to the cause of action when a search order is considered, and for the same reasons above, I do not think the requirement would be satisfied in relation to the shares and/or sale proceeds thereof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 For these reasons, I am unable to grant the orders for an interim injunction under either O 29 r 1 or r 2 of the ROC as sought by the Plaintiff against Funvest. Given my views on the inapplicability of O 29 rr 1 and 2 in the present case, I do not go on to discuss the requirements for the court’s exercise of discretion in granting such an injunction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mareva injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Apart from the requirement of a good arguable case, the other criterion for the granting of a <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunction which Funvest disputes is the requirement of a real risk of dissipation of assets. Given how the arguments have been run in this case, the following warning from the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> at [93] and [94] bears repeating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">93 … In our judgment, if there is a unifying principle that can adequately rationalise and explain the circumstances in which a court may legitimately infer a real risk of dissipation from nothing more than a good arguable case of dishonesty, it is this – <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the alleged dishonesty must be of such a nature that it has a real and material bearing on the risk of dissipation</span>. It will be evident from our analysis of the cases that it is in such circumstances that the courts have been willing to draw the necessary inference. This is sensible because whether or not such an inference may be drawn is ultimately a question of fact. In assessing whether the inference is warranted as a matter of fact, it is appropriate, in our judgment, for the court to <span class="font-italic">segregate</span> the two questions (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether there is a good arguable case on the merits of the plaintiff’s claim and whether it has been shown that there is a real risk of dissipation) and answer them <span class="font-italic">separately</span>. We accept that the evidence relied on to answer the first question may be the same as that relied on to answer the second. But, once the inquiries are segregated, it will be clear that whether the evidence pertinent to the first stage of the inquiry is sufficient also for the purposes of the second stage is an assessment that cannot – and emphatically must not – be made mechanistically; and in that context, if an allegation of dishonesty is all that is relied on, that allegation must be such as to say enough about a real risk of dissipation in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">94 In our judgment, a well-substantiated allegation that a defendant has acted dishonestly can and often <span class="font-italic">will</span>, as we have said, be relevant to whether there is a real risk that the defendant may dissipate his assets. But, we reiterate that in each case,<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is incumbent on the court to examine the</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> precise nature of the dishonesty that is alleged and the strength of the evidence relied on in support of the allegation</span>, keeping fully in mind that the proceedings are only at an interlocutory stage and assessing, in that light, whether there is sufficient basis to find a real risk of dissipation. That alone is the justification which lies at the heart of the court’s jurisdiction to grant Mareva injunctions. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An allegation of dishonesty does not in itself form a substitute for an examination of the degree of risk of dissipation unless, as we have said, that allegation is of a nature or characteristic that sufficiently bears upon the risk of dissipation</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I acknowledge the Plaintiff’s argument that in this case, the allegations of dishonesty are not general and go towards the risk of dissipation. This is because the very nature of the conspiracy was a conspiracy to dissipate assets for Mr Spackman, suggesting that there would be a similar risk in relation to the conspirators’ own assets. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bouvier</span> was not rejecting the relevance of dishonesty to the question of a real risk of dissipation, but was clarifying only that the allegation had to “sufficiently bear[] upon the risk of dissipation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 However, given my views on the factual basis of the Plaintiff’s argument, I find that any dishonesty in this case (which gives rise to some of the doubts as to specific transfers and the ESA arrangement) is only a generalised dishonesty that does not have a direct bearing on the risk of dissipation. Further, the specific arguments raised by the Plaintiff

</div> As I do not find that a good arguable case has been made out, the Plaintiff’s case on this element of dissipation is also not satisfied.

As such, I make no findings on that in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Disclosure orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 For the same reasons as stated at [114] above, I do not make the disclosure orders sought by the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 For the above reasons, I find that there is no basis for either interim injunctions in the manner sought by the Plaintiff or <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>injunctions against Funvest or PVS. I also conclude that the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte Mareva</span> injunctions against PVS should be discharged. Given my views, I do not go on to deal with whether any distinction ought to be drawn between the merits of the enforcement of the Korean Judgments as opposed to the enforcement of the New York Judgment in the Enforcement Claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I will hear counsel on the appropriate orders to be made, costs, and any consequential applications. Parties are to provide to the Registry within three days of this judgment a common date for a half-day hearing in the week commencing 1 March 2021 for this hearing. Written submissions, limited to 10 pages (excluding exhibits, documents and case authorities) are to be filed and served three days before the hearing.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tan Puay Boon<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lin Weiqi Wendy, Leow Jiamin, Chen Chi and Tang Xi-Rui Charlotte (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Boon Hwee William, Ong Chin Kiat, Ngiam Hian San Laura (Yan Xianshan) and Tan Xeauwei (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the first defendant (watching brief);</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Joseph Tay Weiwen, Zhang Yiting, Lee I-Lin and Sheryl Tan (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the fifth defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lok Vi Ming SC, Jonathan Muk, Marie Ravindran, Aditi Ravi and Madeline Chan (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the seventh to ninth defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
