<p class="Judg-Quote-List" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt 72pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> We regret to inform you that our clients are unable to bear your client’s costs for making the application entered Summons-in-Chambers No. 5549/2003/C pursuant to Originating Summons No. 426/2003/M.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-List" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt 72pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> We would also like to add that our clients cannot be made a party to the application as there are no provisions in the Rules of Court to allow them to be made a party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In particular, Order 15 of the Rules of Court is inapplicable.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-List" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt 72pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> We have on 19 September 2003 attended with your Mr Roy Yeo at the adjourned hearing before the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck to ascertain the status of the matter and the learned judge has adjourned the matter to a date to be fixed before him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As there is no necessity for our clients to be present at the next hearing, we will not be attending the same.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-List" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt 72pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> If it is of any help at all, we have on previous occasions made applications under the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (Cap 178) for clients of ours (not DBS Bank Limited) to appoint a committee of person and estate and we had expressly asked the court for specific powers which the committee could exercise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> One such power which we have applied for and obtained is the power to operate CDP accounts and bank accounts.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-List" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt 72pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> We are of the view that there cannot be any objection to the court granting you an order in terms of your application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Such an order can be made without the need for our clients or any other party to be joined in the application.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-List" style="MARGIN: 0cm 36pt 6pt 72pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> Our clients are a reputable bank which is subject to, amongst other things, the supervision of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Accordingly, they cannot act in respect of a customer’s account other than in strict accordance with that customer’s instructions or mandate, or otherwise in accordance with an order of court.’</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> That letter carried the names of two solicitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A bank will not, in the normal course of business allow a man to operate his wife’s accounts with the bank unless a court order permits him to do so, but in this case it need only read the Order of Court dated 4 April 2003 to see that Tan Poh Sua was ordered to be made ‘Committee of the Person and Estate of Yeh Ee Swan’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If the bank does not understand the meaning and effect of that order, and it seems that it does not, then it must seek the advice of its solicitors, which it did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Unfortunately, the solicitors appeared merely to have taken instructions instead of rendering advice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I am therefore obliged to explain the effect of the order of 4 April 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That order means that Tan Poh Sua had been appointed the Committee of the Person and Estate of Yeh Ee Swan and may henceforth act on her behalf and in her stead in all her matters and affairs, and that included the right to manage and operate all her bank accounts including her accounts with the POSB bank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For the avoidance of doubt, it means that the application by way of this summons-in-chambers is unnecessary and wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> From the letter of 12 September 2003 to the solicitors of the POSB bank, the solicitor for Tan Poh Sua, Mr Roy Yeo, informed them that I was of the view that the present application was unnecessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Their response (from their letter of 25 September) was to disregard Mr Yeo entirely.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Reverting to the application, although the reasons why the general order of 4 April 2003 is adequate are obvious, I cannot, in present circumstances, take for granted that they will be readily understood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Hence, I should now go further and explain that a ‘generally worded’ order such as ‘Tan Poh Sua is appointed the Committee of the Person and Estate of the said Yeh Ee Swan’ under the Act is adequate, and that a specific order is not necessary, because –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt 72pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> The general words are intended to cover, and are clear enough to cover specific purposes such as the present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The court should not be asked to approve each and every transaction the Committee intends to carry out in discharge of its duties and functions; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-List-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt 72pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">        </span> If a customised court order is required for every specific purpose, the committee of the person will be put to unnecessary work, and the estate to unnecessary expense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Some such persons and estates are financially poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The poorer the estate the greater the need to spare it of such unnecessary expenditure.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Yeh Ee Swan, the person on whose account the application was made is caught in an utterly unfortunate position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The POSB bank refuses to let her committee discharge its function unless I grant an order specifically to that effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But for the reasons I have given above, it would be wrong in principle to grant the application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I therefore dismiss this application with written grounds in the hope that the solicitors for the bank will get it right this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If not, I can be more explicit, though not necessarily more polite.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Finally, I ought to address one more issue in regard to this application, and that concerned Mr Yeo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the originating summons he prayed for, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">inter alia</i>, ‘an inquiry to be held as to whether the abovenamed Yeh Ee Swan is or is not of unsound mind and incapable of managing herself and her affairs’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> He then prayed for an order that service on Yeh be dispensed with, and that she need not appear to attend the inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> His third and last substantive prayer was for an order that Tan Poh Sua be appointed the Committee of the Person and Estate of the said Yeh Ee Swan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the judge who heard the originating summons granted an ‘order in terms’ she clearly did not intend that the order of court be extracted verbatim because prayer one would be granted only for the inquiry to proceed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The court’s third order implicitly meant that the subject Yeh Ee Swan had been found to be mentally incompetent and incapable of managing her affairs – otherwise the third order would not have been made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Thus, Mr Yeo ought to have added a prayer after prayer 1 to the effect that the court do find the said Yeh Ee Swan to be of unsound mind and incapable of managing herself and her affairs.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Decision" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The application is, accordingly, dismissed.</span></p>
