I find that this was a Single-Income Marriage nonetheless. A marriage may still be classified as Single-Income even if the homemaker spouse worked for some time in a long marriage; what matters is the qualitative assessment of the roles played by the spouses relative to each other (<span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN </span>at [52]). As such, it was not material that the Wife might have been an employee of [X] Pte Ltd on record. As the Husband acknowledged, she ceased working at [X] Pte Ltd in 2002. After 2002, the Husband deposed that she “did not do any work” in the company and “was not entitled to any salary”.

</div> The fact that “salary” payments were made to the Wife during the marriage did not detract from my finding that she was in actuality a homemaker and that this was qualitatively a Single-Income Marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Indeed, the facts in this case are similar to those in <span class="font-italic">Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 659 (“<span class="font-italic">Yow Mee Lan</span>”), which was classified as a long Single-Income Marriage by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>at [51] and discussed in <span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN </span>at [51] and [52]. In <span class="font-italic">Yow Mee Lan</span>, the marriage stretched over 26 years and the wife worked continuously during the marriage, first for third parties and subsequently for the husband himself. The wife was working from the time of the marriage, but stopped work intermittently to care for the couple’s first and second child. She was the main caregiver throughout, as the husband travelled for work and was the main income-earner. The wife “played a supporting role in the family business owned by the husband” and “did not have either the knowledge or the talent which the husband did and could not herself have produced the substantial income he was able to generate” (<span class="font-italic">Yow Mee Lan </span>at [42] and [46]). The High Court in <span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN</span> considered a marriage such as this, where there was a clear demarcation of responsibility under which the husband focused entirely on his business with success and the wife supported him by running the household, to be a Single-Income Marriage (at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Here, although the Wife worked as a beautician and carried out some freelance work for a few years and performed administrative work for [X] Pte Ltd during the marriage, the following facts tilted the balance towards a finding that she was the primary homemaker in the marriage and that there was a clear demarcation of responsibilities between the couple:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, after stopping work as a beautician in 1995, the Wife no longer had a stable form of independent employment, first working as a freelancer and then supporting the couple’s business in [X] Pte Ltd through administrative and invoicing work carried out on a part-time basis (two to three hours a day for two to three days a week).

</div> While I acknowledge that he sought to balance between his work and family responsibilities, this does not change the fact that his primary focus was on building his businesses and that his substantial contribution to the family was through his breadwinning role in running the company that brought the family wealth. Relative to this role, the Wife was the main homemaker.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appropriate division ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Following from my finding that this was a long Single-Income Marriage, the law as articulated in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>at [46] requires that I do not apply the<span class="font-italic"> ANJ v ANK </span>approach. In long Single-Income Marriages, the courts tend towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>at [48]). The trends in cases of long marriages with children similarly incline towards equal division (<span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN </span>at [66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As I observed in <span class="font-italic">UTS v UTT </span>[2019] SGHCF 8 at [26], this approach has been applied in a number of cases, like <span class="font-italic">UMU v UMT and another appeal </span>[2019] 3 SLR 504 (involving a 22-year marriage where the wife worked a number of years drawing a relatively low income; she received 45% of the assets) and <span class="font-italic">UKA v UKB </span>[2018] 4 SLR 779 (involving a 28-year marriage with four children, where the husband similarly built and ran the company that was the source of the family’s wealth; the High Court found that the marriage was an equal partnership of different efforts and ordered equal division). The court may, however, depart from an equal distribution where the asset pool is exceptionally large: see the comments in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>at [52] that rationalised the 65:35 distribution in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin </span><span class="font-italic">v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1157 in favour of the husband on the basis that the exceptionally large size of the asset pool (amounting to around $69m) was a major factor in the court’s analysis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the present case, the division of assets should similarly tend towards an equal distribution between the parties. The Wife was the primary caregiver of the children with the assistance of a domestic helper, and it was through her homemaking contributions that the Husband could focus on building [X] Pte Ltd and his other companies. But I note the relatively large size of the asset pool. Furthermore, [X] Pte Ltd, which was started during the marriage, was responsible for most of the asset enhancement through the Husband’s efforts and accounts for slightly over half of the asset pool. At the same time, the evidence showed that the Wife provided funds to [X] Pte Ltd from her own accounts during the initial periods, even though the Husband claimed to have subsequently reimbursed her.

After deducting the assets held by the Wife (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $14,960,356.77, see above at [45]), $384,006.27 (being $15,344,363.05 - $14,960,356.77) remains payable to the Wife.

In making the relevant logistical orders, the High Court was concerned that the parties’ acrimony would cause the value of their dental practice as a going concern to be progressively reduced, the longer a decision on its future remained in doubt (at [49]). In contrast, the Wife here has not been involved in the running of [X] Pte Ltd and the divorce and any acrimony between Husband and Wife are unlikely to pose any problems to the operation of the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Furthermore, while the Wife is concerned that her shares in [X] Pte Ltd are not freely transferable and would not be easily sold in the open market,
