It pertains to a guarantee entered into between IMC Transworld Pte Ltd (the “claimant”) and Ashapura Minechem Limited (the “defendant”). Pursuant to the guarantee, the defendant agreed to guarantee various payment obligations of Al Rock Mining FZE (the “Charterer”) to the claimant under a Contract of Affreightment (the “CoA”). Disputes under the CoA led the claimant to commence arbitration proceedings in London against the Charterer, which culminated in a series of arbitration awards in favour of the claimant. Following the Charterer's failure to satisfy these awards, the claimant now seeks recovery from the defendant under the guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After the hearing on 6 October 2023, I granted summary judgment in favour of the claimant.

</div> In my view, the Guarantee operated as an “on demand” guarantee. Clause 1 of the Guarantee could not be clearer – it provides that the defendant “irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee” in the capacity of the “primary obligor and not as surety only” to guarantee the performance by the Charterer of all the obligations on the part of the Charterer (cl 1(i)) and that the defendant undertakes to make payment upon demand of “each and every sum of money which the Charterers have agreed or are liable, or from time to time become liable, to pay to the Owners under the Charter party,” and which the Charterer “have failed to pay when due” (cl 1(ii)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 An arguable case may be made that the wording of cl 1(ii) suggests that it merely operated in the form of a simple guarantee given that the defendant’s obligation to pay appeared to be <span class="font-italic">contingent</span> on sums for which the Charterer “have failed to pay when due”. Even if cl 1 may operate as a simple guarantee, this did not preclude the operation of cl 2 as a separately enforceable “on demand” guarantee by the defendant. Clause 2 provides that the defendant has undertaken a “separate and independent stipulation” as “primary obligor and not as surety only” to “irrevocably and unconditionally agree” to “indemnify the [claimant] <span class="font-italic">on demand</span>” [emphasis added]. These factors pointed to the conclusion that the defendant’s obligation to pay under cl 2 was a primary one to make payment <span class="font-italic">on demand</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> which was not co-extensive with the Charterer’s liability – as principal debtor – such co-extensiveness of liability being otherwise consistent with a simple guarantee. The defendant’s liability under the Guarantee was <span class="font-italic">not</span> contingent on the Charterer’s default of the underlying obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I did not agree with the defendant’s objection that the term “primary obligor” does not have the effect of an indemnity (or “on demand” guarantee) and that the defendant is therefore not liable as principal debtor.

</div> In taking this position, the defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Jaya</span>. In <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya</span>, the Court of Appeal found (at [57]) that the overall effect of the guarantee in that case was not an indemnity, nor did it make the guarantors liable as principal debtors. This was because “the [g]uarantee was replete with the words ‘[g]uarantor’ and ‘guarantee’”, with the words “primary obligor” being used only once in the guarantee. Furthermore, the words “indemnity” and “indemnify” did not appear in that guarantee at all. As the Court of Appeal acknowledged in <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya</span> (at [52]), citing James O’Donovan &amp; John Phillips,<span class="font-italic"> The Modern Contract of Guarantee</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, English Ed, 2003) at para 1-101, that the dominant view (which the court found applied on the facts of <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya</span>) is that “primary obligor” clauses does “not convert what would otherwise be interpreted as a contract of guarantee into a contract of indemnity”, it accepted that ultimately, whether a contract provides for an indemnity is a “matter of construction in each case [involving a ‘principal debtor’ clause] whether a guarantee or an indemnity has been given”: see Low Kee Yang, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Guarantees in Singapore and Malaysia</span> (LexisNexis Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 32. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my view, the facts of <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya</span> were distinguishable. Unlike in <span class="font-italic">PT Jaya</span>, the term “primary obligor” is referenced in both cll 1 and 2, with the defendant being stipulated to have assumed this obligation “irrevocably and unconditionally” in both instances where this term is used. Moreover, cl 2 expressly provides that the defendant “irrevocably and unconditionally agree[s] to <span class="font-italic">indemnify</span> the Owners on demand and keep the Owners <span class="font-italic">indemnified</span> against all costs, expenses and liabilities incurred by the Owners” which may arise “as a result of any breach or non-performance by the Charterers of any of Charterers’ obligations under or pursuant to the Charter party” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Moving beyond cll 1 and 2 of the Guarantee, the presence of cl 4, which is what is known as a conclusive evidence clause, was another factor pointing in favour of the Guarantee being construed as an “on demand” guarantee. Clause 4 provides that the defendant “shall make payment of any and all sums demanded” within three business days after the date of the claimant’s written demand for payment, and such written demand shall be “conclusive evidence of the amount due for all purposes” under the Guarantee. Such payment is to be made “without set-off or counterclaim, free and clear of any deduction, withholding, bank charges, fees or any other costs/expenses”.

</div> I did not accept the defendant’s objection that cl 4 of the Guarantee does not provide conclusive evidence of the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">liability</span> under the Guarantee.

</div> Clause 4 provides that the defendant “shall make payment of <span class="font-italic">any and all sums demanded by the [claimant]</span> under this Guarantee” [emphasis added]. No distinction is drawn between sums which were, <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> due owing and sums which are <span class="font-italic">expressed</span> to be due and owing. From the plain wording of cl 4, what mattered was that payment was required of “any and all sums demanded” by the claimant. While I was alive to the objection that cl 4 states that the “written demand shall be conclusive evidence of the <span class="font-italic">amount due</span> for all purposes under this Guarantee” [emphasis added], this did not necessarily mean that such a demand was conclusive <span class="font-italic">only</span> in relation to the quantum of the defendant’s liability. It could <span class="font-italic">also</span> extend to the defendant’s liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In reaching this conclusion, I was guided by the decision of Sir Jeremy Cooke in <span class="font-italic">Bitumen Invest AS v Richmond Mercantile Ltd FZC </span>[2016] EWHC 2957 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span>”). In that case, the claimant, the owner of a vessel, entered into a contract titled “Deed of Guarantee” with the defendant, the parent company of the bareboat charterer of the vessel, for the defendant to guarantee the performance of the bareboat charterer’s payment obligations to the claimant. The claimant applied for summary judgment against the defendant in respect of sums alleged to be due under a deed of guarantee. The relevant clauses of the deed provided, among other things (see <span class="font-italic">Bitumen </span>at [19]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A] In consideration of the Owners entering into the Charter with the Charterers and delivering the vessel thereunder, and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and adequacy of which the Guarantor hereby acknowledges) the Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the due and proper performance of all obligations, including payment obligations, which the Charterers incur or may incur towards the Owners under the Charter (the ‘Guaranteed Obligations’) and to pay to the Owners on demand all monies as may fall due from the Charterers to the Owners and to discharge all Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof when the same become due for payment or discharge.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[C] The Guarantor expressly undertakes to make payment on demand of any amount certified by Owners by written notice to be due to the Owners as a consequence of the Charterers not having fulfilled their obligations under the Charter, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of written notice for payment from the Owners.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[D] Any payments under this Guarantee shall be made in full, free and clear of any deductions, withholdings, set-offs or counterclaims of any nature whatsoever …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In granting summary judgment to the claimant, Sir Jeremy Cooke held that the “key feature of the Deed of Guarantee appear[ed] in paragraph C” of the clause, as the “trigger for payment is the issue of a demand by the Owners for an amount certified by them, by written notice, as due as a consequence of [the principal debtor] failing to fulfil its obligations under the Charter”: see <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span> at [22]. Most crucially for our present purposes, Sir Jeremy Cooke found that the “certification of any amount as due as a consequence of non-fulfilment of [the principal debtor’s] obligations must go, inevitably, to liability since, otherwise, the certification of sums as due is meaningless”: see <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span> at [23]. Having found as such, Sir Jeremy Cooke concluded that “the clear objective intention of the instrument is that payment should be triggered upon certification in accordance with paragraph C and that there should be no room for defence to such a certification by reason of the terms of paragraph D, absent fraud”. Once the defendant received the demand in accordance with paragraph C, they became liable to pay the certified sums without any deductions: see <span class="font-italic">Bitumen</span> at [26].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Likewise, <span class="font-italic">Dobbs v National Bank of Australasia</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd</span> (1935) 53 CLR 643 is also instructive. There, the High Court of Australia was confronted with a clause which provided that “a certificate signed by the Manager … stating the balance of principal and interest due to you by the customer, shall be conclusive evidence of the indebtedness at such date of the customer to you”. The court found that this clause provides that the certificate could provide conclusive evidence as to not merely the quantum of the liability but also the existence of the liability itself. In the words of the majority (at 651):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">It is not easy to see how the amount can be certified unless the certifier forms some conclusion as to what items ought to be taken into account, and such a conclusion goes to the existence of the indebtedness. </span>Perhaps such a clause should not be interpreted as covering all grounds which go to the validity of a debt; for instance, illegality … But the <span class="font-italic">manifest </span><span class="font-italic">object of the clause was to provide a ready means of establishing the existence and amount of the guaranteed debt</span> and avoiding an inquiry upon legal evidence into the debits going to make up the indebtedness. The clause means what it says, …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For completeness, I noted that counsel for the defendant sought to persuade me with the submission that the parties did not intend for the Guarantee to operate “on demand”. This could be seen from the claimant’s conduct where it had only demanded against the defendant in 2013, almost ten years after the claimant’s “long-drawn arbitration” with the Charterer. In doing so, the defendant was essentially attempting to rely on the parties' subsequent conduct in the interpretation of the Guarantee. I was not persuaded that this would detract from my conclusion that the wording of the Guarantee is such that it operates as an “on demand” guarantee rather than a simple guarantee. In any case, as the Court of Appeal emphasised in its recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim Siau Hing @ Lim Kim Hoe and another v Compass Consulting Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2023] SGCA 39 at [96], “it remains an open question whether evidence of subsequent conduct may be admitted for the purposes of contractual interpretation”. As the question did not arise for the Court of Appeal’s determination on the facts, it declined to express its views on the admissibility of subsequent conduct in contractual interpretation cases. In the present case, I did not think that subsequent conduct should be admitted to support the defendant’s interpretation of the Guarantee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 From the above analysis, I found that the Guarantee operated an “on demand” guarantee (or an indemnity) such that the defendant was liable upon the claimant’s demand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I turn next to address the defendant’s submission that a triable issue arose over the scope of the Guarantee, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, whether the Guarantee covered only the <span class="font-italic">existing</span> liabilities of the Charterer that were enforceable against the Charterer and not liabilities of the Charterer that have ceased to exist.

Given that the Charterer was incorporated in the UAE and that, on the facts, there was no indication that the Charterer had any assets or presence in Singapore, it was questionable why the Charterer chose to seek to enforce the Arbitration Awards in Singapore without seeking enforcement of the same in the UAE. If the court were to find that the claimant’s failure to disclose the information of the existence or presence of the Charterer in Singapore was deliberate, this may be grounds to set aside the Enforcement Order for being contrary to public policy arising from the claimant’s opportunistic use of the procedure of the Singapore courts to seek an advantage in enforcing the Guarantee against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Finally, the defendant submitted that even in the absence of a specific triable issue, there are other reasons why the matter should go to trial: <span class="font-italic">Akfel</span><span class="font-italic"> Commodities Turkey Holding Anonim Sirketi v Townsend, Adam</span> [2019] 2 SLR 412 at [30].
