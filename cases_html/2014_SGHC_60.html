<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The respondent in this Criminal Revision was
                    charged with four charges (DAC 31609 of 2013 to DAC 31612 of 2013) for offences
                    under the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed) (“CA”).
                    Proceedings with respect to these four charges are currently underway before the
                    State Courts. The respondent is currently on bail, and his matter is scheduled
                    for a Pre-Trial Conference on 28 March 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The applicant brings this Criminal Revision,
                    however, to “amend two convictions” recorded against the
                    respondent in 2012. For the purpose of this judgment, when I use the term
                    “amend convictions” I refer to the process of setting aside a
                    recorded conviction, framing an altered charge, and subsequently convicting the
                    individual on the altered charge. I will discuss the complexities inherent in
                    such a process below at [4]. In 2012, the respondent pleaded guilty to two
                    charges of “[o]ffences in relation to possession, storage, conveying and
                    harbouring of goods” under s 128I of the CA. These were charges DAC
                    33656/2012 and DAC 33689/2012. I set out the charges below to show the exact
                    amendment sought. The first charge, DAC 33656/2012, read:</p>

                        paragraph 3 of Goods and Services Tax (Application of Legislation Relating
                        to Customs &amp; Excise Duties) Order (Cap 117A, Order 4) and paragraph 2 of
                        the Goods and Services (Application of Customs Act) (Provisions on Trials,
                        Proceedings, Offences and Penalties ) Order (Cap 117A, Order 5), committed
                        an offence under section 128I(b) of the Customs Act punishable under section
                        128L(2) of the same Act. [<em>sic</em>]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The respondent should have been charged under
                        s 128I(1)(<em>b</em>), but the offence in the
                    charge was framed instead as s 128I(b). The Customs Act that was in force
                    at the time the offence was committed, 14 September 2012, labelled the
                    offence as s 128I(1)(<em>b</em>). The applicant seeks
                    to amend these previous convictions so that the respondent will be liable for
                    the enhanced punishment prescribed in s 128L(5) if convicted on any of the
                    present four charges which he faces. I dismiss the application for the reasons
                    which I shall subsequently elaborate on. I first highlight the procedure behind
                    Criminal Revision before discussing relevant cases on “amending
                    convictions”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The relevant statutory provision for Criminal
                    Revision is found in s 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
                    2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). As the convictions sought to be revised in
                    this case involved charges that were laid after 31 August 2012, the 2012
                    Revised Edition is the relevant edition of the Criminal Procedure Code that the
                    court should be concerned with. Section 401 reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Powers of High Court on
                            revision</b>

<p class="Judg-1">By s 401(2), the High Court may exercise the powers given by
                    s 390 of the CPC during Criminal Revision. Of relevance to this
                    application, the applicant asks this court to invoke three of its powers under
                    s 390. These are</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_i"></a>(i)     first, to set aside the
                        respondent’s two 2012 convictions, notwithstanding that they arose
                        from pleas of guilty, which is provided for in s 390(3)(<em>a</em>) of the CPC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     second, to frame two altered charges that
                        correspond to DAC 33656/2012 and DAC 33689/2012, with the
                        exception that “section 128I(b)” is changed to “section
                            128I(1)(<em>b</em>)” in either charge, which
                        is provided for in section 390(4) of the CPC; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     third, to <em>convict</em> the respondent on both altered
                    charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It will be obvious that a leap between the
                    applications in [4(ii)] and [4(iii)] was being attempted here. Although this
                    court is indeed empowered to set aside previous convictions and frame altered
                    charges, when altered charges are framed, the court <em>must</em> ask the respondent if he intends to offer a defence, as
                    required under s 390(6). It is only where the respondent indicates that he
                    does not intend to offer a defence, and if the court finds that there is
                    sufficient evidence based on the records before it to convict, that the court
                    can convict the respondent on the altered charges (see s 390(8)(<em>a</em>)). Another option available, after setting aside the
                    previous conviction and framing the altered charges, is for the court to order
                    the respondent to be tried on the altered charges (see s 390(8)(<em>b</em>)). Of course, complexities might arise should the
                    respondent indicate that he wishes to offer a defence (see s 390(7)). As
                    such, while the errors made in the framing of the charges in DAC 33656/2012
                    and DAC 33689/2012 may have been “technical” in nature, the
                    process of “amending convictions” in Criminal Revision is far from
                    a merely technical exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       To illustrate, should I wish to allow the
                    application in this case, the respondent would be entitled to offer a defence.
                    If he indicates that he wishes to do so, this Criminal Revision may lead to a
                    full trial. It is not simply a case of “tweaking” the
                    respondent’s criminal record.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       For clarity, I also wish to point out that once
                    an accused person has been convicted on a charge, the charge is spent. In such
                    cases where convictions have been recorded against an individual, the only
                    procedure open to the High Court on Criminal Revision is what I have stated in
                    [3] and [4]. It is practically and doctrinally impossible for the High Court to
                    simply amend the charges from which the convictions arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Having discussed the complexities inherent in
                    the process of “amending convictions”, I come now to two recent
                    decisions on point. These are <em>Bhavashbhai s/o Baboobhai v
                        PP</em> [2014] SGHC 46 (“<em>Bhavashbhai</em>”) and <em>PP v Shaik Alaudeen
                        s/o Hasan Bashar</em> [2013] 2 SLR 538 (“<em>Shaik</em>”). Both cases involved applications to
                    amend previous convictions. In <em>Bhavashbhai</em>, the
                    application was brought by the accused. When he brought his application before
                    me, he was facing ongoing proceedings in relation to a charge for consumption of
                    a specified drug. In parlance familiar to the courts and parties in criminal
                    proceedings alike, he was facing an “LT-2” charge.
                    “LT” stands for “Long Term”. If convicted, he faced
                    a minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment (see Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) s 33A(2)). An LT-2 conviction can only
                    be recorded if the court is satisfied that the accused had, on record, a
                    previous “LT-1” conviction. In <em>Bhavashbhai</em>, the applicant applied to the court to set aside
                    – or amend – the LT-1 conviction he had on his criminal record, in a
                    bid to escape conviction on the LT-2 charge he faced at the time of application.
                    Counsel argued that the underlying LT-1 conviction should have been set aside,
                    or amended, because it was erroneous. An LT-1 conviction can be recorded if the
                    accused had, on record, not less than one previous admission to a drug
                    rehabilitation centre and one previous conviction for consumption of a <em>specified</em> drug (see MDA s 33A(1)(<em>d</em>)). Counsel for the applicant argued that the previous
                    conviction on which the LT-1 charge was premised was for consumption of a
                        <em>controlled</em> drug. On that basis, counsel for
                    the applicant sought to unravel the applicant’s history of drug
                    consumption. I held there that to allow the application would have been to allow
                    the applicant to evade justice. I hence disallowed the application to amend the
                    LT-1 conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>Shaik</em>, I dealt
                    with an application brought by the prosecution. The accused there was facing six
                    LT-1 charges in ongoing proceedings at the time of the application. In the midst
                    of the proceedings, it was discovered that one of the accused’s previous
                    convictions for consumption of morphine was worded as consumption of a <em>controlled</em> drug, when it should have been – as the
                    prosecution argued – consumption of a <em>specified</em> drug. Had I allowed the application in that case, the
                    accused would have been liable to punishment on the LT-1 scale (a minimum
                    sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment on each of the six charges) if convicted
                    in the ongoing proceedings. I held, in that case, that to amend the
                    accused’s previous conviction would have been to his prejudice, and hence
                    dismissed the application. The LT-1 charges were subsequently framed as charges
                    of consumption of controlled drugs with enhanced punishment (attracting a lower
                    minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment on each charge). The accused
                    pleaded guilty to three of the charges as part of an offer by the prosecution
                    (see <em>PP v Shaik Alaudeen s/o Hasan Bashar</em> [2013]
                    SGDC 159).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Both <em>Shaik</em> and
                        <em>Bhavashbhai</em> dealt with applications under the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“CPC 1985”). The Criminal Revision provisions in the
                    CPC 1985, namely ss 256 and 269, generally corresponded to ss 390
                    and 401(2) of the CPC. More importantly, I find that the principles enunciated
                    in the two cases continue to ring true, notwithstanding the differences in
                    wording between the provisions of the CPC 1985 and the CPC.
                    Sections 390 and 401(2) of the CPC provide the accused person a chance to
                    defend himself against a newly framed charge. A revision should not be made when
                    prejudice would be caused to the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Had the accused in <em>Bhavashbhai</em> sought to peruse his criminal records in the midst
                    of, or even prior to, his LT-2 proceedings, he would have understood that he had
                    a recorded LT-1 conviction, and was hence liable to punishment on an LT-2 scale
                    should he reoffend. Had he been troubled with the basis of the LT-1 conviction,
                    namely the word “controlled” rather than “specified”
                    in his previous conviction, he would have brought it up when convicted of the
                    LT-1 offence. He did not. It hence cannot be said that he was caught by surprise
                    when he then faced an LT-2 charge, and it cannot be said that prejudice would
                    have been caused to him by refusing to amend, or set aside, the previous LT-1
                    conviction as he knew all along – and seemingly accepted – that he
                    was liable to punishment on an LT-2 scale should he reoffend. In <em>Shaik</em>, if the accused were to peruse his criminal
                    records before his LT-1 proceedings, he would not have thought that he was
                    liable to be punished on an LT-1 scale. The LT-1 proceedings would have hence
                    come as a surprise since his records would have revealed that he did not have
                    the requisite convictions to make out an LT-1 charge. To amend his convictions
                    retrospectively would have caused him prejudice. That said, there was nothing to
                    prevent the trial judge, who dealt with the accused in <em>Shaik</em>, from recognising the previous conviction and,
                    notwithstanding that it was for consumption of a controlled – and not
                    specified – drug, impose a higher sentence on account of the
                    accused’s recidivism (albeit within the limits on sentence as mandated by
                    statute).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the present case, I dismiss the
                    prosecution’s application because I am of the view that it should not have
                    been brought and not because I find that the respondent should not now be liable
                    to enhanced punishment. I make no conclusive findings on the latter – his
                    sentence is a matter for the trial judge to decide. I need only to point out
                    that a person’s liability to enhanced punishment under the CA depends on
                    the person having been previously convicted of a “specified
                    offence” (see s 128L(5)), which is defined in s 128L(7) as
                    “an offence under section 128D, 128E, 128F, 128G, 128H, 128I, 128J or
                    128K”. In this case, the respondent has, on record, at least two
                    convictions for offences under s 128I, albeit worded in such a way that the
                    requisite “(1)” is missing. Nevertheless, should the respondent
                    have perused his criminal record prior to the ongoing proceedings for the four
                    subsequent CA offences he is facing, he would likely have been aware that he
                    would be liable to enhanced punishment under s 128L(5) should he
                    reoffend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I say this is not a case where an application
                    to amend the respondent’s previous convictions should be brought because a
                    Criminal Revision in this case may lead to the complication of an otherwise
                    simple matter. I acknowledge that the mistakes pointed out by the prosecution
                    seem to be of a technical nature. Just as the missing “(1)” was
                    highlighted as an issue with each of the 2012 charges, so too was the fact that
                    the “(b)” was not italicised – when it should have been. And
                    that an outdated version of the Criminal Procedure Code was referred to in
                    either charge. But should these matters render the corresponding 2012
                    convictions void and irrelevant for the purpose of enhanced sentencing? I think
                    not. This is a different situation from <em>Shaik</em>. It
                    is within the trial judge’s powers in the ongoing proceedings, which the
                    respondent faces, to determine whether the previous convictions should count for
                    the purpose of enhanced sentencing in the present proceedings, not least given
                    the wording of s 128L(7). If I should decide to set aside the convictions
                    and charge the respondent on reframed charges, and he should decide to offer a
                    defence, however, a disproportionate amount of resources may have to be expended
                    to resolve the matter. The application is therefore dismissed.</p>
