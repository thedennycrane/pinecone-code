<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
is an application by Mr Michael Fordham QC (“the Applicant”) for <em>ad hoc</em> admission under s 15 of the Legal
Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”). The Applicant seeks
admission to represent Mr Deepak Sharma (“Mr Sharma”) in the latter’s
application for judicial review against the decision of a Review
Committee (“RC”) constituted under s 85(6) of the LPA in respect
of his complaint to the Law Society of Singapore against two solicitors,
namely, Mr Alvin Yeo SC (“Mr Yeo SC”) and Ms Melanie Ho (“Ms Ho”).
The RC had wholly dismissed Mr Sharma’s complaint against Mr Yeo
SC and partially dismissed it against Ms Ho. By way of background, Mr Sharma’s
complaint arose in connection with several costs orders made against
his wife, Dr Susan Lim (“Dr Lim”), following the dismissal of various
applications and appeals brought by Dr Lim against the Singapore Medical
Council (“SMC”) in the course of earlier disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
entire saga concerning the disciplinary proceedings against Dr Lim
has already gone through two rounds of hearings before the Disciplinary
Committee of the SMC, which found her guilty of professional misconduct
for overcharging. Dr Lim was suspended from medical practice for
three years, censured and fined $10,000. She appealed to the High
Court but this was eventually dismissed. In the present application,
the events which occurred <em>prior</em> to
Dr Lim’s aforementioned appeal are material. It is pertinent to
note that Dr Lim had challenged certain procedural decisions of
the SMC by initiating two applications in the High Court, one of
which was subsequently withdrawn while the other made its way to
the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal ultimately dismissed Dr
Lim’s appeal in respect of the latter application with costs ordered
against her. When no agreement could be reached on the costs ordered
against Dr Lim, the SMC’s lawyers, Wong Partnership LLP (“Wong P”)
filed their bills of costs for taxation in the High Court and, upon
taxation, the costs were significantly reduced. In an ironic twist
of events, the saga continues with Dr Lim’s husband, Mr Sharma,
lodging a complaint against the SMC’s lawyers for gross overcharging
as evidenced by the significant reduction of costs on taxation,
the very same act of professional misconduct which led to his wife’s
suspension.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Apart
from the intense publicity generated by the entire episode, there are
several unusual features in this application as well as in the underlying application
for judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       First,
this is not a typical judicial review filed by a party directly aggrieved
by an administrative body’s decision. The complaint was filed not by
Dr Lim, but by her husband instead. No explanation was forthcoming
as to why the complaint was not filed by the party who is liable
to pay the costs to the SMC, <em>ie</em>,
Dr Lim. Mr Sharma purported to demonstrate his interest in the complaint
by stating that he was the “<em>co-funder</em>”
of Dr Lim’s legal fees and that he owed it to his “<em>conscience
to make this complaint</em>”. However, during the hearing
before me, he adopted the position that the complaint can be filed
by anyone without having to establish any standing. Such an unusual
application not unexpectedly raises interesting issues on Mr Sharma’s <em>locus standi</em> which I will address below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Second,
the <em>ad hoc</em> admission application
is also unusual in one very unique fact. The Applicant in his statement
in support of his application asserted that he should be admitted
“[n]otwithstanding that I do not satisfy all the requirements under
s 15” of the LPA. I note that this is the first application for <em>ad hoc</em> admission where the Applicant himself
accepted that the requirements under s 15 are not satisfied. However,
the Applicant purported to correct his statement by subsequently
filing a corrective affidavit (a) without leave of court, (b) without
explaining why he had earlier stated that he did not satisfy the
requirements under s 15, and (c) what caused him to reverse his
position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I
will return to discuss these peculiarities in due course. At this juncture,
however, it is perhaps appropriate to elaborate on the relevant background
facts in greater detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On
23 January 2014, Mr Sharma made a complaint to the Law Society under
s 85(1) of the LPA against Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho of Wong P.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In essence,
the complaint alleged that Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho were guilty of professional
misconduct in seeking grossly excessive party-and-party costs against
Dr Lim in Originating Summons No 1131 of 2010 (“OS 1131/2010”),
Originating Summons No 1252 of 2010 (“OS 1252/2010”) and Civil Appeal
No 80 of 2011 (“CA 80/2011”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> OS 1131/2010, OS 1252/2010 and
CA 80/2011 were all filed in the course of a separate set of proceedings between
Dr Lim and the SMC, which had been represented by Wong P throughout.
Those proceedings were set in motion by a complaint of overcharging
against Dr Lim in late 2007 and culminated only in June 2013 with
the High Court’s decision in <em>Lim Mey Lee Susan
v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2013] 3 SLR 900 (“<em>Susan Lim</em>”), which upheld the decision
of a Disciplinary Committee appointed by the SMC to convict Dr Lim
on 94 charges of professional misconduct. The procedural history
leading up to the decision in <em>Susan Lim</em> is
set out in detail at [3]–[23] of the judgment. For present purposes,
it is only necessary to highlight the following facts to place Mr
Sharma’s complaint in its proper context.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proceedings between the
SMC and Dr Lim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On
3 December 2007, an official of the Ministry of Health, Singapore (“MOHS”)
lodged a complaint against Dr Lim with the SMC (<em>Susan
Lim</em> at [11]). This complaint expressed MOHS’s concern
over the sums invoiced by Dr Lim for the treatment of one of her
patients and concluded that MOHS was referring the matter to the
SMC for a thorough investigation. The complaint was laid before
a Complaints Committee which, after having invited and reviewed
Dr Lim’s written explanation, made an order on 17 November 2008
that a formal inquiry be held by a Disciplinary Committee (<em>Susan Lim</em> at [12]). A Disciplinary Committee
(“the First DC”) was duly appointed to inquire into MOHS’s complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On
20 July 2009, the First DC issued a notice of inquiry to Dr Lim containing
94 charges of professional misconduct under s 45(1)(<em>d</em>)
of the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2004 Rev Ed) (<em>Susan Lim</em> at [14]). The hearing before
the First DC commenced on 28 January 2010 and, at the close of the
Prosecution’s case, counsel for Dr Lim made a submission of no case
to answer. A three-day hearing commencing on 29 July 2010 was fixed for
oral submissions but, as it turned out, the First DC recused itself
after an application was made by Dr Lim’s counsel on the basis that
the First DC had prejudged the matter (<em>Susan
Lim</em> at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequently,
the SMC proceeded to appoint a fresh Disciplinary Committee (“the
Second DC”) on 14 September 2010 (<em>Susan Lim</em> at
[15]). This prompted Dr Lim to file OS 1131/2010 and OS 1252/2010
on 1 November 2010 and 17 December 2010 respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     OS
1131/2010 was an application that the SMC had no right to use the patient’s
confidential medical records in disciplinary proceedings against Dr Lim
without the consent of the patient’s next-of-kin. However, it was later
withdrawn on 21 February 2011 after the SMC produced a letter from the
patient’s next-of-kin which permitted the use of her medical records.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> OS 1252/2010 was a judicial review
application for a quashing order against the SMC’s decision to appoint
the Second DC. This application was heard before Philip Pillai J,
who granted leave for judicial review (see <em>Lim
Mey Lee Susan v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2011] SGHC
131) but eventually dismissed the application for a quashing order
on 26 May 2011 (see <em>Lim Mey Lee Susan v Singapore
Medical Council</em> [2011] 4 SLR 156).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     CA
80/2011 was Dr Lim’s appeal against Pillai J’s decision. It was dismissed
by the Court of Appeal on 30 November 2011 with costs ordered against
her (see <em>Lim Mey Lee Susan v Singapore Medical
Council</em> [2012] 1 SLR 701).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim for costs against
Dr Lim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In
a letter dated 12 March 2012, the SMC’s solicitors (<em>ie</em>,
Wong P) sought to recover party-and-party costs against Dr Lim in
respect of OS 1131/2010, OS 1252/2010 and CA 80/2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The sums claimed were disputed and
Dr Lim’s solicitors offered a counter-proposal in their reply to Wong
P on 8 June 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Wong P did not agree to
this counter-proposal and thus proceeded to draw up three bills
of costs for taxation in respect of OS 1131/2010, OS 1252/2010 and
CA 80/2011 which totalled $1,007,009.37.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> At the taxation hearing
on 25 June 2013, the Assistant Registrar taxed off approximately
two-thirds of the total sum claimed in the three bills, allowing
the recovery of only $340,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Dissatisfied
with the outcome, Wong P applied for a review of the taxation which
was heard by Woo Bih Li J on 12 August 2013. Prior to the review
hearing, Wong P, on their own accord, reduced the total quantum
of costs sought to $720,000, which was $287,009.37 less than the
total sum of $1,007,009.37 claimed under the original bills.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The explanation given by Wong P for
this unilateral deduction at the review hearing was that its earlier
bills had not taken into account an “overlap” in work done between members
of the same team handling the SMC’s matter. In any event, Woo J did
not deviate far from the Assistant Registrar’s earlier order, allowing Wong
P to claim only a marginally higher sum of $370,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Sharma’s complaint to the
Law Society</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As
stated earlier, Mr Sharma’s complaint against Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho
was made to the Law Society on 23 January 2014. It was accompanied
by the written opinion of a Queen’s Counsel, Mr Ian Winter QC (“Mr
Winter QC”), dated 8 December 2013. Mr Sharma stated that, prior
to approaching Mr Winter QC for his opinion, he had contacted several
local Senior Counsel (“SCs”) to act for him in respect of his complaint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> However, these SCs and/or
their law firms declined to act for him. He had therefore “no choice”
but to obtain the advice of a Queen’s Counsel in deciding whether
to proceed with his complaint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In
his written opinion, Mr Winter QC concluded that there was “due cause”
to believe that Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho were <em>prima
facie</em> guilty of professional misconduct because of the
grossly excessive fees which they had claimed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Interestingly,
Mr Winter QC’s opinion also stated, in the context of setting out
the factual background to the complaint, that Mr Sharma was a third
party “co-funder” of the proceedings between his wife and the SMC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> I pause here to make the observation
that this statement gave the impression that it was intended to
address possible concerns over Mr Sharma’s ostensible lack of interest
or standing to make the complaint because he was neither a party
to the proceedings between his wife and the SMC, nor the party liable
to pay the costs. In other words, the statement appeared to be a
tacit acknowledgement by Mr Sharma – who must have conveyed his
involvement as a co-funder to Mr Winter QC – that he had to establish
some form of interest, and in this case pecuniary, in the conduct complained
of so as to make the complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The
RC was duly constituted under s 85(6) of the LPA to review the complaint
and its decision was conveyed to Mr Sharma by way of a letter dated
10 April 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> In
this letter, the RC began by noting that Mr Sharma’s complaint against
Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho could be understood as comprising two independent
limbs as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     first,
that the sums claimed by Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho were exorbitant and
demonstrative of a persistent conduct of gross overcharging as well
as improper and/or fraudulent conduct that was opportunistic, arbitrary,
unconscionable and unjustified (“Limb 1”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     second,
that the sums claimed by Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho were probably in excess
of what was billed to, or could have been billed to the SMC and
that this amounted to misconduct (“Limb 2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
RC’s letter then went on to disclose its findings. Limb 1 of the complaint
was completely dismissed against both Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho. In this
connection, the RC stated that the mere fact that the bills of costs rendered
had been taxed down significantly did not <em>per
se</em> constitute professional misconduct “in the absence
of other impropriety”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Further, the
RC also rejected a specific allegation by Mr Sharma that the effective hourly
rate claimed by Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho was excessive. This was because,
in the RC’s view, the sums claimed in the bills of costs reflected
the work of “all the solicitors involved”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> As for Limb 2 of the complaint,
it was only partially dismissed. The RC found that Mr Yeo SC was
“not involved with the preparation of the Bills of Costs and the
proceedings related thereto”; hence this head of complaint against
him was “lacking in substance”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> However, in so
far as Ms Ho was concerned, the RC referred Limb 2 of the complaint
against her for further inquiry by an Inquiry Committee under s
85(8)(<em>b</em>) of the LPA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mr Sharma’s application for
judicial review</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After
the RC had conveyed its decision, Mr Sharma considered whether to
apply for a quashing order against it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He approached
several local SCs to assist him in this connection but experienced
the same outcome as when he first sought legal assistance in respect
of his earlier complaint to the Law Society – all the SCs who had
been approached and/or their law firms declined to act for him or
provide him with a formal opinion. Therefore, Mr Sharma stated that
he was again left with “no choice” but to approach a Queen’s Counsel
who, on this occasion, turned out to be the Applicant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
Applicant rendered Mr Sharma a written opinion dated 19 June 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> It
should be pointed out here that the contents of this opinion are of
some significance because it sets out the Applicant’s views on the relevant
grounds for quashing the RC’s decision and thereby provides an insight
into the <em>issues</em> which he no doubt
anticipated would arise if such a challenge was eventually brought.
This certainly had an important bearing on the present application,
which will become clearer below. I further note that, much like
Mr Winter QC’s opinion before, the Applicant also sought to convey
that Mr Sharma had participated financially in his wife’s proceedings <em>vis-à-vis</em> the SMC by stating that Mr Sharma
was “ultimately responsible” for paying Wong P’s costs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> However, this statement is clearly
inaccurate in so far as it suggests that Mr Sharma was in fact the party <em>liable</em> to pay costs to the SMC. Certainly
at no point was Mr Sharma made the subject of the relevant costs
orders. Nevertheless, this statement reinforced the impression that,
in Mr Sharma’s own view, <em>locus standi</em> had to
be shown in order to make a complaint to the Law Society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On
26 June 2014, Mr Sharma proceeded to file Originating Summons No
593 of 2014 (“OS 593/2014”). This was an application for leave to commence
judicial review proceedings against the RC’s decision to wholly dismiss
his complaint against Mr Yeo SC and to partially dismiss his complaint
against Ms Ho. Notably, the statement which accompanied this leave
application broadly recited the same grounds for judicial review which
the Applicant had framed in his earlier opinion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Indeed, this is confirmed by
Mr Sharma, who states in an affidavit filed in this application that
“[m]y grounds for judicial review are in line with Mr Fordham Q.C.’s Analysis”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present application for
ad hoc admission</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On
the same day, the present application was also filed for the Applicant
to be admitted to practise as an advocate and solicitor on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis. Such admission was sought
for the purpose of representing Mr Sharma (a) at the hearing of
his application for leave to apply for a quashing order (<em>ie</em>, OS 593/2014) and, if such leave is
granted, (b) at the substantive hearing for the quashing order,
and (c) at any appeals or other further or related proceedings thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mr Sharma’s standing to complain
to the Law Society</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before
embarking on the analysis of whether the Applicant satisfies the
requirements in s 15 of the LPA, I wish to first deal with the rather peculiar
circumstances under which the complaint to the Law Society was made
(see [4] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The
question whether a complainant is required to establish standing when
making a complaint against an advocate and solicitor has hitherto
not been considered in our courts. This is perhaps not entirely
remarkable because to my knowledge, there has never been a complaint
filed by a “<em>stranger</em>” or more aptly
a “<em>non-party</em>” to the underlying
proceedings such as Mr Sharma. In this limited sense, it is unprecedented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
standing of Mr Sharma to seek leave to apply for judicial review against
the decision of the RC is undoubtedly an issue for determination
at the leave application. However, when I examined both Mr Sharma’s complaint
to the Law Society as well as the application before me, my impression
was that Mr Sharma recognises that he has to establish his requisite
standing to do so. His purported standing was that he was the “co-funder”
of his wife’s legal fees in her applications and appeals against
the procedural decisions of the SMC. However, no further information
or basis was provided by Mr Sharma to establish that he was indeed
the co-funder. This curious omission should be examined in the context
that Dr Lim is herself a person of very substantial means and no
explanation has been provided as to why she needed co-funding and
that she was in fact co-funded by Mr Sharma. Further, it is also
pertinent to point out that even if Mr Sharma was the co-funder,
which is capable of proof, the costs orders were nonetheless made
against Dr Lim. Mr Sharma is therefore not liable to the SMC to
pay the costs irrespective of his private arrangement, if any, either
with his wife or her lawyers. It may be relevant and necessary to examine
the standing issue from this perspective. Otherwise, it may result in
a seemingly anomalous situation where Mr Sharma is able to lodge
a complaint against the lawyers about the fees claimed by the SMC
while the lawyers acting on behalf of the SMC are unable to pursue
the costs orders against Mr Sharma.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With
these reservations in mind, I invited the parties to attend before me
for directions on the legal issues which I required assistance.
At this hearing, I directed all parties to specifically address
me on the <em>locus standi</em> issue given
the unique nature and circumstances of the leave application and
the underlying complaint. I informed the parties that <em>locus standi</em> is a relevant consideration
for the purposes of the <em>ad hoc</em> admission
application only if I am able to come to a definite landing that
Mr Sharma <em>clearly</em> has no standing
to proceed with the leave application, <em>ie</em>,
that the leave application is a non-starter. In that limited event,
it would serve no purpose to admit the Applicant to argue the underlying
leave application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It
may be useful to first set out the various positions adopted by
the parties on the standing issue and how some of their initial
positions changed in the course of the proceedings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
RC implicitly acknowledged the requirement to demonstrate standing
when it noted in its decision of 10 April 2014 that “whilst you
[<em>ie</em>, Mr Sharma] were neither a client
nor a party to the proceedings against Dr Susan Lim, you were funding
the legal expenses and the information furnished by you were legitimately
the subject matter of a complaint”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     Counsel
for the Applicant, Mr Abraham Vergis (“Mr Vergis”), initially intimated
to me at the directions hearing that Mr Sharma is indeed required
to demonstrate standing. However, upon further reflection, Mr Vergis
adopted a different position at the hearing for oral submissions.
He argued forcefully that there is no requirement for a complainant
to demonstrate standing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
Attorney-General maintained a consistent position throughout that
standing is necessary and that Mr Sharma does not satisfy the requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
Law Society’s position is somewhat interesting. Initially, it adopted
the position that there is no strict requirement to demonstrate
any particular standing and that <em>any person</em> could
lodge a complaint against an advocate and solicitor. However, in
the course of his oral submissions, probably recognising the potential
floodgate of frivolous complaints, counsel for the Law Society,
Mr Christopher Anand Daniel (“Mr Daniel”), sought to hedge his position
on <em>locus standi</em> by proposing a hybrid
position. He submitted that in respect of complaints where there
is a victim, only the victim should be able to file the complaint.
In respect of alleged professional misconduct where there is no
direct victim, the complaint against such conduct can be lodged
by <em>any person</em>. In this case, Mr
Daniel’s tentative submission is that since there is a “victim”,
only that “victim”, <em>ie</em>, Dr Lim,
could lodge the complaint regarding the costs claimed against her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Having
heard detailed submissions from all parties on the <em>locus
standi</em> issue, I have arrived at the view that it is neither
plain nor obvious at this stage whether Mr Sharma is required to
demonstrate his standing and, if so, whether he has the standing
to lodge the complaint or to file the leave application. Parties,
in particular, the Law Society, are still in the process of settling
their respective positions on the standing issue. This is understandable
from the Law Society’s perspective given the wide-reaching implications
on the legal profession. As I am strictly not required to decide this
issue definitively in the context of the <em>ad
hoc</em> admission application, it is preferable and more
appropriate for the issue to be fully explored and determined at
the hearing of the leave application. For the immediate purpose
of this application, I am satisfied that the standing issue should <em>not</em> stand in the way of my consideration
of its merits. Nonetheless, I will make some preliminary observations
on the submissions made by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The
starting reference should be the statutory regime under the LPA. Section
85 of the LPA provides, <em>inter alia</em>,
as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Complaints
against advocates and solicitors</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>85.</b>—(1) <em>Any
complaint</em> of the conduct of an advocate and solicitor
—</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    shall be made to the Society
in writing;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    shall
include a statement by the complainant —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    as
to whether, to his knowledge, any other complaint has been made
to the Society against the advocate and solicitor, by him or by
any other person, which arises from the same facts as his complaint;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   if so, setting out such particulars
of each such complaint as the Council may require and he is able
to provide; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    shall be supported by
such statutory declaration as the Council may require, except that
no statutory declaration shall be required if the complaint is made
by any public officer or any officer of the Institute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1A)  Subject
to subsection (4A), the Council [<em>ie</em>,
the Council of the Law Society] shall refer every complaint which
satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) to the Chairman of
the Inquiry Panel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    
              <em>The Council</em> may
on its own motion refer any information touching upon the conduct
of an advocate and solicitor to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    
              <em>Any Judge of
the Supreme Court</em>, <em>the Attorney-General</em> or <em>the Institute</em> [<em>ie</em>,
the Singapore Institute of Legal Education] may at any time refer
to the Society any information touching upon the conduct of an advocate
and solicitor and the Council shall —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    refer the matter to the
Chairman of the Inquiry Panel …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     What
s 85(1) of the LPA makes clear is the <em>manner</em> in
which a complaint should be made to the Law Society – the complaint
must be in writing, accompanied by a statement as to whether there
are any other complaints arising from the same facts against the
same lawyer, and supported by a statutory declaration. What is not
entirely clear, however, is <em>who</em> can
make such complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The
question posed above may be answered in one of two possible ways.
On one view, any member of the public can make a complaint regardless
of his interest in or connection to the conduct of the allegedly errant
lawyer. This appears to be supported by the wording of s 85(1) of
the LPA, given its use of the rather open-ended term “[a]ny complaint”
to invite complaints by any person and that, under s 85(1A), the
Council of the Law Society is required to refer “every complaint”
to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel so long as the requirements
under s 85(1) are satisfied. The second and more circumscribed view,
however, is that only those persons who are able to demonstrate
sufficient interest in making a complaint can properly do so because,
otherwise, the Law Society may become inundated with frivolous complaints
by persons with no interest other than being busybodies. From a
policy standpoint, such a scenario may appear undesirable since
it causes the limited resources of the Law Society to be unduly
stretched which, in turn, may delay the prosecution of more meritorious
complaints.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Mr
Vergis squarely addressed the floodgates concern by inviting the court
to examine the checks and balances inherent in the existing statutory regime
under the LPA. First, he identified the need to file a statutory declaration
to accompany the complaint under s 85(1)(<em>c</em>).
This requirement was introduced in 2008 pursuant to the Legal Profession
(Amendment) Act 2008 (Act 19 of 2008) with a view to emphasise the
seriousness of complaints against lawyers and that complainants
should take steps to ensure the accuracy of their complaints. Second,
the RC itself functions as a filter. Third, the Inquiry Committee
is empowered under s 85(18) to order the complainant to deposit
a sum not exceeding $1,000. Fourth, the Inquiry Committee can order
the complainant to pay costs under s 85(19)(<em>a</em>)
if the complaint is found to be frivolous or vexatious. Finally,
a party making a knowingly false complaint shall be guilty of an
offence under s 85(21) and be liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000.
These provisions do provide some measure of restraint against frivolous
complaints. However, given the limited impact of these measures,
they may not effectively operate as a sufficient safeguard against
complaints filed by persons who are either not directly aggrieved
by the alleged professional misconduct of the lawyer or who do not
otherwise satisfy the requisite standing. It may be apposite to bear
in mind the remarks of the Minister for Law that the sufficiency
of the existing checks and balances identified by Mr Vergis “should
be considered against the impact of disciplinary proceedings on
the lawyer’s reputation and livelihood” (see <em>Singapore
Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (26 August 2008)
vol 84 at cols 3240–3242 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)). Though
his remarks were made when introducing the amendment to require
the filing of a statutory declaration to accompany a complaint against
a lawyer, they are, in my view, equally apt for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Further,
I observe that if Mr Vergis is right that any person could file
a complaint under s 85(1), why then is there any need for sub-ss
85(2) and (3), which empower specific public institutions and office-holders
to refer information touching upon the conduct of an advocate and
solicitor to the Law Society? Such public institutions and office-holders
have an inherent interest in making such referrals when the occasion
arises. Seen in this light, it would appear odd if s 85(1) is then
regarded as conferring <em>carte blanche</em> on
any person to make a complaint even though he may have no direct interest
in doing so. In other words, the juxtaposition of s 85(1) with sub-ss (2)
and (3) tends towards the conclusion that it was unlikely that s
85(1) was intended to be of such an unqualified nature. Mr Vergis
explained that sub-ss 85(2) and (3) speak of “any information” to
the Law Society while s 85(1) refers to “[a]ny complaint”. It is
not entirely clear to me whether the difference lies in form rather
than substance since both would oblige the Law Society to look into
them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For
the reasons that follow, I am able to decide on the merits of this application
without having to reach a landing on the <em>locus
standi</em> issue, however interesting and challenging it
may be. Having said that, as I will elaborate at [57] and [84] below,
it is ultimately a question of statutory interpretation of the <em>local</em> scheme for the filing and processing
of complaints under the LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The analytical framework for <em>ad hoc</em> admissions</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present statutory framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
present statutory framework for <em>ad hoc</em> admissions
is a result of the recent round of amendments to the LPA by the
Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 3 of 2012) (“the 2012
Amendment”) that took effect from 1 April 2012. This framework comprises
ss 15(1), 15(2) and 15(6A) of the LPA, which are reproduced here
for ease of reference:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Ad
hoc admissions</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>15.</b>—(1) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Act, the court may, for the purpose of any
one case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person
who —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    holds —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    Her
Majesty’s Patent as Queen’s Counsel; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   any appointment of equivalent distinction
of any jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    does not ordinarily reside
in Singapore or Malaysia, but has come or intends to come to Singapore
for the purpose of appearing in the case; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    has
special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The
court shall not admit a person under this section in any case involving
any area of legal practice prescribed under section 10 for the purposes
of this subsection, unless the court is satisfied that there is
a special reason to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6A)  The
Chief Justice may, after consulting the Judges of the Supreme Court,
by notification published in the <em>Gazette</em>,
specify the matters that the court may consider when deciding whether
to admit a person under this section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     These
provisions in the LPA must be read together with two further pieces
of subsidiary legislation to complete the picture on our current statutory
scheme for <em>ad hoc</em> admissions. The
first is the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 (S 244/2011)
(“the Admission Rules”), which lists out the areas of legal practice
referred to in s 15(2) of the LPA above. As provided in r 32(1)
of the Admission Rules, there are three such “ring-fenced” areas
of legal practice – constitutional and administrative law, criminal
law, and family law – in respect of which a “special reason” must be
shown to exist. The second piece of subsidiary legislation is the
Legal Profession (Ad Hoc Admissions) Notification 2012 (S 132/2012)
(“the Notification”), which was issued by Chan Sek Keong CJ pursuant
to s 15(6A) of the LPA. Paragraph 3 of the Notification sets out
the following matters which the court may consider for the purpose
of deciding whether to admit a foreign senior counsel in a particular
case – (a) the nature of the factual and legal issues involved in
the case; (b) the necessity for the services of a foreign senior
counsel; (c) the availability of any local SC or other advocate
and solicitor with appropriate experience; and (d) whether, having regard
to the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to admit a foreign senior
counsel for the purpose of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Since
the current statutory framework for <em>ad hoc</em> admissions
came into effect, there have been five reported cases which are,
in chronological order, as follows: <em>Re Andrews
Geraldine Mary QC</em> [2013] 1 SLR 872 (“<em>Re Geraldine
Andrews</em>”), <em>Re Caplan Jonathan Michael
QC</em> [2013] 3 SLR 66 (“<em>Re Caplan</em>”), <em>Re Lord Goldsmith Peter Henry PC QC</em> [2013]
4 SLR 921 (“<em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em>”), <em>Re Beloff Michael Jacob QC</em> [2013] 4 SLR
849 (“<em>Re Beloff (HC)</em>”) and <em>Re Beloff Michael Jacob QC</em> [2014] 3 SLR
424 (“<em>Re Beloff (CA)</em>”). The first
four cases in this quintet were decisions of the High Court while the
fifth was handed down by the Court of Appeal. These cases have been highlighted
right at the outset here because, collectively, they contain much useful
discussion on the applicable principles for <em>ad
hoc</em> admissions under the current statutory framework,
thus regular references will be made to them in the course of this
judgment. The most recent decision of <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em>,
in particular, will be turned to shortly as it has helpfully set
out the appropriate analytical framework for approaching <em>ad hoc</em> admission applications. Before
proceeding to do so, however, I digress briefly to outline how the
current statutory regime for <em>ad hoc</em> admissions
in s 15 of the LPA has evolved from its immediate predecessor, which
was contained in s 21 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1990
Rev Ed) (“the 1990 Act”) and retained in its successor versions
until 1 April 2012 (see <em>Re Geraldine Andrews</em> at
[28]). The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate how the current
statutory framework has fundamentally shifted the analytical focus from
that which prevailed under the 1990 Act and, as a consequence, cases which
were decided under the latter statutory regime should be approached with
a degree of caution in today’s context.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevance of earlier cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     
          <em>Re Geraldine Andrews</em> was the first case
to be decided under the current statutory framework and, fittingly,
V K Rajah JA took the opportunity (at [21]–[28]) to chart how the
statutory regime for <em>ad hoc</em> admissions
in Singapore had evolved over the last half a century since its inception
in 1962 as s 7A of the Advocates and Solicitors Ordinance (Cap 188,
1955 Rev Ed). I do not intend to repeat the detailed excursus undertaken
by Rajah JA here. For present purposes, it suffices to note that the
position before the 2012 Amendment was a result of the Legal Profession
(Amendment) Act 1991 (Act 10 of 1991) (“the 1991 Amendment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Prior
to the 1991 Amendment, there was a “fairly relaxed approach which
saw most [<em>ad hoc</em> admission] applications
succeeding” (see <em>Re Beloff (HC)</em> at
[14]) because the primary consideration at the time was simply whether
the foreign senior counsel had special qualifications or experience for
the purpose of the case. It was common practice for parties then
not to object to such applications; hence the court was seldom required
to exercise its discretion against admission (see <em>Re
Geraldine Andrews</em> at [34], citing <em>Re Oliver
David Keightley </em><em>Rideal QC</em> [1992]
1 SLR(R) 961 at [8]). It is therefore unsurprising that the statutory
regime prior to the 1991 Amendment did not generate much case law.
Indeed, as Rajah JA had noted in <em>Re Geraldine Andrews</em> at
[34], over the span of 20 years from 1970 to 1990, there was only one
reported decision on the <em>ad hoc</em> admission
of foreign senior counsel which, in any event, was conspicuously
brief on its discussion of the statutory framework existing then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
1991 Amendment, however, brought about a sweeping change. It caused
the law to be “moved to an extremely restricted approach” (see <em>Re Beloff (HC)</em> at [14]) and this gradually
saw a considerable body of jurisprudence being built up on the subject.
These cases had to interpret s 21 of the 1990 Act which, as has
been mentioned, was the direct precursor to the current statutory
framework in s 15 of the LPA. Section 21 of the 1990 Act read as
follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>21.</b>—(1)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the court
may, for the purpose of any one case <em>where
the court is satisfied that it is of sufficient difficulty and complexity</em> and
having regard to the circumstances of the case, admit to practise
as an advocate and solicitor any person who —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    holds Her Majesty’s Patent
as Queen’s Counsel;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    does
not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but who has come
or intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the
case; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    has
special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The
newly introduced requirement of “sufficient difficulty and complexity”
received close treatment by the courts and, as Rajah JA noted in <em>Re Geraldine Andrews</em> at [33], it would
become “notoriously difficult to satisfy”. This had important practical
implications because, although the courts had formulated a three-stage
test for approaching <em>ad hoc</em> admission applications
under s 21 of the 1990 Act, the “sufficient difficulty and complexity”
requirement was not merely one of several factors which the court
weighed in “having regard to the circumstances of the case”. Instead, it
was effectively treated in practice as a <em>threshold</em> requirement
so that, unless the issues raised in the case for which admission
was sought were assessed as being sufficiently difficult or complex,
the application would not be acceded to (see <em>Re
Geraldine Andrews</em> at [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The
above approach, as may readily be observed, is very different from
what is contemplated by our current statutory framework. Under the current
framework, the court is directed to consider the <em>totality</em> of
the circumstances surrounding the application, having particular
regard to the four factors listed in the Notification. While the
complexity of the underlying case will no doubt still have a bearing
on the court’s final determination, it is by no means a decisive
factor which trumps all other considerations. In this connection,
I note that the Court of Appeal has pertinently observed that, in
the light of the 2012 Amendment, the suitability of <em>ad
hoc</em> admissions is now to be viewed through the prism
of “need” (see <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em> at
[42]). This fundamentally shifts the entire statutory emphasis away
from the “difficulty and complexity” of a case and so, even though
there may be some common elements between the statutory regime under
the 1990 Act and the current LPA, one must exercise caution in drawing
on principles espoused under the former for the purpose of interpreting
the latter. Rajah JA made this point clearly at [64] and [65] of <em>Re Geraldine Andrews</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he intent of the 2012 Amendment is
to give the courts greater discretion in dealing with applications
for the <em>ad hoc</em> admission of foreign senior
counsel by removing the threshold requirement that the issues in
the case must be of “sufficient difficulty and complexity” and by
easing the admission requirements for appropriate matters. … <em>It is no longer necessary to show that the issues
in the case are of “sufficient difficulty and complexity”.</em> Conversely,
even if the issues are of sufficient difficulty and complexity,
it will not necessarily follow that the application for the ad hoc
admission of foreign senior counsel will be granted. <em>The focus has now shifted from the difficulty and
complexity of the issues in the underlying case to all the matters
stated in para 3 of the Notification.</em> Difficult and complex
issues may well be competently put forward and argued by local counsel
who are available and who have the appropriate expertise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The above examination of the historical
evolution of the <em>ad hoc</em> admission scheme
amply illustrates how the present scheme has <b><em>radically
modified</em></b> the earlier criteria for admission. Of particular
relevance is the decision by Parliament to devolve to the Chief
Justice the discretion to set out the matters to be considered by
the courts in deciding each and every application for <em>ad hoc</em> admission. <em>The
four matters specified in para 3 of the Notification are now the
touchstone for the courts in assessing applications for ad hoc admission. </em><b><em>Previous cases on ad hoc admission are now only
of limited relevance. </em></b><b><em>The effect
of this sea change has not been properly appreciated by counsel opposing
the present application, who appear to be still unduly wedded to case
law based on the previous ad hoc admission scheme.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     This
underlines the point that, although a wider compass of cases than
what I have identified at [37] above have dealt with <em>ad hoc</em> admissions, these cases of an earlier
vintage may not necessarily point one in the right direction. The
discussions contained in these cases certainly cannot be divorced
from the statutory context prevailing at that time which, it is
clear, has since been radically departed from.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present analytical framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As
mentioned earlier, the Court of Appeal in <em>Re
Beloff (CA)</em> has recently set out the analytical framework
for assessing <em>ad hoc</em> admission applications
under s 15 of the LPA. This is neatly summed up at [54] of the judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The architecture of the regime may thus
be summarised in terms that <em>it requires the
court first to apply its mind to certain mandatory requirements</em>. These
are:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the
formal requirements in ss 15(1)(<em>a</em>)
and 15(1)(<em>b</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the requirement that the foreign counsel
has special qualifications and experience for the purpose of the
case; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the threshold inquiry of whether a
special reason must be shown and if so, whether it has been.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We consider these requirements mandatory
because if any of these are not met, the application for admission
must fail and the question of discretion does not arise. <em>It is only if these matters are all met that the
court must then consider the further matters specified in the Notification</em>,
and then exercise its discretion having regard to all the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added
in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The
passage above makes clear that the court’s starting point is centred
on the mandatory requirements in ss 15(1)(<em>a</em>)–(<em>c</em>) and 15(2) of the LPA. If any of these
requirements are not satisfied, then it is unnecessary to consider
the Notification factors. If, however, the analysis does reach the Notification
factors, then it should be added that there is no particular precedence
among the four enumerated factors nor do they set out a new rigid
four-stage test (see <em>Re Geraldine Andrews</em> at
[45]). Instead, these factors are in the nature of “signposts” which
direct the court towards “the ultimate question” set out in the
fourth Notification factor, namely, whether having regard to all
the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to admit the foreign
senior counsel (see <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em> at
[53]). With this framework in mind, I turn now to consider the first
set of mandatory requirements in s 15(1) of the LPA, in particular,
s 15(1)(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Applicant has “special
qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     There
was no dispute that the Applicant satisfied the formal mandatory
requirements in ss 15(1)(<em>a</em>) and
(<em>b</em>) of the LPA. He has held letters
patent as Queen’s Counsel since 2006 and is not ordinarily resident in
Singapore or Malaysia but intends to come to Singapore to represent
Mr Sharma in OS 593/2014 and further and/or related proceedings
should this application be allowed. An issue was raised, however,
as to whether or not the Applicant satisfied the further mandatory
requirement in s 15(1)(<em>c</em>). In particular,
the emphasis was on whether he had special qualifications or experience <em>for the purpose of the case</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Counsel
for the Applicant, Mr Vergis, pointed out that the underlying matter
in respect of which <em>ad hoc</em> admission
was sought concerned Mr Sharma’s judicial review proceedings against
the RC’s decision. The very nature of these proceedings clearly
called for the application of administrative law principles and
the Applicant was eminently skilled to do that. His <em>curriculum
vitae</em> showed that he has, <em>inter
alia</em>, had 24 years’ experience as a practitioner with
eight of those years as a public law Queen’s Counsel, argued some
40 public law cases in the UK Supreme Court or House of Lords alone
as well as cases in the Privy Council and the Hong Kong Court of
Final Appeal, and also written a leading textbook on judicial review
which has been cited with approval in a local case (see <em>Yeap Wai Kong v Singapore Exchange Securities Trading
Ltd</em> [2012] 3 SLR 565 at [5]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On
the other hand, counsel for the Law Society, Mr Daniel, urged this court
to approach the requirement in s 15(1)(<em>c</em>)
in a more nuanced manner. To be clear, Mr Daniel did not dispute
that the underlying judicial review proceedings clearly fell within
the general rubric of administrative law. His point, however, was
that this ought not to mask the strong <em>local</em> flavour
of the specific issues which appeared likely to arise in those proceedings.
In his submission, a closer examination of the grounds on which
the RC’s decision is sought to be challenged immediately reveals
that Mr Sharma intends to place great reliance on a combination
of local professional conduct rules, ethical principles, and procedural
rules to make good his case. Yet, there was nothing to suggest that
the Applicant had the relevant qualifications or experience to deal
with these matters. His list of accolades in the general field of
administrative law therefore rather “misses the point” as submitted
by the Law Society.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I
mention for completeness that the Attorney-General did not make any
specific submissions in respect of s 15(1)(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The
cases makes it clear that, when considering s 15(1)(<em>c</em>)
of the LPA, the court’s focus is on whether the foreign senior counsel’s
qualifications and/or experience are “<em>relevant</em>”
to the underlying issues and not on whether those issues are difficult
or complex (see <em>Re Geraldine Andrews</em> at [39]; <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em> at [56]). In establishing
whether such a linkage exists between the Applicant’s expertise
and the underlying issues, one must necessarily identify those very
issues to begin with. I find that the present case poses little
difficulty in this respect. As I alluded to earlier at [20], the central
issues arising in the underlying judicial review proceedings can readily
be gleaned from the Applicant’s written opinion dated 19 June 2014. This
is because the Applicant’s opinion sets out the specific grounds
for challenging the RC’s decision and, in so doing, crystallises
the issues for the court to consider not only at the substantive
hearing for the quashing order, but also at the leave application
stage where an arguable case or <em>prima facie</em> case
of reasonable suspicion has to be made out (see <em>Jeyaretnam
Kenneth Andrew v Attorney-General</em> [2014] 1 SLR 345 at
[5]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The local-centric nature of
the underlying issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     According
to the Applicant’s opinion, there are three grounds for review which,
in gist, are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     first,
that the RC had erred in law by reasoning that objectively, excessive
overcharging cannot constitute professional misconduct <em>per se</em> “in the absence of other impropriety”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     second,
that the RC had erred in law by rationalising the effective hourly
rate claimed by Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho on the basis of “all the solicitors
involved” when there was no certificate to claim costs for more
than two solicitors; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     third,
that the RC’s reasons for dismissing Limb 2 of the complaint against
Mr Yeo SC were unsustainable in law – since it was not the function
of the RC to make factual determinations such as Mr Yeo SC’s non-involvement
in the matters complained of – and were also without any reasonable
or proper evidential basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I
agree with Mr Daniel that each of these three grounds raises issues which
are decidedly local in nature. It is clear to me that the person advocating
to quash the RC’s decision based on these grounds will have to draw
ineluctably from a distinctly local well of legal sources and, indeed,
the Applicant’s own opinion confirms that this is precisely what
he has done. What is striking about his opinion is its constant
references to local case law and statutory instruments at each turn
which, it should be added, have no apparent connection with administrative
law. I shall elaborate upon this observation by examining each of
the three proposed grounds for review in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Beginning
with the first ground, the Applicant states in his opinion that
the RC fell into error here because it failed to recognise what
he describes as the “objective-excessiveness principle”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> According to the Applicant,
this principle prescribes that objectively excessive overcharging can
constitute professional misconduct without more; hence, it was not correct
for the RC to insist upon proof of some “other impropriety” over and
above the fact that Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho had rendered bills of costs which
were significantly taxed off. However, it is plain that this “objective-excessiveness
principle” on which the Applicant relies does not have its roots
in his particular domain of expertise, <em>viz</em>,
administrative law. Instead, it derives from an amalgamation of
local sources of law which touch on the entirely different subject
of professional ethics. That this is so appears clearly from the
Applicant’s own opinion – he identifies r 38 of the Legal Profession
(Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2010 Rev Ed) as the statutory
embodiment of this principle and, further, cites the High Court’s decision
in <em>Susan Lim</em> to support his interpretation
of this ethical rule.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The
second ground for review can be approached in much the same way
as the first. Here, the Applicant states that the RC’s error was
in failing to recognise what he labels as the “impermissible-duplication
principle”. It is argued that, under this principle, costs for getting
up and attendance in court of more than two solicitors cannot be
recovered unless the court so certifies; the RC was therefore wrong
to take into account the work of <em>all</em> the
solicitors involved in assessing the effective hourly rate billed
by Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho when no such certification had been obtained
by them. Ms Ho had explained, during the review hearing before Woo
J, that the sums claimed in the original bills were voluntarily
reduced to discount an “overlap” of work done (see [14] above).
In other words, the original bills had been put forward with the
inclusion of duplication and therein lay the breach of the “impermissible-duplication
principle”. However, it bears mention that the “impermissible-duplication
principle” does not involve any intrinsic administrative law theory.
Instead, it merely concerned a part of a larger collection of rules
which impinge upon the recovery of costs in general. And, once again,
there is no mistaking its unquestionably local origin. As local
practitioners will no doubt be familiar, the “impermissible-duplication
rule” is none other than O 59 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). Indeed, this is what the Applicant has cited
in his opinion as well. The Applicant has also coined a further
“client-liability principle” which is, in essence, the Limb 2 complaint
that was partially dismissed (see [18] above). Consistent with the
“objective-excessive principle” and the “impermissible-duplication
principle” before it, this principle has also been derived from
a local statutory source. In the Applicant’s own words, it is “provided
for in section 112(2) of the Legal Profession Act”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Finally,
as regards the third ground for review, it appears that the thrust
of the challenge here is that the RC had fundamentally misunderstood
its role. The argument, essentially, is that the RC should not have
made a determination as to Mr Yeo SC’s involvement (or lack thereof) in
the matters complained of when that was not the purpose for which
it was designed; it was not a fact-finding body. From the way in
which this third argument proceeds, it is clear that it is fundamentally
premised on a firm understanding of the RC’s role to begin with.
That, in turn, requires an intimate knowledge of the wider schema
for disciplinary proceedings as laid out in our very own LPA. This
is because the RC does not stand in isolation and thus cannot be
approached as such. The RC sits as part of a longer chain of decision-making
bodies and so its role and functions can only be properly appreciated
in the light of its relationship with these related bodies. Furthermore,
it goes without saying that a proper grasp of the local case law
interpreting the relevant LPA provisions in this context will also
be required in order to advance the necessary arguments. Finally,
one would also be expected to turn to local secondary material –
such as the Parliamentary debates preceding the creation of the
RC by the enactment of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2001
(Act 35 of 2001) (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
Debates, Official Report</em> (5 October 2001) vol 73 at cols
2195–2213) – in order to gain a better appreciation of the impetus behind
the RC’s introduction into the then existing disciplinary scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As
stated earlier, the aforementioned grounds for review will not only have
to be considered at the substantive hearing for the quashing order
but also at the leave stage (<em>ie</em>,
OS 593/2014). In this connection, it should be mentioned that there
are two further issues which the court hearing the leave application
will have to take into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The
first is one which I have already sketched in some detail above, <em>viz</em>, Mr Sharma’s <em>locus
standi</em> to apply for judicial review against the RC’s decision.
As I have suggested, this appears to raise the rather interesting issue
of who can make a complaint to the Law Society. In resolving this issue,
however, I am again left in no doubt that one’s knowledge of domestic
law necessarily comes to the fore. As I have pointed out at [29] above,
the starting point for this analysis should be s 85 of the LPA.
And as Mr Vergis’ own approach to this issue at [32] shows, that
is not the only provision which will have to be scrutinised. It
is clear that other provisions in the LPA on the relevant checks
and balances against the possibility of floodgates may well also
be brought into play.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The
remaining question to be determined at the leave application stage
is whether the RC’s decision is susceptible to judicial review.
This issue arises because the Law Society takes the position that
the RC’s decisions are not reviewable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> While
Mr Daniel stated in his written submissions that he did “not wish
to delve too deeply” into the substantive arguments on this subject
– since he recognised that the appropriate forum for raising these
arguments would be at the leave application hearing – it is clear
from the broad outline of his arguments that he principally relies
on three exclusively local sources of material.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The first is the
LPA and the disciplinary proceedings framework contained therein.
Mr Daniel points, for example, to the fact that the LPA is silent
on whether the RC’s decisions can be reviewed and also to existing
provisions such as s 96, which carve out specific avenues for a
dissatisfied complainant to further pursue his complaint. It is
argued that these aspects of the disciplinary framework, among others,
do suggest that the RC’s decisions are not reviewable. Second, Mr
Daniel also relies on certain views expressed by the Minister for Law
during the second reading of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill 2008
(Bill 16 of 2008) to show that, in enacting s 91A of the LPA, Parliament
intended to limit the judicial review of decisions made under the
LPA more generally. Finally, Mr Daniel also points to several local authorities
which he says supports the non-reviewability of the RC’s decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Let
me be clear that I am in no way endorsing the soundness of Mr Daniel’s
arguments. By canvassing his arguments in this context, I have simply
sought to show that the Law Society does not seek to establish the non-reviewability
of the RC’s decision through the quintessentially administrative
law inquiry into either the source or nature of the RC’s powers.
There therefore appears to be no need for Mr Sharma to go down that
road in arguing that the RC’s decisions are reviewable. I do not
say that the principles of administrative law are therefore completely
irrelevant. Administrative law principles are indeed relevant, but
it should be recognised that they are relevant only in so far as
they put the matter of reviewability in issue at the leave stage.
Once the court begins to address its mind to this issue, however,
administrative law principles recede into the background. This is
because it appears from the way in which the Law Society seeks to
argue its case that the inquiry will then gravitate towards an analysis
of whether Parliament intended to exclude judicial review of decisions
by the RC. Discerning Parliament’s intention in turn requires one to
look inescapably to various sources of material which, as I again
stress, are wholly local in origin. In the event that the court
determines that Parliament did not intend to exclude judicial review,
then the objection should accordingly fall away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With
these observations in mind, I return to the question at hand: does
the Applicant have special qualifications or experience <em>for the purpose of the case</em>? Evidently
not. While the Applicant is clearly well-versed in the principles
of judicial review, that does not inexorably mean that he is well-placed
to argue all kinds of judicial review proceedings. The potential
issues arising in those proceedings have to be looked at closely
and, having done so, I am in no doubt that it attracts an abundance
of local content. I have not, however, been pointed to any, much
less <em>special</em>, qualifications and/or experience
which the Applicant may have in dealing with these domestic sources
of law. Putting it bluntly, it is simply not clear what the Applicant can
bring to the table given the highly <em>local-centric</em> nature
of the issues arising at both the leave application stage and at
the substantive hearing for the quashing order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Applicant’s statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Before
moving on, I make one final point to underscore the position which
I have reached. This concerns the observation which I made in my introductory
remarks (at [5]) that the Applicant had filed a statement in support
of the present application containing the following paragraph:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Notwithstanding </em></b>
<em>that </em>
<b><em>I </em></b>
<em>do </em>
<b><em>not </em></b>
<em>satisfy all the requirements specified in section 15</em> of
the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap 161) of the Laws of Singapore,
I respectfully ask that I may be admitted as a barrister of the
High Court of the Republic of Singapore to appear on behalf of Deepak
Sharma.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     This
amply shows that, <em>by the Applicant’s own candid
assessment</em>, he did not meet all the necessary requirements
to be admitted under s 15 of the LPA (which is mistakenly referred
to as the Legal Practitioners Ordinance above). While it is true
that the Applicant may not have explicitly identified subsection
(1)(<em>c</em>) as the requirement that was
unsatisfied, I do not see how he could possibly have been referring
to anything else when this statement was made. The Applicant clearly
had no difficulties satisfying the formal mandatory requirements
in ss 15(1)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>).
He was obviously referring to satisfying requirements under s 15
which are personal to him. He could not possibly be referring to
the remaining issues raised by the “special reason” requirement
in s 15(2) and the factors in the Notification since these are matters
which are not for the Applicant to satisfy and were in fact dealt
with in a separate affidavit affirmed by Mr Sharma in support of
the same application. I am further fortified in my view that the
Applicant must have had s 15(1)(<em>c</em>)
in his contemplation because a procedural practice has developed
whereby the foreign senior counsel seeking <em>ad
hoc</em> admission will typically make an affidavit affirming
those matters within his personal knowledge, and this will particularly
involve him having to state whether he can expertly discharge his
duties in the case at hand. The following observation by Rajah JA
in <em>Re Caplan</em> at [22] appears to
be the genesis for this practice:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>ad hoc</em> admission
applications, solicitors should confine the contents of the affidavits
that they affirm to: (a) the names of the parties and brief particulars of
the case in which the foreign senior counsel concerned intends to
appear (see s 15(3) of the current LPA); (b) a summary of the material
facts; (c) specific reference to the legal and factual issues involved
in the underlying case that are said to justify the admission of
a foreign senior counsel … ; and (d) facts that are within their
personal knowledge. <em>When it comes to facts
not within a solicitor’s personal knowledge, the appropriate person
to affirm the affidavit would be the person who has personal knowledge
of those facts. Thus, when it comes to, for example, the efforts
made by a client in seeking an appropriate local counsel before
he engaged a solicitor to make an ad hoc admission application,
it should be the client, and not the solicitor, who affirms those
efforts in an affidavit, since the solicitor would have no personal knowledge
of what transpired before he came on board. In a similar vein</em>,<b><em>when it comes to the applicant’s “special qualifications
or experience for the purpose of the case” pursuant to s 15(1)(c)
of the current LPA, it is preferably the applicant, and not the
solicitor or the client, who affirms this in an affidavit. In particular,
for the purposes of an ad hoc admission application, the foreign
senior counsel in question should also expressly confirm in his affidavit
that he has considered the application and all the relevant material in
relation to the underlying proceedings, and that he is able to expertly discharge
his duties.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added
in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Accordingly,
I have no doubt that the Applicant must have been addressing his
mind to the specific requirement in s 15(1)(<em>c</em>)
when his statement was made. The contents of his statement could
only have related to matters within his own personal knowledge and
that quite clearly does not extend beyond the requirements in ss 15(1)(<em>a</em>)–(<em>c</em>).
When this is coupled with my earlier observation that the Applicant
had no difficulties satisfying the formal mandatory requirements
in sub-ss (1)(<em>a)</em> and (1)(<em>b</em>), one can fairly surmise that the Applicant
must have specifically identified and concluded that sub-s (1)(<em>c</em>) was a hurdle to his application. This, however,
leaves the possibility that the Applicant may have simply made a careless <em>mistake</em> in stating that he did not fulfil
all the requirements in s 15 when he actually meant to say that
he did. I am not convinced of this. This is because the presence
of the word “notwithstanding” at the beginning of his statement
(see [61] above) could not have been a typographical error which
was inserted unthinkingly. The Applicant was clearly acknowledging through
his statement that he did not satisfy all the requirements in s
15 of the LPA but was <em>nevertheless</em> hoping
to obtain special dispensation from the court to be so admitted.
The Applicant has not, in any event, suggested that the first statement
was mistakenly made. All things considered, then, it appears safe
to say that my conclusion in respect of 15(1)(<em>c</em>)
is well aligned with that of the Applicant himself. The Applicant’s
assessment that he did not satisfy <em>all</em> the
requirements under s 15 of the LPA is, after all, in line with his
own opinion that the three grounds of review are all local-centric in
nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I
mention, for completeness, that the Applicant did file a second statement
with amendments to his first. The relevant portion is extracted here
as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<del>Notwithstanding
that</del> I do <del>not</del> satisfy
all the requirements specified in section 15 of the Legal <del>Practitioners Ordinance </del><u>Profession Act</u> (Cap 161) of the Laws of
Singapore, I respectfully ask that I may be admitted as <u>an advocate and solicitor </u><del>barrister</del> of the <del>High </del><u>Supreme</u> Court
of the Republic of Singapore to appear on behalf of Deepak Sharma.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[strikethrough and underline in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It
is clear that the overall effect of these amendments, significantly, was
to convey the exact opposite of what the Applicant’s first statement stated.
It appears that, now, the Applicant <em>did</em> satisfy
all the requirements under s 15 of the LPA. However, this second
statement was not without its problems. As has already been mentioned,
this second statement was filed without leave of court just two
days before the hearing. The filing of the second statement was
also not brought to the court’s attention by Mr Vergis during the
hearing. This procedural irregularity (the filing of the second statement
without leave) was instead raised by Mr Daniel during his oral submissions.
There was, in any event, no explanation provided whatsoever for
the obvious change in position or why the Applicant had earlier
stated that the requirements under s 15 were not met. These aspects
of the second statement were clearly unsatisfactory and thus I was
not minded to take it into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether there is a “special
reason”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Having
found that the Applicant does not satisfy the <em>mandatory</em> requirement
in s 15(1)(<em>c</em>) of the LPA, there
is strictly no need to continue with the analysis. Nevertheless,
I shall proceed to do so in the event that I am mistaken. In this
part of the judgment, I consider whether there is a “special reason”
to admit the Applicant pursuant to s 15(2) of the LPA read with
r 32(1) of the Admission Rules. This issue arises because there
is no dispute that the Applicant is seeking to be admitted for a
case falling within one of the three statutorily ring-fenced areas
of legal practice, <em>viz</em>, administrative
law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Before
setting out the parties’ respective arguments, it is useful to begin
with several propositions concerning the “special reason” requirement
which have emerged from the recent decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     First,
it is clear that the term “special reason” is one that is incapable of
precise definition. In fact, it is neither necessary nor desirable
to attempt to define it. This point was well made by Rajah JA in <em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em> at [48]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It would be something of a contradiction
in terms to attempt to identify a prototypical “special reason”.
If it is something which one can reach for and define, it is also
unlikely to be so out of the ordinary that it becomes a “special reason”.
Any attempt to define “special reason” would require an exercise
of the imagination to reach beyond issues or situations that one
normally encounters. That is not generally the practice of common
law courts, which are better equipped to develop the law incrementally
and by reference to the specific facts and circumstances of each
case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The
focus is therefore on the particular circumstances of each case and
this leads to the second point about the “special reason” requirement
– those circumstances must be <em>exceptional</em> in
nature (see <em>Re Caplan</em> at [54]; <em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em> at [48]). In this regard,
Rajah JA has further clarified that there is no sound policy reason
to confine what can constitute exceptional circumstances only to
those cases which raise “macro” considerations (<em>ie</em>, considerations
which transcended the specifics of any individual case) (see <em>Re Caplan</em> at [54]). While that is likely
to be the norm in practice, a case could well manifest exceptionality
even though only the private interests of an individual, or issues
pertaining solely to him, are involved (see <em>Re Caplan</em> at
[54]; <em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em> at [46]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The
two propositions mentioned thus far have been concerned with the
“special reason” requirement standing on its own. The third, however, has
to do with its place within the broader analytical framework for <em>ad hoc</em> admissions. It is noted that there
was, at one point, a preference for an approach known as the “twin
key” approach which regarded the “special reason” requirement as
one of two keys (see <em>Re Caplan</em> at
[48]; <em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em> at [40]).
The other key represented the composite list of factors in para
3 of the Notification and both had to be turned successfully in
order to unlock the door to <em>ad hoc</em> admission.
Importantly, the “twin key” approach did not prescribe a sequence
for turning the keys. However, it should be clear from the analytical
framework set out at [44] above that the Court of Appeal in <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em> has since taken a slightly
different view. In this regard, the Court of Appeal has unambiguously
stated (at [50]) that the “special reason” requirement is in the
nature of a mandatory <em>threshold</em> requirement
that “must be met <em>before</em> turning
to the other considerations” [emphasis added]. Nevertheless, it
should be stressed that the fact that the “special reason” requirement
and the Notification factors now clearly occupy distinct stages
of the overall inquiry does not mean that they are <em>entirely</em> separate
and distinct from one another – they are still <em>linked</em>.
The court must, accordingly, “have regard to the individual considerations
in the context of how they relate to or affect one another” (see <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em> at [55]). Putting it in
another way, one must avoid viewing the “special reason” requirement
and the Notification factors in their individual silos. Such an
approach necessarily overlooks their possible interactions with
one another and thus might lead to an impoverished analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The
main thrust of Mr Vergis’ case was that Mr Sharma had taken conscientious
steps to contact no less than 20 local SCs to assist him in either
his complaint to the Law Society or his judicial review application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> However, all
of these SCs who were approached declined to render Mr Sharma an
opinion, much less represent him for various reasons including possible
conflict of interest. In Mr Vergis’ submission, the practical realities of
this case could not be ignored as an important factor which contributed to
the lukewarm responses received by Mr Sharma. Mr Yeo SC, it was stressed,
is not only a prominent member of the legal fraternity but also
of the wider public community. He is a Member of Parliament, a very
senior local SC, and a leading figure in one of the largest law
firms in Singapore (<em>ie</em>, Wong P);
hence, he and his firm would have close professional and personal
relationships with many of the leading lawyers and law practices
in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Mr
Vergis also added that it was necessary for Mr Sharma to have skilled
representation by a local SC (or foreign equivalent) in this case because
the three grounds on which judicial review were sought raised “serious
matters”, although this was not elaborated upon in his written submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Further, he
emphasised that this was the first time that a decision of the RC
was being subjected to judicial review, thus the question of whether
the RC’s decisions were even reviewable was a novel one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Both
the Attorney-General and the Law Society proceeded on broadly the
same footing that representation by a local SC or a foreign senior counsel
was <em>not necessary</em>. In response to
Mr Vergis’ argument on the reviewability of the RC’s decision, the
Law Society’s position was that this did not raise a novel point
of law because, for the same reasons as enumerated at [58] above,
the legislature has already evinced an intention to exclude the
RC’s decisions from judicial review.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> The
Attorney-General’s submission on this point was that the novelty
of an issue in itself does not translate into the <em>need</em> for
representation by only a select pool of local SCs or foreign senior
counsel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The complexity
and difficulty of the issues involved also had to be weighed in
the balance. In this respect, both the Attorney-General and the
Law Society submitted that there was nothing to suggest that the
issues raised by the judicial review proceedings were so complex
or difficult that <em>other</em> local counsel
(<em>ie</em>, non-SCs) would not be able to
effectively represent Mr Sharma. Therefore, Mr Sharma could not
cite the lack of availability of local SCs as a “special reason”
for <em>ad hoc</em> admission when there
was no basis for him to have restricted his search to <em>only</em> local SCs to begin with. There was
a wider pool of competent local counsel from whom he could have
sought assistance but, as it turned out, omitted to consider entirely.
Moreover, there was also no explanation why Mr Vergis himself could
not adequately represent Mr Sharma in his judicial review application
given the competence which he displayed in the conduct of this application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Two preliminary observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I
make two preliminary points regarding the parties’ submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     First,
it may readily be noticed that Mr Vergis’ submission essentially populates
the “special reason” requirement with several of the Notification factors.
The lack of availability of local counsel, nature of the underlying issues,
and necessity for representation by foreign senior counsel are all factors
which have been specifically enumerated in para 3 of the Notification
(see [36] above). However, in the light of the Court of Appeal’s observation
in <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em> that the inquiry
into “special reason” is sequentially prior to and distinct from
a consideration of the Notification factors, one might pause to
query whether merging the analysis in this way is permissible. In
my view, there is nothing objectionable <em>per
se</em> with such an approach. As has already been pointed
out, the Court of Appeal has impressed the importance of recognising
that the different parts of the <em>ad hoc</em> admission
framework are necessarily linked and not standalone requirements.
Therefore, one can ordinarily expect “some degree of overlap” between
the Notification factors and the “special reason” requirement (see <em>Re Caplan</em> at [49]). Indeed, I add that
it would be unsound to insist on a “special reason” which is invariably
different from the factors found in the Notification because that
is akin to defining the “special reason” <em>by
exclusion</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Second,
it is also apparent that the crux of the parties’ dispute concerns
the relevant pool of local counsel which Mr Sharma could reasonably
have been expected to approach. Should he have approached only local <em>SCs</em> or was this too exclusive a pool?
The answer to this question cannot be answered in a vacuum. This
is because the pool of competent local counsel necessarily turns
on a prior evaluation of the nature of the issues. The more the
issues are complex or difficult, or novel, or of significant precedential
value, “the smaller might be the pool of local advocates able and
available to deal with the case at hand and the greater might be
the need for the admission of foreign counsel” (see <em>Re
Beloff (CA)</em> at [61]). With this in mind, I shall first
consider Mr Vergis’ submission on the nature of the issues raised
in the underlying proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The nature of the issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As
earlier noted in the context of discussing s 15(1)(<em>c</em>)
of the LPA, the central issues potentially arising in the underlying
judicial review proceedings are entwined with the three grounds
on which the RC’s decision is sought to be quashed (see [51] above).
Quite apart from the fact that these issues are local-centric in
nature, I also find that there is nothing particularly difficult
or complex about them. However, before proceeding to illustrate
how I came to this view, I pause to emphasise that I should not be
mistaken as attributing determinative weight to or even prioritising
the relative complexity or difficulty of a case in every application
for <em>ad hoc</em> admission. Such an approach
harkens back to the position prior to the 2012 Amendment and that
would be most unfortunate given how the jurisprudence has since
then wisely recognised the new emphasis under the current framework
(see [42]–[43] above) and, consequently, developed along its own
path. I stress that the complexity and difficulty of the underlying
issues have <em>only</em> been accorded the
attention which it has here because it is Mr Sharma’s case that
a “special reason” exists on account of the lack of availability
of local counsel to assist him in his judicial review application
and that, as I have said in the preceding paragraph, is an inquiry that
is inextricably dependent on the nature of the issues. Put simply,
the “special reason” cited in support for this application has the
effect of driving the analysis unavoidably towards an examination
of the nature of the issues. The following observations which I
make on the complexity and difficulty of the issues must therefore
be understood with this important caveat in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The
first of the proposed grounds for review rests solely on the proposition
that objectively gross overcharging can constitute professional misconduct
in and of itself. However, I do not see how it will require any intricate
or sophisticated submissions to establish this. During the hearing, I
quizzed Mr Vergis on the legal foundation for this proposition and
he was able to immediately direct me to the decision in <em>Susan Lim</em> where the court had stated,
in the context of considering a lawyer’s ethical duties at [51], that
“the presence of … additional factors is unnecessary, and … overcharging
can – in and of itself – constitute professional misconduct”. To
be clear, I am not saying that the RC’s decision should be quashed
in the light of this authority. The point which I am merely making
is that the legal proposition sought to be established does not
appear to be a particularly controversial one which, for example,
has to be extracted from a long line of (perhaps conflicting) authorities.
Further, Mr Vergis has demonstrated that he is well-acquainted with
this proposition and more than capable of advancing it in the judicial
review proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The
second ground for review also raises the rather straightforward issue
of whether the RC was correct to take into account the work of all
the solicitors involved when no certificate for more than two solicitors
had been obtained by Wong P. It should be stressed that there are
no factual disputes here. It is clear from the face of each of the
three bills which were rendered that, indeed, no certificate for
more than two solicitors had been issued. The only issue raised
by this ground is one of law – was the RC correct to take into account
the work of <em>all</em> the solicitors involved notwithstanding
the procedural rule in O 59 r 19? Again, I fail to see how the resolution
of this issue can attract much difficulty. It ostensibly turns on the
application of a particular provision of the Rules of Court, and
that is precisely the kind of question which arises in our courts
every day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The
third ground engages the legal issue of whether the RC had fundamentally
misunderstood its own role in finding that Mr Yeo SC was not involved
in the matters complained of. As I had stated earlier at [55], the
arguments made pursuant to this ground will necessarily revolve around
the relevant provisions in the LPA which set out the entire scheme for
disciplinary proceedings against lawyers. This will primarily involve
an exercise in statutory interpretation to ascertain the true role
of the RC and, once more, I am not convinced that it will either
be complex or difficult to undertake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Viewed
in this way, it is not apparent how the three grounds for review
would raise any “serious matters” as stated in Mr Vergis’ written submissions.
However, I note that, during the hearing, Mr Vergis did submit that
an important <em>threshold</em> legal issue
was raised by the three grounds collectively. The context in which
this submission was made is important. It bears mention that this
was not a point raised in either Mr Vergis’ written submissions
or in the Applicant’s opinion. Instead, it arose out of a preliminary
observation made in the Attorney-General’s written submissions to
the effect that Mr Sharma’s application for judicial review was,
for all intents and purposes, an <em>appeal</em> against
the RC’s decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> In this
regard, the Attorney-General had pointed out that none of the three grounds
raised by Mr Sharma were based on the traditionally recognised grounds
for seeking judicial review, <em>viz</em>,
irrationality, illegality, or procedural impropriety. Rather, the
three grounds were all premised on alleged <em>errors
of law</em> committed by the RC and these were properly the grounds
for an appeal. The Attorney-General therefore concluded that the judicial
review application was “fundamentally misconceived” and “doomed
to fail”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> It was
in response to this threshold argument that Mr Vergis then cited
the House of Lords’ decision in <em>Anisminic Ltd
v Foreign Compensation Commission and another</em> [1969]
2 AC 147 (“<em>Anisminic</em>”) at the hearing.
According to Mr Vergis, <em>Anisminic</em> stood
for the proposition that a tribunal’s errors or misdirection of
law <em>can</em> indeed form the basis for judicial
review; hence, the threshold question of whether or not errors of law
were even reviewable in Singapore was not as straightforward as
the Attorney-General had suggested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The
account which has just been provided illustrates how the threshold
question arose rather organically during the course of the hearing.
It was certainly not advanced as the main trunk of or even an incidental
branch to Mr Vergis’ submissions on the nature of the issues which
would potentially arise in the judicial review proceedings. Indeed,
it was not even identified by Mr Vergis or the Applicant as an issue
to begin with. Given this background context, it was unsurprising
that, apart from citing the decision in <em>Anisminic</em>,
Mr Vergis did not really develop his argument much further on how
the threshold issue was one that was <em>complex
or difficult</em>. All he could say in this connection was
that the fact that the Attorney-General took a diametrically opposed
position on such a fundamental point of administrative law lent
weight to his view that this was a difficult issue with potentially
wide-reaching implications. However, I do not think that such a
general assertion takes Mr Vergis very far. The fact that parties
may adopt clashing views on certain issues is merely a product of
our adversarial process and it does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that
those disputed issues are difficult or complex. Furthermore, I should point
out that, in any event, Mr Daniel was able to direct me to several
local authorities during the course of his oral submissions which
appear to have considered <em>Anisminic</em>.
In the light of this, it is difficult to see why local counsel will
not be able to make submissions on the threshold issue competently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Finally,
I address the two remaining issues which will arise at the leave stage, <em>viz</em>, the <em>locus standi</em> of
Mr Sharma to commence judicial review proceedings and the reviewability
of the RC’s decision. Both these issues are, in a sense, novel.
The question of whether a complainant to the Law Society is required
to establish <em>locus standi</em> has not
been considered before and this is also the first time that judicial
review has been sought against an RC’s decision. Mr Vergis therefore
says that the resolution of these issues will be of some moment
and so the court which has to decide on these important matters
would certainly benefit from the expert presentation by skilled
counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I
am not persuaded by Mr Vergis’ argument. While the novelty of the underlying
issues is no doubt a relevant factor to consider, it is simply a
part of the court’s overall assessment of the nature of the issues
involved. This is illustrated by the approach taken in <em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em>. There, Rajah JA also
recognised at [64] that the issue in respect of which the applicant sought <em>ad hoc</em> admission was a novel one – it
was the first time that the constitutionality of s 377A of the Penal
Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) was being challenged in the Court of
Appeal. In fact, Rajah JA further noted that there was “an additional
element of novelty” because that was one of the few occasions where
the court was being invited to examine the legitimacy of Parliament’s
objective in enacting s 377A. However, the application to admit
Lord Peter Goldsmith QC was dismissed because, ultimately, the issues
were not “of such a peculiarly complex nature that they present[ed]
a case which [was] out of the ordinary from a legal perspective”
(at [64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In
my view, there is also nothing “peculiarly complex” or “out of the ordinary”
about either the <em>locus standi</em> issue
or the reviewability issue here. This is because the resolution
of both issues involves no more than the proper interpretation to
be placed on the relevant provisions in the LPA pertaining, in particular,
to the complaints regime in s 85 and the disciplinary proceedings
regime in Part VII. In other words, stripped down to its core, the
two issues are essentially issues of statutory interpretation of the
relevant <em>local</em> legislation. They
might not admit of an easy answer because of the varying possible
interpretations that the respective statutory regimes can bear;
however, that is not to say that counsel will necessarily find it
difficult or complex to formulate and advance their respective interpretations
in this connection. I would also add that, in terms of novelty,
complexity and difficulty, one can easily appreciate at a glance
that the issues arising in the underlying judicial review proceedings
here certainly pale in comparison to those which were being considered
in <em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em>. I am not saying
that the present issues are trifling in nature but, as a matter
of relativity, there is plainly no doubt that a decision on whether
or not s 377A of the Penal Code is constitutional has far wider societal
and legal implications for Singapore than what concerns us here. Seen
from this perspective, it would be odd if the present application
for <em>ad hoc</em> admission nevertheless
succeeded merely because of the novelty of the underlying issues
when the application in <em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em> did
not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     There
is one final point which, in my view, cannot be ignored in the context
of considering whether it is <em>necessary</em> to
admit foreign senior counsel on account of the nature of the issues.
This point also emerges from <em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em>.
There, Rajah JA had perceptively noted that the applicant was seeking <em>ad hoc</em> admission to argue an <em>appeal</em> in the Court of Appeal. In the
learned judge’s assessment, appellate advocacy in Singapore had
become more “<em>writing-centred</em>” than
in many other common law court systems (at [29]) and he explained
the impact which this had on the necessity for <em>ad
hoc</em> admission as follows (at [37]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The writing process therefore serves both
a creative function in generating and marshalling ideas, and a critical
function that allows counsel to identify ambiguities and inconsistencies
in their own cases as well as those in the opposing side. <b><em>There is nothing to prevent the participation of
foreign senior counsel in the preparation of the written submissions,
the writing of further submissions (if any), and the preparation
of the oral case (in anticipating and preparing for questions).</em></b> Because
of the wider scope for the involvement of the expertise of a foreign
senior counsel in appeal cases, there may thus be <em>less
necessity</em> in appeals, notwithstanding the importance
of the issues engaged, to have foreign senior counsel admitted to <em>orally</em> present the Case. <b><em>It is
strong written advocacy that usually has determinative consequences.</em></b> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis
added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In
my judgment, Rajah JA’s observations are highly instructive for
the present case. Although the Applicant here does not seek admission
to argue an appeal, the underlying judicial review proceedings are
nevertheless akin to one since they are devoid of any disputes of
fact and are centred entirely on issues of law. Unlike a trial,
there will be no cross-examination of witnesses, no forensic examination
of bundles of documentary evidence, and certainly no necessity to
make “irreversible strategic decisions in the context of a dynamic
process” (see [<em>Re Lord Goldsmith</em> at
[25]). In these circumstances, it is difficult to see why there
is a need for Mr Sharma to be represented by foreign senior counsel.
The Applicant can provide substantial input in crafting and drafting
the written submissions and these arguments can then be ventilated
orally in court by competent local counsel. Mr Sharma may well <em>prefer</em> to have the Applicant argue his
case as well, but that is quite beside the point. As the Court of
Appeal stated in <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em> at
[62]: “‘Necessity’, or ‘need’, contemplates a somewhat high threshold,
higher at any rate than a matter of ‘desirability’ or ‘preference’.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relevant pool of local counsel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Having
established that Mr Sharma’s judicial review application does not
attract complex or difficult issues, it follows that the relevant
pool of local counsel which he should have approached is substantially
enlarged. I therefore agree with the Attorney-General and the Law
Society’s submissions that Mr Sharma should not have confined his
search for legal assistance to only the handful of local SCs. I
note, however, that Mr Vergis sought to address this point during
the hearing by emphasising that, in some instances, it was not just
individual SCs who had <em>personally</em> declined to
represent Mr Sharma but that <em>whole </em><em>firms</em> were doing so. The result of this
was that many local non-SCs in these firms who might have been approached
were taken out of the picture in one fell swoop. Accordingly, Mr
Vergis stressed that it was not for want of trying that Mr Sharma
could not engage competent local counsel, but the circumstances
which were unfolding at the time simply limited the avenues to which
he could turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In
my view, Mr Vergis’ argument benefitted from how the circumstances
eventually played out rather than being a true reflection of Mr Sharma’s
state of mind at the time. Mr Sharma had filed an affidavit with
the court’s leave setting out chronologically the lawyers whom he
had directly or indirectly approached to represent him and it is
abundantly clear from this affidavit that his search was limited
only to local SCs (with Mr Edwin Tong as the possible exception).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> There was
a conspicuous absence in his account of events of a single approach
made to a local non-SC. Mr Sharma did not actually ask any non-SC
in the law firms whom he had approached to act. They became unavailable
because those <em>law firms</em> decided
not to accept the brief. In my judgment, this disclosed the mindset of
a man for whom only the very best counsel would do. In the context
of local counsel, that is eminently his prerogative. However, different considerations
come into play for foreign senior counsel. He certainly does not
appear to have contemplated at all that it was still open for him
to approach non-SCs in firms other than those which had already
turned him down. The point being made here is not that a litigant
must exhaust <em>all</em> available local
options before resorting to foreign senior counsel but that there
cannot be a natural gravitation towards local SCs <em>only</em>.
The Court of Appeal in <em>Re Beloff (CA)</em> recognised
this point as much when it made the following observation at [63]
that “it has to be said that while the title of SC is a mark of
professional distinction, one does not have to be an SC to be a very
able litigator”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In
these circumstances, I find that the “special reason” requirement
in s 15(2) of the LPA could not be satisfied on the basis that there
was a lack of availability of local counsel. The situation is quite
to the contrary in fact because Mr Sharma appears to have already
retained a very competent local counsel in Mr Vergis. Whether or
not Mr Sharma wishes for Mr Vergis to continue representing him
in the judicial review proceedings in the light of this decision
is, of course, a matter entirely up to him to decide. However, for
my part, I should say that I was impressed by the quality of Mr
Vergis’ advocacy and he is certainly more than capable of advancing
his client’s position in the judicial review application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The
Applicant therefore fails to satisfy two <em>mandatory</em> requirements in
ss 15(1)(<em>c</em>) and 15(2) of the LPA,
though failure to satisfy <em>either</em> of
the two would have been fatal to the application. Accordingly, the
application is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I
should mention, for completeness, that although I have not, in this judgment,
specifically dealt with the four Notification factors, the first
three of these factors have already been considered in the context
of discussing the “special reason” cited by Mr Sharma (see [74]
above). For the same reasons stated at [76]–[89] above, I am of
the view that the three factors do not weigh in favour of admitting
the Applicant and, accordingly, I would have answered the “ultimate
question” as set out in the fourth Notification in the negative, <em>ie</em>, it is <em>not</em> reasonable,
having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to admit the
Applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In
addition to the prescribed fees payable to the Law Society under s 15(5)
of the LPA, the Law Society is also seeking costs as respondent
to this application. As the application has been dismissed for failure
to satisfy the two mandatory requirements under ss 15(1)(<em>c</em>) and 15(2) of the LPA, there should
normally be costs consequence. However since the costs incurred
by the Law Society as respondent would have been incurred in any event
for which the prescribed fees have already been paid, I make no further
order as to costs for this application.</p>
