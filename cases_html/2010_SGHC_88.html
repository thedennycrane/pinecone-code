<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These cross-appeals arise from two actions
                    between D’Oz International Pte Ltd (“D’Oz”) and PSB
                    Corporation Pte Ltd (“PSB”). In District Court Appeal No 11
                    of 2009 (“DCA 11”), D’Oz appeals against the decision
                    of the District Judge (“the DJ”) to dismiss its claim to be
                    refunded the sum of $120,000 that had been paid as part payment for a franchise
                    fee of $200,000 (“the Franchise Fee”), with interest at the rate
                    of 6% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment. In District
                    Court Appeal No 12 of 2009 (“DCA 12”), PSB appeals
                    against the DJ’s dismissal of its counterclaim for the unpaid balance of
                    $80,000 of the Franchise Fee. The reasons for the DJ’s decisions can be
                    found in <em>D’Oz International Pte Ltd v PSB Corporation
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2009] SGDC 221 (“the
                    GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       D’Oz is a company registered in Singapore.
                    It is in the business of providing management and marketing consultancy services
                    in the international market. PSB is also a company registered in Singapore. It
                    operates and manages educational training centres through its business unit, PSB
                    Academy, in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       PSB had developed a system for operating and
                    running education and training centres known as “PSB Intellis”
                    (“the System”), which it wanted to extend internationally on a
                    franchise basis. An appointed franchisee would have to establish training
                    centre(s), and thereafter operate the training centre(s) in accordance with the
                    System. On 21 September 2002, PSB gave a public presentation on the System.
                    D’Oz attended the presentation, and later submitted an application to PSB
                    for a franchise in the People’s Republic of China (“China”).
                    D’Oz subsequently submitted an executive summary of the proposed
                    franchise, which was to be a joint venture with Beijing Mingzhu University, to
                    PSB. On 19 December 2002, the parties signed a term sheet (“the Term
                    Sheet”) and a preliminary agreement (“the Preliminary
                    Agreement”), and, on 26 December 2002, D’Oz paid a sum of
                    $120,000 to PSB as part payment for the Franchise Fee. Both the Term Sheet and
                    the Preliminary Agreement provided that a franchise agreement was to be executed
                    by the parties, and, on 12 March 2003, the parties signed a franchise
                    agreement (“the Franchise Agreement’). Prior to that, between
                    13 February 2003 and 28 February 2003, training was provided by PSB to
                    D’Oz’s personnel in China and Singapore. For convenience, the
                    franchise that was contemplated between the two parties will hereafter be
                    referred to as “the Franchise”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       During the negotiations between D’Oz and
                    PSB for the Franchise, D’Oz obtained legal advice from a Singapore law
                    firm, but did not seek legal advice on whether the Franchise could be
                    implemented under Chinese law. Unbeknown to both parties, prior to the signing
                    of the Franchise Agreement, the State Council of China had promulgated, on
                    1 March 2003, the “Regulation for Establishing Chinese-[F]oreign
                    Cooperative Schools” (“the 2003 Regulation”),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> which
                    required, in any joint venture educational institution set up in China between
                    Chinese and foreign parties, both the Chinese party and the foreign party to be
                    educational institutions. The 2003 Regulation was scheduled to come into force
                    on 1 September 2003. D’Oz, however, was not an educational
                    institution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In March 2003, D’Oz submitted an
                    application for an education licence (“the Licence”) to the
                    Ministry of Education (“the Ministry”) in Beijing, China. Later,
                    in May 2003, it learnt that its application for the Licence was unsuccessful.
                    Subsequently, PSB submitted a fresh application to the Ministry on behalf of
                    D’Oz, which was again unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 21 July 2004, D’Oz informed PSB in
                    writing that it was suspending “all developmental activities in
                    connection to PSB franchise investment [<em>sic</em>] in
                    China”, pending the clarification of certain information.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On 31 August 2004, D’Oz
                    notified PSB that it had “decided to cease the PSB franchise venture in
                    China with immediate effect”, and stated that it wanted to discuss the
                    refund of the $120,000 that had been paid as part payment for the Franchise
                        Fee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> On
                    1 November 2004, PSB gave notice of its immediate termination of the
                    Franchise Agreement, and also stated that payment of the balance of the
                    Franchise Fee was overdue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    These developments resulted in cross-actions by the parties against each other
                    that have culminated in these appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings in the District Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       D’Oz, in its statement of claim, contended
                    that PSB had misrepresented the value of the System and its potential
                    profitability in the Chinese market. This was denied by PSB, and at the
                    commencement of the trial, D’Oz indicated that it would not be relying on
                    misrepresentation. The trial proceeded on D’Oz’s allegations
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     performance of the Franchise
                        Agreement was frustrated (under Singapore law);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Franchise Agreement was void by reason of the
                        doctrine of common mistake (under Singapore law); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     an event of <em>force
                            majeure</em> had occurred allowing for the rescinding of the
                        Franchise Agreement, the refund of all payments that had been made, and the
                        release of D’Oz from all other obligations (under Chinese
                    law).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In its defence, PSB denied the allegations of
                    frustration, common mistake and <em>force majeure</em>. In
                    its closing submissions, it argued that the doctrines of frustration and
                        <em>force majeure</em> did not operate
                        because:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     the alleged event of frustration or
                            <em>force majeure</em>, which was the promulgation
                        of the 2003 Regulation, took place before the Franchise Agreement was
                        entered into;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     the alleged event of frustration or <em>force
                            majeure</em> was foreseeable;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     the alleged event of frustration or <em>force majeure</em> was self-induced;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     the alleged
                        event of frustration or <em>force majeure</em> no
                        longer existed at the time of termination, as the 2003 Regulation was
                        amended in July 2004, by the “Implementation Measures of the
                        Regulation for Establishing Chinese-[F]oreign Cooperative
                            Schools”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> to allow a foreign party
                        which is not an educational institution to enter into a joint venture
                        educational institution with a Chinese educational
                    institution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">PSB further argued that the Franchise could have
                    been implemented by D’Oz by way of a sub-franchise to a Chinese university
                    or a Chinese commercial entity (such as a “wholly foreign owned
                    enterprise” or a Chinese company) and providing consultancy services
                    to it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The additional
                    contention in defence, in other words, was that D’Oz had failed to adopt
                    all feasible steps to follow through with the Franchise Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On the issue of the governing law, the DJ ruled
                    that the Franchise Agreement was governed by Chinese law, and, therefore, there
                    was no need to deal with the issues of frustration and common mistake (see GD at
                    [18]–[20]). As for the issue of <em>force
                        majeure</em>, she held, in respect of D’Oz’s claim, that
                    (see GD at [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was a supervening event under
                        Chinese law, and this event was the promulgation of the 2003 Regulation on
                        1 March 2003, and not its coming into force on 1 September
                        2003;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        Franchise Agreement formed the entire agreement between the parties, and,
                        therefore, the Term Sheet and the Preliminary Agreement could be
                        disregarded; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     the promulgation of the 2003 Regulation was a discoverable fact and
                        D’Oz had failed to exercise due diligence to discover it before the
                        Franchise Agreement was signed on 12 March 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    DJ concluded that since the promulgation of the 2003 Regulation occurred before
                    the Franchise Agreement was signed, the promulgation of the 2003 Regulation
                    could not constitute an event of <em>force majeure</em> (GD
                    at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The DJ then rejected the contention that the
                    Franchise could have been implemented by way of sub-franchising, as the
                    Franchise Agreement did not provide for sub-franchising (see GD at [41]). The DJ
                    also held that PSB had adduced no evidence, apart from its expert’s
                    opinion, to show that any of its suggested alternatives could have been carried
                    out, and that it had adduced no evidence that it had any right to enforce the
                    Franchise Agreement against D’Oz under Chinese law in the circumstances
                    (see GD at [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Based on her findings, the DJ dismissed both
                    D’Oz’s claim and PSB’s counterclaim (see GD at
                [42]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues raised in these appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The two main issues in these appeals
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether there was no <em>force majeure</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the counterclaim had been established
                        under Chinese law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of this court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The presence of <em>force majeure</em> under
                Chinese law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The DJ found that the Franchise Agreement was
                    governed by Chinese law. Both parties were prepared for such a finding, and
                    called expert witnesses to testify on the effect of Chinese law on the operation
                    of the Franchise Agreement at the trial. The relevant provisions in the Contract
                    Law of China for present purposes are Articles 94, 97, and 117. These provisions
                    read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>

                        state or adopt other remedial measures, and such party shall have the right
                        to demand compensation for damages.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A party who is unable to perform a contract due to <em>force majeure</em> is exempted from liability in part or in whole
                        in light of the impact of the event of <em>force
                            majeure</em>, except otherwise [<em>sic</em>]

                        it is not exempted from such liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purpose of this Law, <em>force majeure</em>

<p class="Judg-1">D’Oz relies on these provisions to claim a refund of its payment
                    of $120,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It is clear that the basis of the dismissal of
                    the claim by the DJ was that the promulgation of the 2003 Regulation occurred
                    before the Franchise Agreement was entered into (see GD at [39]–[40]). It
                    was argued that legal relations <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    Franchise had commenced with the signing of the Term Sheet and the Preliminary
                    Agreement; but this argument was rejected by the DJ due to cl 22 of the
                    Franchise Agreement (see GD at [39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In my view, the DJ has misconstrued the effect
                    of cl 22, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Agreement, the documents referred to herein, and the Schedules and
                        Appendices hereto constitute the entire, full and complete Agreement between
                        the Franchisor and the Franchisee concerning the subject matter hereof, and
                        shall supersede all prior agreements, no other representations having
                        induced the Franchisee to execute this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The DJ held that since cl 22 provides that the Franchise
                    Agreement is the “entire agreement”, the court should disregard
                    the Term Sheet and the Preliminary Agreement (see GD at [39]). However, in my
                    view, this conclusion is contrary to the expert evidence on Chinese law.
                    D’Oz’s expert on Chinese law, Ms Chen Xiaoqin
                    (“Ms Chen”), testified that “the [F]ranchise had
                    already commenced from the moment the [T]erm [S]heet was signed on
                        19/12/2002”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> She also testified that
                    cl 22 did not render void the previously signed Term Sheet and Preliminary
                    Agreement. Her evidence, when re-examined on this issue, was as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    You were referred to clause 22 of the
                            [F]ranchise [A]greement … and asked if you agree that this clause
                            discharged all agreements, etc. and you disagreed. Can you explain why
                            from the Chinese law point of view?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    This sentence states that this is only a
                            supplemental agreement. All the other agreements were not discharged so
                            long as they are consistent. … All the documents are to be
                            executed. The [T]erm [S]heet is the master agreement. All the others are
                            just supplementary. They are to complete and are supplemental to the
                            master agreement. In China, <em>if the new agreement was
                                to supersede the previous agreement, it will state that all the
                                previous agreements will be void and terminated</em>. As such
                            this clause does not discharge the earlier agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In response to Ms Chen’s opinion,
                    Mr Sun Wen Jie (“Mr Sun”), the Chinese law expert called
                    by PSB, gave the view that cl 22 replaced all agreements not referred to
                    expressly in the Franchise Agreement. He said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If I remember correctly, Ms Chen interpreted clause 22 that the
                        [F]ranchise [A]greement and the earlier [T]erm [S]heet and the [P]reliminary
                        [A]greement [<em>sic</em>]. She referred to the [T]erm
                        [S]heet as the master agreement and the [F]ranchise [A]greement was
                        supplementary. I feel that it is incorrect for her to put it in that manner.
                        In accordance to interpretation by Chinese Law, if parties to an agreement
                        have signed a series of agreements, the final agreement signed should be
                        taken as a guide. The last agreement signed should be the final agreement.
                        It is stated very clearly in clause 22 that this agreement shall
                        supersede all prior agreements. The key word here should be
                        [“]supersede[”]. When translated to Chinese, it should mean
                        [“]replace[”]. <em>Unless reference is made in
                            the [F]ranchise [A]greement in respect of some other documents, then I
                            will take it as a whole agreement. But the [F]ranchise [A]greement
                            itself did not make any reference to the [T]erm [S]heet and
                            [P]reliminary [A]greement</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In my view, the two opinions of the two
                    experts do not support the DJ’s understanding of cl 22. Ms Chen
                    took the position that the “entire, full and complete” agreement
                        (<em>per</em> cl 22) between the parties included
                    the Term Sheet and the Preliminary Agreement. Mr Sun, who gave a contrary
                    conclusion, opined that if the Franchise Agreement referred to the Term Sheet
                    and the Preliminary Agreement, then those agreements would form part of the
                    entire agreement pursuant to cl 22. The reason why Mr Sun gave the
                    view that the Term Sheet and the Preliminary Agreement did not form part of the
                    entire agreement was that they were not referred to in the Franchise Agreement.
                    But the Franchise Agreement <em>did</em> refer specifically
                    to the Term Sheet and the Preliminary Agreement – in cl 4.1.
                    Therefore, even on Mr Sun’s interpretation of cl 22, the Term
                    Sheet and the Preliminary Agreement would form part of the entire agreement
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the basis of the expert evidence on Chinese
                    law, the DJ was wrong to disregard the significance of the Term Sheet and the
                    Preliminary Agreement in the whole scheme of things. The evidence on how
                    cl 22 should be construed under Chinese law was that there was a binding
                    agreement between the parties for the Franchise, and this agreement was embodied
                    by the Franchise Agreement, as well as the Term Sheet and the Preliminary
                    Agreement. It could be added that there is no reason to doubt the legal effect
                    of the Term Sheet and the Preliminary Agreement. D’Oz, for one, would not
                    have paid PSB 60% of the Franchise Fee upfront, unless the Term Sheet and/or the
                    Preliminary Agreement, when signed, had legal effect. PSB also would not have
                    provided training to D’Oz’s personnel in China and Singapore, unless
                    the Term Sheet and/or the Preliminary Agreement, when signed, had legal
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As the Term Sheet and the Preliminary
                    Agreement formed part of the entire agreement between the parties, and both
                    documents clearly had legal effect from the time they were signed, there is no
                    reason why a finding that the promulgation of the 2003 Regulation constituted an
                    event of <em>force majeure</em> should be precluded purely
                    on the basis that it had occurred before the signing of the Franchise Agreement.
                    In my view, there was sufficient evidence to establish that the 2003 Regulation
                    in some way – either by its promulgation or its coming into force –
                    constituted an event of <em>force majeure</em>. In this
                    connection, there is no need for me to delve into whether the supervening event
                    was the promulgation of the 2003 Regulation or its coming into force. It could
                    be added that PSB did not challenge the DJ’s finding (see GD at [41]) that
                    it had failed to establish that the Franchise could be implemented in
                    alternative ways after the 2003 Regulation came into force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Accordingly, D’Oz is entitled to a
                    refund of the $120,000 that it had paid as part payment of the Franchise Fee.
                    Having regard to all relevant circumstances, including the period of time that
                    has passed since the commencement of the cross-actions that have led to the
                    present appeals, I see no reason to deny D’Oz its claim for interest, but
                    at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PSB’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The appeal against the decision on the
                    counterclaim was premised on the assumption that the decision of the DJ to
                    dismiss D’Oz’s claim would be upheld by this court. Although, for
                    the reasons provided above, that decision has been reversed, I have some brief
                    comments to make.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In its appeal, PSB accepted that it did not
                    adduce any evidence at the trial on Chinese law as to the consequences of a
                    breach of contract. However, it argued that since the DJ had upheld the validity
                    of the Franchise Agreement under Chinese law, it must follow that D’Oz was
                    contractually liable to pay the balance of $80,000 for the Franchise Fee. PSB
                    argued, further, that the court should in any event apply Rule 18 in
                        <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of
                        Laws</em> vol 1 (Sir Lawrence Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006), which reads (at para 9-001):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rule 18—(1) In any case to which foreign law applies, that law must
                        be pleaded and proved as a fact to the satisfaction of the judge by expert
                        evidence or sometimes by certain other means.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) In the absence of satisfactory evidence of foreign law, the court will
                        apply English law to such a case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Reference was made to a number of local decisions where our courts
                    have presumed Singapore law to be the same as foreign law (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>K-Rex Finance Ltd v Cheng Chih
                        Cheng</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 296, <em>Goh Chok
                        Tong v Tang Liang Hong</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 811, <em>Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 377
                    and <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa</em>
                    [2003] SGHC 126). Accordingly, PSB argued that Rule 18 applies,
                    and that it is entitled to judgment on the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     PSB’s line of argument raises two
                    different issues. The first issue is whether <em>on the
                        evidence</em>, PSB is entitled to judgment for the unpaid balance of
                    $80,000. I agree with PSB’s submission on this issue. My view is that
                    since the DJ held that the Franchise Agreement was not affected by <em>force majeure</em> and therefore remained valid and binding
                    on D’Oz under Chinese law, D’Oz must also remain liable to pay the
                    balance of $80,000 in accordance with the Franchise Agreement’s terms. No
                    further evidence on Chinese law would be necessary to prove liability because it
                    follows that D’Oz, having acquired the Franchise, must pay the unpaid
                    balance of the Franchise Fee. In this connection, it may be noted that the DJ
                    seemed to have held that the balance was not payable because PSB failed to
                    establish that the Franchise could be performed in the alternative ways it had
                    suggested. This, in my view, would be inconsistent with her earlier holding that
                    the Franchise Agreement was not affected by <em>force
                        majeure</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Furthermore, PSB’s arguments on the
                    feasibility of alternative methods of implementation of the Franchise related to
                    D’Oz’s contention that the 2003 Regulation would have prevented
                    D’Oz from setting up a joint venture educational institution in China.
                    D’Oz’s argument became irrelevant in the light of the DJ’s
                    finding that there was no <em>force majeure</em>. If there
                    was no <em>force majeure</em>, it followed that D’Oz
                    must pay for what it had purchased from PSB. If D’Oz could not make use of
                    the Franchise, due to its own fault (as found by the DJ) and not the fault of
                    PSB (see GD at [39]), then D’Oz must pay for the Franchise. That was what
                    the whole case was all about, <em>viz</em>, whether
                    D’Oz was bound by the terms of the Franchise Agreement, and the DJ found
                    that D’Oz was so bound. Logically, the DJ should then have found
                    D’Oz liable on the counterclaim. If the DJ’s decision on
                    D’Oz’s claim is upheld, PSB’s appeal should be allowed.
                    However, this is academic as the DJ’s decision has been
                reversed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Turning to the second issue which pertains to
                    the presumption of similarity of laws, it is only necessary to observe that the
                    presumption is a rule of convenience which the courts may resort to unless it is
                    unjust and inconvenient to do so. It is a rule that is not free from exceptions.
                    Whether a common law court will presume foreign law to be the same as the
                        <em>lex fori</em> in any case where foreign law is not
                    pleaded or not proved (if pleaded) depends on the circumstances of each case.
                    The question that is ordinarily asked when the presumption is invoked is
                    whether, in the circumstances of the case, it would be unjust to apply it
                    against a party so as to make him liable on a claim subject to foreign law when
                    the claimant has failed to prove what the foreign law is and how liability is
                    established under that foreign law (see Richard Fentiman, <em>Foreign Law in English Courts</em> (Oxford University Press,
                    1998) at pp 60–64 and 143–153, cited in <em>Tamil Nadu Electricity Board v ST-CMS Electric Company Private
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 93 at 113). In the New South
                    Wales Court of Appeal case of <em>Damberg v Damberg and
                        Others</em> (2001) 52 NSWLR 492, Heydon JA examined
                    extensively, <em>inter alia</em>, case law from Australia,
                    England, Canada and South Africa, and academic writings on the subject, and
                    concluded that “[t]o state exhaustively when a court would not assume
                    that the unproved provisions of foreign law are identical with those of the lex
                    fori would be a difficult task” (at 522). In the present case, it is just
                    as well that it is not necessary for me to undertake this arduous
                task.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For the reasons given above, D’Oz is
                    entitled to the refund of $120,000 with interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum
                    from the date of the writ to the date of judgment. The appeal in DCA 11 is
