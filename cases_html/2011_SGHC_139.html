<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case involved the resolution of ancillary
                    matters between the parties after their marriage was dissolved by the Family
                    Court on 30 March 2010 with an Interim Judgment awarded to the plaintiff
                    (“the husband”) against the defendant (“the wife”)
                    based on her unreasonable behaviour. The ancillary matters were adjourned by the
                    Family Court to be dealt with on a later date. These pertained to:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Custody, care and control of the child of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 14 January 2011, the ancillary matters came
                    up for hearing before this court. After hearing the submissions from counsel, I
                    made the following orders:</p>

                            interest in two Australian properties (see [9(d)] below without
                            consideration. The cost of transfer for all three properties was to be
                            borne by the husband. In the event the wife failed or refused to execute

                    save on the issue of costs. As such, I shall now set out the reasons for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The husband, who is of German origin but an
                    American citizen, met the wife, a Vietnamese, in Hanoi in 1993 when the husband
                    was then working there for a foreign company. The wife was then employed as a
                    hotel bar waitress. The parties subsequently married in Hanoi in August 1996.
                    When they married, the wife was a single parent having had a daughter, [C], out
                    of wedlock in 1990, from a relationship the wife had at age 19 with a married
                    man.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After the marriage, the parties stayed in
                    Vietnam for 2 years and then moved to Singapore in 1998 when the husband was
                    posted here as a director of sales of an American company. [B] was born in
                    Singapore in July 1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The husband filed his divorce suit on 25 April
                    2008. Initially, the wife contested the divorce by filing a defence. Eventually,
                    after almost two years and after the husband had amended his statement of claim
                    with (according to the wife) “watered” down particulars of the
                    wife’s unreasonable behaviour, the wife withdrew her defence and the
                    husband’s suit proceeded on an uncontested basis resulting in the Interim
                    Judgment being granted on 30 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       For purposes of the ancillaries hearing, the
                    parties filed the requisite affidavits of means. However, the wife’s
                    affidavit of means went beyond what was required; she dredged up unnecessary and
                    irrelevant matters from the time before the parties were married and, for good
                    measure, threw in scurrilous allegations of the husband’s infidelities,
                    his failure to maintain his daughter from a previous marriage as well as charges
                    of abuse and assault. This prompted the husband to file rebuttal affidavits, in
                    response to which she filed even more affidavits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As at the date of the hearing of the
                    ancillaries, the husband resided at the rented premises which he had leased at
                    $2,700 per month for his own and [C]’s accommodation. The wife resided at
                    the matrimonial flat with [B], but with the husband paying all the
                    outgoings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The affidavits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       According to the husband, he had the following
                    assets as of 16 June 2010 (when he filed his affidavit of means):</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The husband exhibited documentary evidence to substantiate the above
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The husband listed his liabilities as his
                    credit card debts (totalling $35,000), taxes owed to the United States tax
                    authorities (totalling US$64,000) and the Singapore tax authorities (totalling
                    $20,200). He is making his income tax payments to the United States and
                    Singapore tax authorities by monthly instalments of $1,480 and $4,086.20
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On her part, the wife listed her assets as the
                    three immoveable properties (<em>viz</em>, the matrimonial
                    flat and the two Australian properties) belonging to the husband. Apart from the
                    matrimonial flat which was in the wife’s sole name, the Australian
                    properties were in the joint names of the couple. There was no dispute on the
                    monetary value of the properties. In addition to the aforesaid three properties,
                    the wife disclosed she owned two properties in Hanoi, Vietnam. One was inherited
                    from her grandfather while the other was purchased by her for VND138,640,000
                    (which is equivalent to US$6,625.64, taking the exchange rate of VND20,924.77 to
                    US$1.00) prior to her marriage to the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The wife listed nine bank accounts that she
                    maintained jointly with the husband, including four accounts maintained with
                    NAB, two of which pertained to the mortgage loans for the Australian properties
                    referred to in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The wife had CPF savings of $1,687.05 in her
                    Ordinary account, $0.36 in her Medisave account and $852.09 in her Special
                    account. The wife listed her monthly expenses as $13,562.70 (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> below) excluding $3,903 for [B]’s
                    expenses. She claimed to have borrowed $12,000 from one Madam Tan Sew Lee
                    because the husband had reduced the amount of maintenance to her as well as his
                    payments for the outgoings of the matrimonial flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The wife did not deny that the husband had
                    paid for all three immoveable properties without any financial contribution from
                    her. However, she claimed she had contributed directly on the basis that from
                    the beginning, it was agreed between the parties that they would place all their
                    monies into their joint accounts to enable them to build up their assets
                    together. She claimed that she took control of and curtailed the household and
                    her own expenses extensively so that the husband could afford the monthly
                    instalments, and that she was to have the matrimonial flat for her sole benefit
                    so that she and [B] could have a roof over their heads. As for maintenance, the
                    wife requested $12,000 for herself and $4,000 for [B], seemingly ignoring the
                    fact that the husband earned a fixed salary of $12,600 and had to maintain
                    himself, three properties as well as [C] (voluntarily).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The wife levelled numerous allegations against
                    the husband which <em>inter alia</em> included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     his infidelities;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     his assaults on
                    her;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     his uncaring
                        attitude towards [B] ,and yet trying to pressurise [B] to go and live with
                        him (which [B] refused);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     his exploiting the estranged relationship between her and
                        [C], which caused [C] to leave the matrimonial flat and to reside at the
                        rented flat with the husband;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a>(e)     his keeping a gun in the house (for which she reported
                        him to the police and which report landed him into
                    trouble);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_f"></a>(f)     his
                        instigating and causing [C] to adopt a rebellious attitude towards her
                        (which she blamed on the husband’s westernised
                    values);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_g"></a>(g)     his using
                        of the children against her to secure his ends;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_h"></a>(h)     his causing or starting quarrels between the
                        parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_i"></a>(i)     his
                        “close” relationship with [C], which was unacceptable as
                        between a stepfather and a teenage daughter;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_j"></a>(j)     his desire to vent his anger against her through
                        proceedings based on her unreasonable behaviour, notwithstanding that she
                        was prepared to file a divorce based on three years’ separation with
                        consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The wife claimed that the husband had given
                    her an assurance that he would always provide for her, [B] and [C], and that he
                    would give her at least one house in the country where he was working, as well
                    as 70% of all his other assets that were acquired from the date of their
                    marriage. That was the reason why the husband had the matrimonial flat
                    registered in the wife’s sole name. The wife further claimed that the
                    husband had agreed not to have any share of the wife’s assets that she
                    acquired prior to or after the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Needless to say, the husband disputed the
                    wife’s claims <em>vis-à-vis</em> her alleged
                    contributions towards the acquisition of the three immoveable properties. He
                    further refuted her allegations set out in <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> to <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above. Indeed,
                    the husband produced evidence to prove that it was the wife who had assaulted
                    him and narrated numerous incidents where the wife had been physically violent
                    towards him, which [C] corroborated in an affidavit filed on the husband’s
                    behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The husband accused the wife of marrying him
                    in order to take advantage of his social status and financial position. While he
                    had a degree, the wife had secondary school education. The husband alleged that
                    when he first met her, the wife enticed him by behaving submissively and was
                    patient and loving. All that changed after he married her. She became a
                    “monster” and a “tyrant” who wanted the comforts of
                    life at his expense. She was never a “planner” as she claimed. The
                    husband also contended that the wife had failed to disclose her jewellery worth
                    $50,000 which had mostly been purchased by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As for the matrimonial flat, the husband
                    explained how he came to purchase it in the wife’s sole name. It was the
                    first property that he bought in Singapore and he had enjoyed living there until
                    he and [C] were forced to leave in December 2006 due to the wife’s violent
                    and erratic behaviour. He maintained he singlehandedly decided to buy the
                    matrimonial flat and had to do careful financial planning in the process to
                    ensure that he could afford the monthly mortgage instalments over and above his
                    other financial obligations and commitments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The husband alleged that when he took an
                    option for the purchase of the matrimonial flat in his name, the wife had
                    threatened him that if he did not transfer the same to her sole name, he would
                    not be allowed to see [B] and [C] who were then aged 6 and 15 respectively.
                    Because of the violent streak exhibited by the wife throughout the marriage (and
                    which was particularised in his statement of particulars in his divorce suit),
                    the husband realised that if he did not give in to her demands, the wife would
                    subject him to physical and mental torture, and possibly also take issue with
                    the two innocent children. Consequently, the husband gave a letter of authority
                    dated 20 March 2006 to the vendor, authorising the latter to transfer the
                    matrimonial property to the wife’s sole name. For the same reason, the
                    husband in his note dated 5 April 2006 (addressed to “To whom it may
                    concern”) certified that in the event of a divorce, he would commit 70%
                    of their common assets to the disposal of the wife and children “for the
                    future wellbeing of [their] children, [C] and [B]”. Unsurprisingly, the
                    wife denied the husband’s allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Although he no longer lived at the matrimonial
                    flat, the husband deposed he paid for all the outgoings including maintenance,
                    repairs, property tax and servicing the mortgage loan of which he was the
                    guarantor. He even had to pay, by monthly instalments of $211.00, for an OSIM
                    chair which the wife purchased. Further, the husband alone deposited monies into
                    the parties’ joint Autosave account with DBS from which only the wife
                    could make withdrawals as she held the automated teller machine
                    (“ATM”) card and personal identification number
                    (“PIN”). The wife utilised the monies to pay [B]’s tuition
                    fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The husband’s salary and quarterly
                    commission from his employer was paid into another DBS account which, contrary
                    to the wife’s claim, was in the husband’s sole name and not in their
                    joint names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The wife had given the following breakdown for
                    her alleged monthly expenses of $13,562.70:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The husband’s contention (which I
                    accepted) was that the wife’s expenses were grossly inflated. For
                    instance, with regard to her claim of $10,000 for holidays, he pointed out that
                    the couple took at most a week off for holidays once a year and the wife’s
                    expenses in items (a) to (d), (g) and (h) above were in any case borne by him.
                    The husband offered $200 per month for the wife’s maintenance. He deposed
                    he would continue to pay [B]’s expenses directly to [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     By the wife’s own admission, the husband
                    treated [C] well – he was the only father [C] had ever known. Yet in the
                    next breath, the wife deposed that she objected to the “closeness”
                    between the husband and [C] getting to unacceptable levels beyond that of a
                    stepfather and a teenage daughter, citing incidents to support her accusation
                    that the relationship was improper. She also deposed that the husband was a bad
                    influence on [C] as he manipulated [C] to leave her to live with
                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The wife’s affidavits admitted that her
                    upbringing for [C] and [B] was harsh as compared with the more liberal methods
                    of the West practised by the husband (whom she complained indulged [C] in
                    whatever the latter wanted). The wife described [C] as rebellious. As for [B],
                    she claimed that the child was very close to her and she no longer needed to
                    discipline the child. As proof of their closeness, the wife exhibited a letter
                    that [B] had written (at pages 53 and 54 of her first affidavit). As [B]’s
                    letter is a telling testimony of the wife’s character, I shall set out the
                    relevant contents; it states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My mum is perfect the way she is. Even though she hits me I forgive her.
                        She’s my mum. I always have to respect her. I must do whatever she
                        wants me to do. I must never disrespect her. I must never “talk
                        back” to her. My mum is never wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The husband deposed he felt deeply sorry for [B] as the letter showed
                    how [B] had been affected by the wife’s tight control and
                violence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As stated earlier at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>, the husband had accused the wife of physically assaulting
                    him, resulting in his making a police report on one occasion and necessitating
                    medical treatment for his injuries which were reflected in photographs exhibited
                    to his affidavit. In this regard, I refer to [C]’s affidavit (filed on 18
                    November 2009) which sadly, reflected what the husband said of the wife and
                    which I will return to below (at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>). [C]
                    deposed that the husband was the only father she had ever known and he loved and
                    treated her as his own daughter. Yet the wife (who is [C]’s own mother),
                    because of a highly suspicious nature, insinuated that their relationship was
                    improper (alluded to earlier at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>) to the extent that she accused [C]
                    of having an affair with the husband. [C] deposed that when the wife became
                    angry and violent, she would call [C], her own daughter, “stupid”,
                    “slut”, “moron” “idiot”. The wife
                    would even tell [C] “You’re so stupid, why don’t you go and
                    die or be a prostitute?” and “If you die, I am very happy. Why
                    don’t you go to the balcony and die”. [C] also listed numerous
                    occasions when she suffered beatings from the wife. The physical violence [C]
                    endured included having her head slammed against the wall, being kicked in the
                    stomach, being tied up in chairs with hands and feet bound, and being stabbed in
                    the thigh with a fork for accidentally burning food. [C] had witnessed the
                    wife’s violence towards the husband whenever they quarrelled, causing [C]
                    to have sleepless nights. At such quarrels, the wife would often threaten to
                    kill them all (including [B]). What was noteworthy was the fact that in her
                    affidavits, the wife did not deny the allegations of violence but defended and
                    justified her actions against the husband, [C] and even [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It was apparent from the affidavits that had
                    been filed that the wife had a violent disposition with the husband and two
                    children on the receiving end. She had serious anger management issues that
                    needed to be addressed and treated before [B] suffered more at her hands. Hence
                    the order I made in [2(h)]. Between the wife’s version of events on the
                    one hand and the husband’s (and [C]’s) version on the other, I was
                    more inclined to accept the latter’s versions as the more credible. As [C]
                    put it so poignantly in para 4 of her affidavit:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is with great difficulty that I am coming forward to make this
                        affidavit as I do not wish to take sides in the proceedings. Furthermore, I
                        know that after the Defendant sees this, she will be very angry with me and
                        our relationship will become even more strained. However, I feel obligated
                        to tell the truth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And added in para 5:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the Defendant married the Plaintiff, I was so happy because I finally
                        got a father whom I never had since birth. We were very close initially.
                        However, the Defendant had this jealous streak in her. She is extremely
                        possessive and hateful to any woman who would be coming near the Plaintiff.
                        She accused almost any woman that came in contact, even just talking with
                        the Plaintiff, of having an affair with him. She has so far accused all our
                        maids and even my aunt when she visited us once of having an affair with the
                        Plaintiff. The Plaintiff became fearful o talking to them. But I never
                        thought that her jealousy and hatred would extend even to me, her own blood.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Then in para 15, [C] deposed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In November 2006, the Defendant locked my sister, the maid and I in the
                        house and went out. Earlier that day, she had quarreled [<em>sic</em>] with the Plaintiff and kicked him out of the home. The
                        Plaintiff returned later that night after the Defendant went out but could
                        not come in as the gate was locked, and asked me to help him get his laptop
                        and pass it to him through the locked gate. I could not find the
                        Plaintiff’s laptop as I believe the Defendant had put it in her
                        bedroom, which was locked, and the Plaintiff then called the police. When
                        the police arrived, they interviewed me and took my statement. When I found
                        out that the Plaintiff was moving out of the home, I had voluntarily asked
                        him if I could move out together with him as I have been very traumatized by
                        the Defendant’s behaviour and abuse, pushing me into depression, and I
                        no longer wanted to live in constant fear of being attacked by her
                        everyday.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     To my mind, no child, let alone a daughter
                    (who is usually closer to the mother), would turn against her own mother unless
                    the latter had mistreated her. In [C]’s case, it must have been very hard
                    for her to affirm an affidavit to support the husband. The wife so traumatized
                    her that [C] no longer wanted to live under the same roof as her own natural
                    mother but chose instead, to live with someone whom she regarded as a father,
                    notwithstanding that he was not her biological parent. The wife’s anger at
                    the husband and [C] was unabated even after they had moved out, although she was
                    the cause of such a move. According to [C], the wife created a ruckus outside
                    the rented flat on two occasions with her screaming, upsetting not only [C]
                    (whom she abused verbally) but also [B] who was then at the flat on the second
                    occasion, prompting the husband to call the police.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     My poor perception of the wife was
                    corroborated by [B]’s note set out in <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above which as observed earlier, was produced by the wife.
                    I shared the husband’s concern for [B] – the child was unlikely to
                    have a happy childhood with a mother who totally controlled her life and
                    disciplined her harshly. The character of the wife was also reflected in the
                    fact that she had had five maids in a span of six years between 2003 and 2009,
                    while the husband was residing at the matrimonial flat. He deposed that no maid
                    could withstand her treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     There was also a vindictive side to the
                    wife’s character. She destroyed the husband’s guitar and threw away
                    hundreds of his photographs and slides which he had accumulated from childhood.
                    The husband deposed that he owned a prized t-shirt on which he had procured in
                    1994 the signatures of eight professional players of the 93 Super Bowl Dallas
                    Cowboys American Football team. The t-shirt which he carefully wrapped in a
                    plastic cover used to hang in the husband’s wardrobe at the matrimonial
                    flat, but had since gone missing, to the husband’s dismay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the light of the above observations, it was
                    very hard to believe the wife’s claim that she had contributed
                    substantially to a stable home, was solely responsible for the upkeep and
                    maintenance of the home and the upbringing of the children. Such an idyllic
                    picture was far from the truth that emerged from the affidavits filed for these
                    proceedings. Instead, the wife had humiliated and mistreated the husband and her
                    two children and hindered the husband’s career advancement. His marriage
                    to her had been a misery. Considering she had domestic help (albeit five maids
                    in six years) one wonders how large a role she played as a homemaker bearing in
                    mind her other roles as a wife and mother left much to be desired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Although she had no supporting evidence, the
                    wife accused the husband of failing or refusing to disclose other bank accounts,
                    his stock options and other sources of income (apart from his employment). The
                    husband’s reply affidavit proved that her allegations were completely
                    unfounded suspicions, including the fact that he had failed to disclose his
                    rental income from the Australian properties. The husband had used the rental
                    over the years to service the mortgage payments. I noted the husband’s
                    statement that the wife had never stepped foot into either Australian property
                    so it was questionable what contribution the wife actually made. Her allegation
                    that the husband had stock options from his employer was absurd in any case as
                    he is working for a start-up, not a public company. Stock options in private
                    companies have no value if the company does not go public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I turn next to the division of the matrimonial
                    assets, in particular that of the matrimonial flat. Earlier (at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> and <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>), I had set out the parties’ differing versions of how
                    the matrimonial flat came to be transferred to the wife’s sole name, even
                    though the option was given by the vendor in the husband’s name and
                    exercised jointly by the husband and the wife. Having viewed photographs of the
                    injuries inflicted by the wife on the husband when she assaulted him on one
                    occasion, I can well believe that the husband was fearful that she would assault
                    him if he did not give in to her demands, including carrying out her threats to
                    deny him access to [B] and [C]. There was no other reason why the husband would
                    voluntarily give the wife the entire matrimonial flat, which he paid for from
                    his hard earned money with no contribution from the wife to whom he was
                    unhappily married. It was blackmail on her part that forced the husband to agree
                    to the matrimonial flat being transferred to her sole name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Unlike the husbands who had made gifts to the
                    wives in <em>Wong Ser Wan v Ng Cheong Ling</em> [2006] 1
                    SLR(R) 416 (“<em>Wong Ser Wan</em>”) and
                        <em>Yeo Gim Tong Michael v Tainzon Lolita</em> [1996] 1
                    SLR(R) 633 (“<em>Yeo Gim Tong Michael</em>”),
                    the matrimonial flat was not a gift to the wife by the husband. The court should
                    not condone the wife’s actions by allowing her to retain the flat. For the
                    same reason, I rejected the validity of the husband’s note dated 5 April
                    2006 (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). The orders that I
                    made in [2(a)] recognised that the husband was the only party that paid for the
                    three immoveable properties jointly owned by the parties because he produced
                    cogent evidence to prove that he alone funded their acquisition as opposed to
                    the wife’s bare assertions of her contributions (which were none in any
                    case). Similarly, under [2(i)], all the monies in the joint accounts maintained
                    by the couple with DBS and NAB originated from the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The wife also had a selfish side to her
                    nature. As observed earlier at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>), she
                    claimed for her and [B]’s maintenance, sums well in excess of the
                    husband’s monthly salary, completely disregarding his own needs and
                    expenses. She wanted a share of everything the husband owned, but refused to
                    allow him any share in her assets. There was also no reason why a person in the
                    wife’s position should need the inflated sums she was claiming for her
                    personal expenses, bearing in mind she was not a working woman (although she
                    could – and, according to the husband, should – work). It was
                    dishonest of her to claim as her monthly expenses the outgoings for the
                    matrimonial flat which she well knew the husband was paying and still pays,
                    while she continued to enjoy living there to his exclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The husband, on the other hand, was not only
                    selfless but magnanimous. Although, as I pointed out to the wife’s
                    counsel, the husband was not legally obliged to (since [C] was not his child),
                    the husband took it upon himself to pay for [C]’s two-year course in
                    International Business (leading to a degree from the [D University]) at the [E
                    Institute] which fees totalled $40,000. These fees were in addition to
                    [C]’s monthly living expenses of $2,735 (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). The wife repeatedly deposed that [C] was not the
                    husband’s child, completely overlooking the fact that without the
                    husband’s voluntary financial support of [C], she as [C]’s mother
                    would have had to bear the costs of [C]’s education and living expenses.
                    Gratitude was another virtue the wife did not seem to possess.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     A factor the wife obviously overlooked in her
                    appeal against my order in [2(f)] was the fact that at 20½ years of age, no
                    court of law should order [C] to live with the wife if [C] did not want to.
                    Forcing [C] to return to live with the wife may cause her to run away. The court
                    must respect [C]’s wishes as she will turn 21 soon and is old enough to
                    make her own decisions. I viewed with considerable scepticism the wife’s
                    allegation that the husband exercised undue influence over [C]. Given the ill
                    treatment [C] had suffered at the wife’s hands, it is little wonder that
                    she left the matrimonial flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I noted that the parties were married in
                    August 1996 and divorced in March 2010. However, the marriage had broken down
                    for all intents and purposes in December 2006, when the husband was forced to
                    leave the matrimonial flat. Quite apart from the fact that it was an unhappy
                    marriage for the husband, the union only lasted ten years. Whilst it could not
                    be said to be a short marriage, neither was it a long one. The husband is 50
                    while the wife is 42 years of age. She has a longer working life than him. She
                    should find herself gainful employment in the spa, hairdressing or beauty saloon
                    industry as, in her defence to the divorce suit, she stated her occupation as a
                    nail and make-up artist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the closing submissions tendered on her
                    behalf, counsel for the wife repeatedly argued that the wife was entitled to
                    maintain a lifestyle she had become accustomed to, after marrying the husband.
                    Whilst it is true he gave her a lifestyle she could never have dreamt of had she
                    remained a single parent in Vietnam, the fact remains that the wife made no
                    contributions towards the marriage in terms of acquisition of or, improvement of
                    the matrimonial assets. In this regard s 114(2) of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>
                    below) comes to mind. Neither did she take care of the physical and/or emotional
                    wellbeing of the family. The cases cited by her counsel including <em>Wong Ser Wan</em> and <em>Yeo Gim Tong
                        Michael</em> (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above)
                    therefore have no application to the wife as the facts were distinguishable.
                    None of the factors in s 112(2)(a),(d) or (g) of the Women’s Charter can
                    be said to apply in the wife’s favour. To recapitulate, s 112
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Power of court to order division of matrimonial
                            assets</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant
                        of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to
                        order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale
                        of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of
                        the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and
                        equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to
                        exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have
                        regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following
                        matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money,
                            property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the
                            matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either
                            party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare
                            of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family
                            or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership
                            and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of
                            divorce;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f) any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one
                            party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other
                            party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(g) the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other
                            party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of
                            assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of
                            his or her occupation or business; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(h) the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are
                            relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) The court may make all such other orders and give such directions as
                        may be necessary or expedient to give effect to any order made under this
                        section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Section 112(1) requires the court to make a
                    just and equitable division between the parties of their matrimonial assets. In
                    doing so in this case and applying either the “broad brush”
                    approach in <em>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng</em> [2001] 2
                    SLR(R) 260 (at [14]) or the global
                    assessment methodology and/or classification methodology advocated in <em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743, I found it hard put to find
                    any contribution made by the wife directly or indirectly, towards the
                    acquisition of or improvement of the matrimonial/the husband’s assets or
                    to the marriage in general.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Turning next to maintenance, I had given the
                    wife a substantial lump sum award amounting to $250,000. The lump sum recognised
                    the standard of living the husband had provided for her previously, his means
                    and the parties’ ages. It was also to achieve a clean break between the
                    parties so that the husband in particular could move on with his life. This was
                    in keeping with s 114 of the Women’s Charter, which states:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Assessment of maintenance</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid
                        by a man to his wife or former wife, the court shall have regard to all the
                        circumstances of the case including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial
                            resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to
                            have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each
                            of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the
                            foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown
                            of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to
                            the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking
                            after the home or caring for the family; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(g) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the
                            value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for
                            example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of
                            the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour
                        so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to
                        their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would
                        have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly
                        discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the
                        other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">My view was that the wife had not discharged her financial obligations
                    or responsibilities towards the husband under s 114(2)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The husband had offered $200 per month (or a
                    lump sum of $200,000) as maintenance for the wife. I raised the figure fivefold
                    to $1,000 per month computed over 20 years, totalling $240,000. This sum would
                    serve as adequate provision for the wife’s maintenance until she turned 62
                    on the basis she would work and continue working until she reached that age. I
                    also awarded an extra $10,000 to assist the wife in the expense of shifting out
                    of the matrimonial flat and into the rented premises if she so desired. At 42
                    years of age, the wife should be able to find gainful employment in the beauty
                    industry for which she had been trained. It cannot be overlooked that the
                    husband has expenses of $7,875.65 per month on rent, [B] and [C] (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), not including his own expenses and
                    mortgage instalments. The wife’s standard of living had to be looked at in
                    the light of the husband’s monthly income of $12,600. The commission he
                    earned was not only variable but uncertain as he would not be paid any
                    commission when he failed to achieve his sales targets. It was the
                    husband’s case that the divorce and related proceedings, as well as the
                    wife’s conduct, had adversely affected his work performance and hence his
                    commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The orders that I made regarding [B]’s
                    custody, care and control, were in keeping with the parties’ wishes while
                    the maintenance order for [B] was to preserve the status quo. Payments to third
                    parties for [B]’s schooling and related expenses would continue to be paid
                    directly by the husband or by GIRO arrangements to avoid the possibility, as the
                    husband feared, that the wife would make use of his payments for herself. The
                    wife was allowed to retain her two properties in Vietnam (for which she made the
                    husband sign a disclaimer of interest dated 7 April 2008 before the Vice Consul
                    of the American Embassy in Singapore) and also all her jewellery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Finally, the wife was ordered to vacate the
                    matrimonial flat in the light of my order that she transfers the title thereof
                    to the husband. To avoid further acrimony between the parties, I made no orders
                    for costs but gave the parties liberty to apply in relation to implementing any
                    of the orders made.</p>
