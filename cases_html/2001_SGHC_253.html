<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.    Khai Wah-Ferco Pte Ltd ("the Company") was a

wholly-owned subsidiary of the defendants – L&amp;M Group Investments Ltd

("L&amp;M"). By two Sale and Purchase Agreements dated 3 October 1997 and 2

December 1997 (referred to together as "the contract"), L&amp;M sold its entire

holding in the Company to the plaintiff – Tan Hock Keng ("Tan"). The sale

was on a net tangible asset ("NTA") basis and the contract provided for

adjustments to be made between the parties in respect of trade debts not recovered within

12 months from due date (cl 14.2), and credit notes given or received by the Company

for work done, or for supplies prior to 30 September 1997 (cll 14.3 and 14.4). Clause

16.1, set out below, limited L&amp;M’s total liability to Tan for all claims of any

kind to the Consideration Sum:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The parties hereby agree that the total liability of the Vendor

  for all claims of any kind whether in contract, warranty, indemnity, tort, strict

  liability or otherwise, arising out of the performance or breach of this Agreement or any

  of the terms herein shall not exceed the Consideration Sum as determined in accordance

  with Clause 4.1 …"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Consideration Sum referred to in cl 16.1 was S$285,900.</p>
<p xmlns="">2.    At the time of the share transfer the Company owed a considerable

sum of money - an amount in excess of S$5 million - to L&amp;M, its parent company.

The contract, in cl 15.1, required Tan to procure that the Company repaid these

intercompany loans. It will be necessary to consider this clause in detail and I therefore

set it out in full: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The Purchaser shall procure that the Company repays the

  Intercompany Loans as free of interest over 12 instalments commencing on 15 April 1999 and

  on every anniversary thereafter (the ‘repayment date’) at a principal sum of

  thirty percent (30%) of the Company’s consolidated net profit after tax or

  S$220,000.00 per annum, whichever is the higher, and in any event on the twelfth and final

  repayment date the Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall repay all balance

  outstanding Intercompany Loans to the Vendor in one lump sum. In consideration of the

  Vendor agreeing to a repayment of the Intercompany Loans over 12 annual instalments,

  the Purchaser shall procure that THK REALTY PTE LTD shall deliver to the Vendor the duly

  executed and stamped Guarantee."</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">3.    L&amp;M disputed any liability to Tan under the provisions of cl

14. In the event L&amp;M was held liable, L&amp;M sought to limit that liability by

invoking cl 16.1. Tan, however, disputed the applicability of cl 16.1 to cl 14. It

was submitted on behalf of Tan that it was the intention of the parties, in view of the

Consideration Sum having been arrived at on an NTA basis, that cl 16.1 was only - to use

the words of Mr Tan Bar Tien ("Mr BT Tan) who appeared for Tan - "a reference

clause" that was intended by the parties to be operational only if specifically

invoked in the other clauses in the contract.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    The claims against L&amp;M under cl 14 related to transactions

with various customers and the documentation relating thereto was voluminous. In the

course of the hearing, counsel for L&amp;M, Mr Chia Chor Leong, at the invitation of the

court, indicated that if the court ruled that cl 16.1 had the effect of limiting his

clients’ liability to the Consideration Sum, his clients would accept liability up to

that sum. I therefore suggested that even though we were only about mid-way through

the trial, the parties make their submission on the applicability of cl 16.1 to cl 14 and

that further evidence relating to the details of the claims against L&amp;M under cl 14

would be gone into only if the court rules that cl 16.1 does not affect cl 14. Both

parties agreed to this suggestion.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    Mr BT Tan – in support of his submission that cl 16.1 was

only a reference clause and therefore inapplicable to cl 14 because there was nothing in

cl 14 that invoked cl 16 – wished to refer to previous drafts of the contract that

had been prepared by M/s Haridass Ho &amp; Partners, the firm of solicitors who had acted

for both parties in this sale and purchase. Mr Chia, relying on ss 94, 95 and 96 of the

Evidence Act, objected to any reference to any extrinsic material in the construction of

the contract. Mr BT Tan submitted that such extrinsic evidence was admissible under s

94(f) of the Evidence Act.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    Section 94(f) of the Evidence Act reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"94. When the terms of such contract, grant or other disposition

  of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have

  been proved according to section 93, <i>no evidence of any oral agreement or statement

  shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument or their representatives

  in interest for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its

  terms subject to the following provisions</i>:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">(f) any fact may be proved which shows in what matter the language of a

  document is related to existing facts."</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added.)</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The effect of adopting the submission of Mr BT Tan would be that cl

16.1 would not have the general application which, on its face, it clearly had. Instead, a

proviso would have to be read into cl 16.1 to the effect that cl 16.1 would apply only if

specifically invoked by other clauses in the contract. Evidence that that was what the

parties had agreed to was clearly prohibited under s 94 unless the matter fell into one of

the provisos to s 94, in this case (on the submission of Mr BT Tan) proviso (f). Mr

BT Tan did not refer me to any decided case that supported his contention. He was content

merely to read out the entire commentary on s 94(f) given in <i>Butterworths’

Annotated Statutes of Singapore</i> (Vol 5; 1997 issue).</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    Mr Chia, in his submissions, pointed out that that commentary in <i>Butterworths</i>,

far from supporting Mr BT Tan’s submission, in fact negated it. Mr Chia pointed out

that the very first paragraph of the said commentary on s 94(f) in <i>Butterworths</i>

stated: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"This proviso is, strictly speaking, providing for the <i>interpretation</i>

  of a contract, grant or other disposition. Although it might have been grouped with the

  rules of interpretation which are laid down in the ensuing sections, it has been treated

  as a proviso to the principle of conclusiveness set out in s 94. <i>It seems, therefore,

  that this proviso enacts that interpretation of the terms which have been reduced to

  writing is not varying, contradicting, adding to or subtracting from the written terms</i>

  and opens the way to the more elaborate rules of interpretation laid down in the ensuing

  section."</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added.)</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This first paragraph itself, Mr Chia submitted, made it clear that s

94(f) of the Evidence Act comes into play only when a word or phrase is unclear and the

court has to interpret or ascertain what that word or phrase means. The commentary in <i>Butterworths</i>,

he pointed out, was not mandating the wholesale reference to extrinsic evidence in

construing a contract.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    Mr Chia pointed out that in the present case, Mr BT Tan had not

alleged that there was doubt about any word or phrase used in cl 16.1. Mr Chia submitted

that the meaning of every word used in cl 16.1 was clear and unambiguous and that, in that

scenario, s 94(f) cannot be invoked to let in extrinsic evidence. In support of his

submission, Mr Chia quoted a number of English authorities. I need only refer to the

following.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    In <i>Great Western Railway and Midland Railway v Bristol

Corporation </i>[1918] 87 Ch.D 414, the court was concerned with the meaning to be

attributed to the word "traffic" in an agreement made between the Bristol

Corporation and railway companies wherein rates were payable on excess traffic. The issue

was whether extrinsic evidence was admissible to explain what the parties intended by the

word "traffic". What Lord Shaw said at page 424 is apposite: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The question is: What does the word ‘traffic’ or what

  does the expression ‘traffic taken by or delivered to the companies

  respectively’ mean?</p>
<p align="justify">In the first place, I desire to express my opinion that the word and

  expression quoted do not appear to me to be ambiguous. <i>There being no ambiguity I am

  accordingly further of opinion</i>, speaking for myself, <i>that it was not competent to

  introduce a reference to facts, history, and circumstances for the purpose of

  specialising, modifying, or restricting the unambiguous terms of the agreement of partie</i>s.

  I assent to the view that, if from other parts of the contract, it could be shown that a

  special or restricted meaning was given to the word ‘traffic’, or if in those

  other parts the word ‘traffic’ was so employed as to render it doubtful in what

  sense the term was used in clause 6, then the contract read as a whole might make evidence

  <i>dehors</i> the contract admissible for light upon interpretation. There is, however

  – the term being in clause 6 unambiguous – no obscurity cast upon it by

  other parts of the agreement, and, in my view, nothing accordingly for outside history or

  facts to clear up."</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added.)</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">and at the same page, in a later paragraph, Lord Shaw said:</p>
<ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"<i>The simple and familiar rule</i>, as Lord Campbell pointed out

  in <i>MacDonald v Longbottom</i> … <i>is that evidence is not admissible to

  contradict a document but solely to interpret it</i>. It may have a special, commercial or

  mercantile or technical meaning, and to deny such a meaning to it in the circumstances in

  which – or with reference to which – it was used, would be to make it express

  something else than the words were set down for. But the rule is used with a dangerous

  elasticity in practice whenever by outside evidence it is sought to introduce some

  intention of the writer which has been disclosed by any other than the authorised channel

  – namely, the words which he himself selected."</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added.)</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In that same page, Lord Shaw very lucidly states the function of a

court in interpreting a contractual provision. In his words:</p>
<ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"… Courts of law when on the work of interpretation are not

  engaged upon the task or study of what parties intended to do, but of what the language

  which they employ shows that they did: in other words, they are not constructing a

  contract on the lines of what may be thought to have been what the parties intended, but

  they are construing the words and expressions used by the parties themselves. What do

  these mean? That when ascertained is the meaning to be given effect to, the meaning of the

  contract by which the parties are bound. The suggestion of an intention of parties

  different from the meaning conveyed by the words employed is no part of interpretation,

  but is mere confusion."</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">10.    In <i>Prenn v Simmonds</i> [1971] 1 WLR 1381, Lord Wilberforce

who dealt with an attempt to introduce into evidence for the purpose of construing a

contract the previous drafts of that contract, had this to say at page 1384:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"… the present case illustrates very well the disadvantages

  and danger of departing from established doctrine and the virtue of the latter. There were

  prolonged negotiations between solicitors, with exchanges of draft clauses, ultimately

  emerging in clause 2 of the agreement. The reason for not admitting evidence of these

  exchanges is not a technical one or even mainly one of convenience, (though the attempt to

  admit it did greatly prolong the case and add to its expense). It is simply that such

  evidence is unhelpful. By the nature of things, where negotiations are difficult, the

  parties’ positions, with each passing letter, are changing and until the final

  agreement, though converging, still divergent. It is only the final document which records

  a consensus. If the previous documents used different expressions, how does construction

  of those expressions, itself a doubtful process, help on the construction of the

  contractual words? If the same expressions are used, nothing is gained by looking back;

  indeed something may be lost since the relevant surrounding circumstances may be

  different. And at this stage there is no consensus of the parties to appeal to."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">11.    The Evidence Act is an enactment that codifies the Law of

Evidence as it applies to Singapore. The position under the English common law may not

therefore reflect the law of evidence as it applies to Singapore. The provisions of the

Indian Evidence Act, on which Act our Evidence Act is based, are – in relation to the

exclusion of oral evidence by documentary evidence - in pari materia with the relevant

provisions in our Act. It will therefore be useful to look at how the equivalent provision

in the Indian Act has been dealt with.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    The commentary in Sarkar on <i>Evidence</i> (14<sup>th</sup> Ed)

in relation to proviso (6) of s 92 of the Indian Evidence Act (the equivalent of our

s 94(f) reads (at page 1282) as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"This is the last of the proviso to this section and is expressed

  in very general terms. This is really a rule regarding the interpretation or construction

  of documents, and it embodies one of its principal canons. Wherever a court has to deal

  with a document which has been proved, its object is to endeavour to ascertain its real

  meaning, and for this purpose extrinsic evidence is sometimes necessary. So the proviso

  says that ‘any fact may be proved which shows in what manner the language of a

  document is related to existing facts’. <i>The object of the admissibility of the

  evidence of surrounding circumstances is to ascertain the real intentions of the parties,

  but those intentions must be gathered from the language of the document as explained by

  the extrinsic evidence. No evidence of any intention inconsistent with the plain meaning

  of the words used will be admitted, for the object is not to vary the language used, but

  merely to explain the sense in which the words are used by the parties</i>. This rule of

  interpretation is not so easy as it may appear, and it is not possible to define its

  precise limits in view of the ever changing facts involved in every case. Generally

  speaking, in case of ambiguity or doubt as to its meaning extrinsic evidence of intimately

  connected existing facts or surrounding circumstances may be given in order to find out

  the real nature of the transaction in the document."</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">And at page 1283, Sarkar summarises the position as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Prov (6) comes into play when there is latent ambiguity in a

  document, ie when its language is not <i>prima facie</i> consistent with the existing

  facts, or in other words, when there is a conflict between the plain meaning of the

  language used and the facts existing or when put together they lead to an ambiguity …

  <i>If the language employed is ambiguous and admits of a variety of meaning, the 6<sup>th</sup>

  proviso can be invoked. The object of admissibility of such evidence is to assist the

  Court to get the real intention of the parties and thereby overcome the difficulty caused

  by the ambiguity</i>."</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Sarkar at page 1283 adverts to the link between proviso 7 to s 92 (of

the Indian Act) and the subsequent sections of the Act. He states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Its application (ie the application of proviso 6 to s 92) will

  appear from the provisions of ss 93-98. When the language is on the face ambiguous or

  defective, extrinsic evidence is not admissible (s 93), for admission of such evidence

  would not be interpreting a contract, but making a new one. Such a course would be

  upholding a document which is void for uncertainty. <i>When the language is plain in

  itself or unambiguous and when it applies accurately to existing facts, extrinsic evidence

  is also inadmissible (s 94). To do so would be to allow the parties to show that they

  meant something different from what they have plainly expressed, and to alter the document</i>.

  Parol evidence is in no case admissible to alter or vary the terms of a written

  instrument.</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">13.    The s 94 referred to in Sarkar is identical to s 96 of our Act.

Section 96 of our Act reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"When language used in a document is plain in itself and when it

  applies accurately to existing facts, evidence may not be given to show that it was not

  meant to apply to such facts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Clause 16.1 is very clear in its terms. It does not, on the face of it,

purport to be merely a "reference clause". Section 96 would therefore preclude

the admission of any evidence designed to show that cl 16.1 was meant to have effect only

as a reference clause.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    On the strength of the above authorities, I was satisfied that

the extrinsic evidence (including the previous drafts of the contract) that Mr BT Tan was

seeking to rely on to establish the underlying intention of cl 16.1 of the contract was

inadmissible in evidence and I so ruled.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.    The next question that had to be resolved was whether there was

any substance in Mr BT Tan’s submission that cl 16.1 had no application to cl 14

because cl 14 did not, in terms, invoke cl 16. In support of that submission, Mr BT

Tan pointed out other clauses in the contract, such as cll 6, 7 and 10, which specifically

make themselves subject to cl 16. He submitted that it was because the parties had

intended that cl 14 should not be subject to cl 15 that those words were not incorporated

into cl 14.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    I saw no merit in that submission. Clause 16 clearly and

unambiguously states that the total liability of the vendor (ie L&amp;M) arising out of

the performance or breach of any term of contract shall not exceed the Consideration Sum.

That restriction is worded in such wide language that it clearly will restrict any

liability attaching to L&amp;M under cl 14. The fact that other clauses may have

specifically invoked cl 16 does not detract from this fact and cannot form a basis for me

to conclude that cl 16.1 was to be only a "reference clause".</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    Mr BT Tan further submitted that cl 14 was repugnant to

cl 16 and the parties could not have intended cl 16.1 to override cl 14.

It would be relevant, in considering that submission, to refer to what Lord Bingham

stated in <i>Pagnan SpA v Tradax Ocean Transportation SA</i> [1987] 2 All ER 565 at 574b:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"It is commonplace of documentary construction that an apparently

  wide and absolute provision is subject to limitation, modification or qualification by

  other provisions. That does not make the later provisions inconsistent or repugnant."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I saw no repugnancy between cll 14 and 16.1. I therefore ruled that the

limitation of liability provided under cl 16.1 would apply to any liability that L&amp;M

may have under cl 14.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    In the light of the above ruling and in the light of the fact

that L&amp;M had agreed to accept liability under cl 14 up to the Consideration Sum (ie

S$285,900), there was no need to hear further evidence relating to such liability.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    L&amp;M had counterclaimed against Tan for the sum of

$751,504.13. Included within this sum was the sum of $440,000 being two instalments of

$220,000 each that were due from the Company to L&amp;M in payment of the outstanding

intercompany loan of some S$5 million.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    As noted in paragraph 2 above, Tan had, in cl 15.1 of the

contract, undertaken that he would procure the repayment of that loan. In effect, Tan had,

by cl 15.1, agreed to do the following:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) Procure that the Company repay the intercompany loan in 12

  instalments commencing 15 April 1999 of $220,000 per annum.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) On the last instalment date, procure that the Company repay the

  entire balance of the intercompany loans.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Procure that THK Realty Pte Ltd (which was the family holding

  company of Tan) shall deliver to L&amp;M a guarantee that the intercompany loans will be

  repaid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr BT Tan conceded that, except in respect of the two instalments of

the intercompany loans claimed (totalling $440,000), his client accepted liability on the

balance of the $751,504.13 sought in the counterclaim. Mr BT Tan disputed liability for

the instalments on the grounds that his client’s obligation under cl 15.1 was only to

procure that the Company pay the instalments: his client had not, by the terms of cl 15.1,

undertaken personal liability to pay the instalments should the Company fail to pay.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.    The key words in cl 15 were as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The Purchaser shall procure that the Company repays the

  Intercompany Loans … "</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Both Mr Chia and Mr BT Tan referred to <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>

for the meaning of the word "procure". The definition in <i>Black’s</i> was

adopted in a case referred to me by Mr Chia (<i>The People of the State of New York v

Davan Executive Services Inc</i>, 411 NYS 2d 532 at 534 where the judge held:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">" The term ‘procure’, interpreted according to its clear

  and logical tenor, means ‘to cause a thing to do done; to instigate; to

  contrive, bring about, effect or cause’. "</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In <i>Chambers (21<sup>st</sup> Century Dictionary)</i> the meaning is

given as:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"to manage to obtain something or bring it about"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr Chia submitted that by agreeing to cl 15, Tan was under an

obligation to ensure that the Company paid the instalments to L&amp;M. The fact that the

Company did not repay the two instalments meant that Tan had breached his obligations to

L&amp;M to procure these payments and was liable to damages for that breach. The quantum

of damages, Mr Chia submitted, would be the same as the instalments not paid.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    Mr BT Tan submitted that the word "procure" does not

connote an undertaking to pay the money himself. All that Tan had agreed to do in cl 15,

he submitted, was to cause the Company to pay. He submitted that if it was intended by the

parties that there should be a personal liability on Tan to pay, clearer words would be

called for. In support of this submission, Mr BT Tan relied on the following passage from

Phillips and O’Donovan <i>"The Modern Contract of Guarantee</i>", 2<sup>nd</sup>

Ed, at page 18:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"To support a guarantee they (ie the words used) must amount to a

  firm undertaking to pay if the principal debtor defaults."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr BT Tan did not dispute that Tan was in breach of cl 15 in failing to

procure that the Company paid the instalments but submitted that as Tan had not undertaken

a personal liability to pay if the Company failed to pay, Tan would be liable to L&amp;M

only in damages for such losses arising from that breach that L&amp;M could prove. In

assessing such damages, he submitted, the court would have to take into account such

amounts as may have been retrieved by L&amp;M had L&amp;M taken steps to mitigate its

loss.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    Mr Chia, relying on the House of Lords decision in the case of <i>Moschi

v Lep Air Services Ltd &amp; Ors </i>[1973] AC 331, submitted that a personal undertaking

to pay was but one of two possible ways in which the payment of a debt can be guaranteed.

In that case, Lep Air were forwarding agents for goods imported by a company known as

Rolloswin Investments Ltd which was controlled by one Gabriel Moschi. In a tripartite

agreement entered into between Lep Air, Rolloswin and Mr Moschi for payments by

Rolloswin of sums due to Lep Air, Mr Moschi had (to quote the words used in cl XIII

of the agreement):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"… personally guaranteed the performance by Rolloswin

  Investments Limited of its obligation to make the payments at the rate of 6,000 per week

  together with the final payment of 4,000 as hereinbefore set out so however that Mr

  Moschi’s total obligation under this guarantee shall not exceed the total sum of

  40,000 …".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Rolloswin failed to pay the instalments agreed upon and on 22 December

1967 Lep Air brought the agreement to pay by instalments to an end on the grounds of

fundamental breach. Rolloswin subsequently went into liquidation and Lep Air sued Mr

Moschi under the guarantee contained in the tripartite agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    One of the arguments raised by Mr Moschi was that in cl XIII he

merely guaranteed that each instalment of 6,000 shall be paid. It was Mr Moschi’s

case that, since by reason of Lep Air accepting the repudiation of the contract by

Rolloswin, the contract had been brought to an end, the later instalments were no longer

payable and the only claim that Lep Air had against Rolloswin was for damages. It was

argued for Mr Moschi that he was not liable for the claim against Rolloswin for damages as

that was not a claim guaranteed by Mr Moschi. It was argued for Mr Moschi that if the

creditor chooses or acts in such a way that future instalments were not payable by the

debtor, the creditor cannot recover these instalments from Mr Moschi.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    To meet this argument, it was first necessary for the House of

Lords to determine what exactly Mr Moschi had undertaken to do. It is interesting to

note that Lord Reid prefaced that task by saying:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"I would not proceed by saying this is a contract of guarantee and

  there is a general rule applicable to all guarantees. Parties are free to make any

  agreement they like and we must I think determine just what this agreement means."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Lord Reid then went on to say that in making good to the creditor

payments of instalments by the principal debtor there were at least two possible forms of

agreement. He summarised these two forms (at pages 344 and 345) as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) A person might undertake no more than that if the principal debtor

  fails to pay any instalment he will pay it. That would be a conditional agreement. There

  would be no prestable obligation unless and until the debtor failed to pay. There would

  then on the debtor's failure arise an obligation to pay. If for any reason the debtor

  ceased to have any obligation to pay the instalment on the due date then he could not fail

  to pay it on that date. The condition attached to the undertaking would never be purified

  and the subsidiary obligation would never arise.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) On the other hand, the guarantor’s obligation might be of a

  different kind. He might <i>undertake</i> that the principal debtor will carry out his

  contract. Then if at any time and for any reason the principal debtor acts or fails to act

  as required by his contract, he not only breaks his own contract but he also puts the

  guarantor in breach of his contract of guarantee. Then the creditor can sue the guarantor,

  not for the unpaid instalment but for damages. His contract being that the principal

  debtor would carry out the principal contract, the damages payable by the guarantor must

  then be the loss suffered by the creditor due to the principal debtor having failed to do

  what the guarantor undertook that he would do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Lord Reid considered the <i>Moschi</i> contract to be one that fell

within (b) above.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    Having set out the above classification, Lord Reid went on to

say:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In my view, the appellant’s contract is of the latter type.

  He ‘personally guaranteed the performance’ by the company ‘of its

  obligation to make the payments at the rate of 6,000 per week.’ The rest of the

  clause does not alter that obligation. So he was in breach of his contract as soon as the

  company fell into arrears with its payment of the instalments. The guarantor, the

  appellant, then became liable to the creditor, the respondents, in damages. Those damages

  were the loss suffered by the creditor by reason of the company’s breach. It is not

  and could not be suggested that by accepting the company’s repudiation the creditor

  in any way increased his loss. The creditor lost more than the maximum which the appellant

  guaranteed and it appears to me that the whole loss was caused by the debtor having failed

  to carry out his contract. That being so, the appellant became liable to pay as damages

  for his breach of contract of guarantee the whole loss up to the maximum of

  40,000."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Having made the above analysis, Lord Reid went on to say that he would

not refer in detail to the authorities on the matter as it never seemed to have been

necessary to make a full analysis of the position of a contract of this kind – but

noted that the cases show that there was no magic in the word "guarantee" and

that most contracts of guarantee fall within (b). He concluded his judgment by stating:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The appellant as guarantor had undertaken that the company would

  carry out its contract so the damages which the company have not paid were part of the

  loss flowing from the appellant’s breach of contract for which the appellant is

  liable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">27.    Lord Diplock, in his speech, took a similar view. He stated at

page 348A:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"By the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century it appears to

  have been taken for granted, without need for any citation of authority, that the

  contractual promise of a guarantor to guarantee the performance by a debtor of his

  obligations to a creditor arising out of contract gave rise to an obligation on the part

  of the guarantor to <i>see to it</i> that the debtor performed his own obligations to the

  creditor.</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">It is because the obligation of the guarantor is to <i>see to it</i>

  that the debtor performed his own obligations to the creditor that the guarantor is not

  entitled to notice from the creditor of the debtor’s failure to perform an obligation

  which is the subject of the guarantee, and that the creditor’s cause of action

  against the guarantor arises at the moment of the debtor’s default and the limitation

  period then starts to run."</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">It follows from the legal nature of the obligation of the guarantor to

  which a contract of guarantee gives rise that it is not an obligation himself to pay a sum

  of money to the creditor, but an obligation <i>to see to</i> it that another person, the

  debtor, does something; and that the creditor’s remedy for the guarantor’s

  failure to perform it lies in damages for breach of contract only."</p>
<p align="justify">(Emphasis added.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">And at page 349A he goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The legal consequence of this is that whenever the debtor has

  failed voluntarily to perform an obligation which is the subject of the guarantee the

  creditor can recover from the guarantor as damages for breach of his contract whatever sum

  the creditor could have recovered from the debtor himself as a consequence of that

  failure. The debtor’s liability to the creditor is also the measure of the

  guarantor’s."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">28.    When Tan agreed to "procure" that the Company repays

the intercompany loans, he was in effect saying, that he – to use the language used

by Lord Reid – "undertook" that the Company would carry out its contract or

– to use the words of Lord Diplock – Tan had by cl 15 agreed to "see to

it" that the Company would carry out its contract. Mr BT Tan submitted that <i>Moschi’s</i>

case can be distinguished. He submitted that in that case it was not in dispute that

Mr Moschi had, in the tripatrite agreement, in so many words guaranteed that Rolloswin

would perform its obligation. In the present case, however, there was no reference to any

guarantee in cl 15. Mr BT Tan submitted that in <i>Moschi’s</i> case the fact that

the document was in terms a guarantee was accepted and what the court was concerned with

was how to interpret that guarantee in the light of the facts of that case.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    The lack of the word "guarantee" in cl 15 does not, in

my view, detract from the obligation imposed by that clause on Tan. It is relevant, in

this context, to note the statement by Lord Reid (referred to in paragraph 26 above) that

there was no magic in the word "guarantee" and that parties are free to make any

agreements that they like and it is for the court to determine just what the agreement

means. The undertaking of Tan that he would "procure" that the Company paid its

intercompany loans imposed an obligation on Tan to ensure or see to it that the Company

paid off the loans. Tan did not deliver on this obligation. He was therefore in breach of

cl 15. The question therefore arises as to what the measure of damages for that breach of

obligation should be.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    Mr Chia, relying on the passages in the <i>Moschi</i> case quoted

above submitted that the damages payable would be the total instalment payments due to

L&amp;M from the Company in respect of the intercompany loans the payment of which Tan had

failed to procure. Mr BT Tan did not dispute that failure by the Company to pay the

instalments agreed to in respect of the intercompany loans constituted a breach by Tan of

his obligation in cl 15 to "procure" that the Company repaid its intercompany

loans but submitted that the measure of damages would not be the instalments that the

Company had defaulted in paying but would be of an amount that the court would have to

assess bearing in mind the duty of the party claiming compensation to mitigate its loss.

Mr BT Tan pointed out that there was no evidence of L&amp;M having taken any proceedings

against the Company to recover the outstandings.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    If that submission by Mr BT Tan is upheld, the effect would be

that the obligation that Tan had taken upon himself in cl 15 to procure that the

intercompany loans are paid to L&amp;M would be shifted from Tan to L&amp;M. Such a result

would be a negation of cl 15 and for that reason I reject it. It is also established

law that a plaintiff need not take steps to recover compensation for his loss from parties

who, in addition to the defendant, are liable to him (see <i>McGregor on Damages</i>, 16<sup>th</sup>

Ed, paragraph 329). Following the reasoning of Lord Reid in the <i>Moschi</i> case set out

in paragraph 26 above and the approach taken by Lord Diplock at page 349A of the report

(quoted in paragraph 27 above), I am of the view that the proper basis for the assessment

of damages payable by Tan for the breach of his obligation under cl 15 would be the amount

that was due from the Company to L&amp;M. In this case, at the time of the writ, two

instalments were outstanding and the amount was $440,000.</p>
<p xmlns="">32.    L&amp;M have, in this case, admitted liability to the

plaintiff’s claims under cl 14 to the sum of $285,900. Tan’s only dispute on

L&amp;M’s counterclaim of $751.504.13 was as to his liability in respect of the

instalments (totalling $440,000) payable by the Company. On this I have ruled that Tan is

liable for the said sum under cl 15 of the Agreement. L&amp;M therefore succeed in their

counterclaim. Giving credit for the $285,900 admitted by L&amp;M the net result is that

there is a sum of $465,604.13 due from Tan to L&amp;M and I grant judgment in favour of

L&amp;M for the said amount with costs (of both claim and counterclaim).</p>
