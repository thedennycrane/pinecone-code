<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This action concerns claims made by a
                    plaintiff-customer against a defendant-bank for a loss of shares placed in the
                    plaintiff’s account with the defendant. The writ in this action was filed
                    on 9 May 2012. The claims are made on the basis of an alleged breach of the
                    defendant’s mandate with the plaintiff, and for the defendant’s
                    alleged breach of its duty to take reasonable care. The defendant has also
                    brought proceedings against the third party for an indemnity or contribution on
                    the basis that any breach of duty owed to the plaintiff was caused by the
                    misrepresentation of the third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Telemedia Pacific Group Limited
                    (“Telemedia”), is a company incorporated in the British Virgin
                    Islands (“BVI”). Telemedia is wholly-owned by Hardy Hartanto
                    (“Mr Hartanto”), a citizen of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
                    Region (“Hong Kong SAR”). Mr Hartanto is also the sole
                    director of Telemedia. Telemedia was an account holder with the Singapore branch
                    of the defendant, Crédit Agricole (Suisse) SA (“Crédit Agricole”),
                    a Swiss bank. The account was opened on 2 December 2010. I shall refer to
                    it as “the Telemedia Account”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Telemedia held 225m Next Generation Satellite
                    Communications Ltd (“NexGen”) shares in the Telemedia Account.
                    NexGen is a company listed on the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”).
                    (NexGen was previously known as Ban Joo &amp; Company Limited, and there was
                    some reference to a company by that name in the evidence. For convenience, I
                    will only use the name NexGen to refer to that company or its shares.) At the
                    material time, about 60% of NexGen’s issued share capital was held by
                    Telemedia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In October 2011, Crédit Agricole transferred the
                    NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account on the instructions of the third
                    party, Yeh Mao-Yuan, also known as Jack Yeh (“Mr Yeh”).
                    Mr Yeh is a citizen of the Republic of China (Taiwan) who travels on a
                    Dominica passport. He was also a business associate of Mr Hartanto. The
                    Telemedia Account was in fact opened pursuant to a joint-investment arrangement
                    between Mr Yeh and Mr Hartanto. Mr Yeh was the person who
                    instructed that the 225m NexGen shares be transferred out of the Telemedia
                    Account into an account maintained by Fullerton Capital Enterprises Limited
                    (“Fullerton”). Fullerton was a subsidiary of Yuanta Asset
                    Management International Limited (“Yuanta”), which was in turn
                    owned by Mr Yeh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Telemedia claims that Crédit Agricole was not
                    authorised to act on the instructions of Mr Yeh. It submits that Crédit
                    Agricole had, by effecting the transfers of the 225m NexGen shares pursuant to
                    Mr Yeh’s instructions, acted in breach of its mandate, or
                    alternatively, its duty of care owed to Telemedia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Crédit Agricole’s position is that
                    Mr Yeh was singly authorised to operate the Telemedia Account. Crédit
                    Agricole points to the account-opening forms and supporting documents which were
                    submitted pursuant to the opening of the Telemedia Account. These forms
                    constitute the contractual documents establishing the banker-customer
                    relationship between Crédit Agricole and Telemedia. The forms show <em>both</em> the names and signatures of Mr Yeh and
                    Mr Hartanto and reflect both of them as being singly authorised to provide
                    instructions to Crédit Agricole in respect of the Telemedia
                Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Telemedia challenges the circumstances under
                    which Mr Yeh’s name and signature came to appear on the
                    account-opening forms. Telemedia’s position is that Mr Hartanto was
                    the sole authorised signatory in respect of the Telemedia Account. Telemedia
                    alleges that a Crédit Agricole banker, Brian Goh (“Mr Goh”),
                    handed the account-opening forms to Mr Yeh after Mr Hartanto had
                    signed and returned the forms to Crédit Agricole. Mr Goh purportedly handed
                    the forms to Mr Yeh without Mr Hartanto’s knowledge or consent.
                    Telemedia claims that Mr Goh’s handing over of the account-opening
                    forms to Mr Yeh allowed Mr Yeh to affix his signature on the forms. At
                    the material time, Mr Goh was a director at the Singapore branch of Crédit
                    Agricole’s private banking arm. He was the private banker responsible for
                    managing Telemedia’s banking relationship with Crédit
                Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Crédit Agricole disputes Telemedia’s
                    version of events. Crédit Agricole’s position is that the agreement or
                    understanding between Mr Hartanto, Mr Yeh and Mr Goh had been
                    that both Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh would be singly authorised to operate
                    the Telemedia Account. Crédit Agricole’s position is that when the
                    completed account-opening forms were handed to Mr Goh, the forms bore the
                    names and signatures of both Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh, consistent with
                    the understanding between the three of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Crédit Agricole also commenced third-party
                    proceedings against Mr Yeh, seeking an indemnity from him in the event that
                    Crédit Agricole is found liable. Crédit Agricole’s claim against
                    Mr Yeh, which is predicated on the success of Telemedia’s claim
                    against it, is that Mr Yeh had fraudulently misrepresented to Crédit
                    Agricole that he was singly authorised to operate the Telemedia Account. Crédit
                    Agricole alleges that it had been induced by those misrepresentations to
                    transfer the 225m NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account on
                    Mr Yeh’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is important to bear in mind two features
                    of the present proceedings. First, Telemedia’s claim is against Crédit
                    Agricole and <em>not</em> Mr Yeh. No claim was brought
                    by Telemedia against Mr Yeh in respect of his alleged unauthorised
                    instruction to Crédit Agricole to transfer 225m shares out of the Telemedia
                    Account. This is, at least on the face it, bizarre. Based on Telemedia’s
                    version of events given in these proceedings, Mr Yeh would have been the
                    main antagonist—he would have been the fraudster who covertly inserted his
                    name into the account-opening forms without Telemedia’s knowledge or
                    consent. But Mr Yeh is party to these proceedings only because <em>Crédit Agricole</em> took out third-party proceedings against
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     To date, neither Telemedia nor
                    Mr Hartanto has instituted legal proceedings against Mr Yeh. Neither
                    does it appear that any police report has been lodged against
                        Mr Yeh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In cross-examination,
                    Mr Hartanto appeared to agree that it was his case that Mr Yeh had
                    defrauded him in respect of the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares (at the very
                    least to have instructed the transfer of shares without authority). Accordingly,
                    his complaint in this suit against Crédit Agricole was made on the basis that
                    Mr Goh and Mr Yeh had ganged up against him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Mr Hartanto’s evidence was,
                    however, peculiar, as he appeared to hold the view that the fault lay entirely
                    on Crédit Agricole, and that Telemedia <em>might not even have a
                        cause of action against Mr Yeh</em>. While I accept that it is
                    Telemedia’s (or Mr Hartanto’s) sole prerogative as to who to
                    bring proceedings against, and for what, it is still surprising, given the
                    nature of the allegations made by Telemedia in this suit, that neither Telemedia
                    nor Mr Hartanto has initiated an action against Mr Yeh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Second, Telemedia’s claim against Crédit
                    Agricole is premised entirely on the fact that Crédit Agricole’s transfer
                    of the 225m NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account was effected either
                    without authority or in breach of its duty of care. There is no allegation of
                    fraud, notice of fraud or conspiracy made against Crédit Agricole or
                    Mr Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The nub of the dispute is whether Mr Yeh
                    was singly authorised to give instructions in relation to the Telemedia Account.
                    This requires a determination of how Mr Yeh’s name and signature
                    found its way onto the Telemedia account-opening forms. If Mr Yeh was
                    authorised to give instructions in relation to the Telemedia Account, the
                    further question that arises is whether Telemedia validly revoked
                    Mr Yeh’s authority prior to the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares
                    out of the Telemedia Account in October 2011. Before addressing these factual
                    and legal disputes, I will begin by tracing the largely undisputed
                facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The introduction of Mr Hartanto to Mr Yeh and preliminary
                talks</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The origins of the dispute date back to 2005.
                    That was the first time Mr Hartanto was introduced to Mr Yeh in
                    Shenzhen, the People’s Republic of China. They then met again in July or
                    August 2010 at Marina Bay Sands (“MBS”) in Singapore. At this
                    meeting, Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh discussed the possibility of both of
                    them entering into a joint investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The joint investment: the non-recourse loan agreements and securities
                co-operation agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After subsequent meetings and discussions, the
                    skeleton of the joint investment took shape. The plan was for Mr Hartanto
                    and Mr Yeh to invest through the vehicle of a BVI company. The company
                    eventually selected was Asia Energy Management Ltd (“Asia
                    Energy”). Mr Hartanto claims that the entity Asia Energy was not
                    selected till a much more advanced stage in the finalisation of the
                    joint-investment arrangement. I will come back to this point later. Both
                    Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh also acted through their respective companies,
                    Telemedia and Yuanta, in respect of the joint investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The joint-investment arrangement required both
                    Telemedia and Asia Energy to open individual accounts with Crédit Agricole. The
                    arrangement was structured in two stages. The first stage concerned the
                    procurement of financing for Asia Energy. The second stage concerned the actual
                    joint investments made by Asia Energy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Under the first stage, Yuanta was to advance
                    loans to Asia Energy on the collateral of NexGen shares. These NexGen shares
                    were to be provided by Telemedia. Under the precise mechanics of the
                    arrangement, the NexGen shares would be held in the Telemedia Account. Yuanta
                    would disburse loan monies (which it procured from third-party lenders) to Asia
                    Energy’s account with Crédit Agricole (“the Asia Energy
                    Account”) against the transfer of NexGen shares from the Telemedia
                    Account into Yuanta’s account with Crédit Agricole (“the Yuanta
                    Account”). The loan amount to be disbursed to Asia Energy was to be
                    50–55% of the value of the collateralised NexGen shares. On top of that,
                    Yuanta would also charge a 10% service fee for the provision of the loans to
                    Asia Energy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Yuanta was given broad powers to deal with the
                    NexGen shares pledged as security for the loans to Asia Energy. Yuanta was
                    entitled to sell, trade or pledge the collateralised NexGen shares at its
                    discretion. It was entitled to hold or deposit the shares with any local or
                    overseas depository institution or liquidation company, issuers of securities
                    without certificates and custodians at any local or overseas bank or custodian
                    centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the event that the value of the pledged
                    NexGen shares fell below 55% of the loan amount that they secured (this was
                    referred to as a “valuation event”), Telemedia would be required
                    to repay the loan immediately, or to restore the value of the collateral pledged
                    to Yuanta by transferring additional NexGen shares from the Telemedia Account
                    into the Yuanta Account. This provision was important because NexGen was on the
                    SGX watch list at the time of the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The second stage of the joint-investment
                    arrangement concerned the actual investments that were made through Asia Energy.
                    The loans from Yuanta to Asia Energy would be applied to investments. The
                    profits and losses from these investments were to be shared equally between
                    Telemedia and Yuanta.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The two-part joint-investment arrangement
                    described above was encapsulated in three written agreements: the first and
                    second non-recourse loan agreements (“the NRLs”), both dated
                    14 November 2010; and the supplementary securities cooperation agreement
                    (“the SCA”), dated 15 November 2010. These three agreements
                    were in Mandarin, but translations were provided for the purposes of the trial.
                    There was a dispute as to when (14 or 15 November 2010) and where (Hong
                    Kong SAR or Shenzhen) these agreements were signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The opening of the Telemedia Account and Asia Energy
                Account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It will be recalled that the joint-investment
                    arrangement required Telemedia and Asia Energy to open accounts at Crédit
                    Agricole. The circumstances surrounding and leading up to the opening of the
                    Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account are the subject of sharp disagreement
                    between Telemedia and Crédit Agricole/Mr Yeh. Both their competing version
                    of events will be addressed in detail below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It suffices to say at this point that
                    Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh met with Mr Goh at the premises of the
                    Crédit Agricole Singapore branch in early October 2010. This meeting related
                    broadly to the joint-investment arrangement, although the specifics of what
                    transpired are hotly disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is undisputed that Mr Goh handed over
                    the account-opening forms for the Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account to
                    Mr Hartanto either at or after this first meeting at the Crédit Agricole
                    premises. It is also undisputed that the account-opening forms were eventually
                    completed and returned to Crédit Agricole. When and how each of these events
                    occurred, however, is the subject of considerable controversy, and forms the nub
                    of the factual dispute between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The account-opening forms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I will now give a brief description of the
                    Telemedia account-opening forms, which are central to this dispute. These forms
                    make up the terms of the banker-customer relationship between Crédit Agricole
                    and Telemedia. The forms comprised a few sets of loose documents. Three sets of
                    these documents are of relevance: (a) the “Application to Establish
                    Relations” form; (b) the “Certified Extract of Board
                    Resolution” form; and (c) the “Acknowledgement Crédit
                    Agricole’s General Conditions” form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Each of these documents was dated
                    30 November 2010. The dates on each of these forms were filled in by Joanne
                    Teo (“Ms Teo”). Ms Teo was Mr Goh’s assistant. She
                    prepared the account-opening forms by filling up the main portions of the forms,
                    such as the details of Telemedia, the names, nationalities and dates of birth of
                    the persons authorised to act as directors, <em>etc</em>.
                    She drew a small cross or used “sign here” stickers to indicate
                    the blanks which Mr Hartanto and/or Mr Yeh were required to sign
                    on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the Application to Establish Relations
                    form, both Mr Hartanto’s and Mr Yeh’s names were listed
                    under the “Initial Authorised Signatures”. The “Initial
                    Authorised Signatures” are:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]he persons ... duly authorised to execute and deliver any documents on

                        provide instructions to the Bank in respect of any matter relating to the
                        above account(s) ... with no restrictions or conditions other than those, if
                        any, set below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>No restrictions and conditions were set out. Both persons were
                        stated to be singly authorised to operate the Telemedia Account. The names
                        of Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh, as well as the “singly”
                        designation were written in the hand of Ms Teo.
                        Mr Hartanto’s and Mr Yeh’s signatures appeared next to
                        their names. No person signed off as a witness to this
                    document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The next document is the Certified Extract of
                    Board Resolution form. This document sets forth a Telemedia board resolution
                    which states that Telemedia is authorised to enter into business relations with
                    Crédit Agricole. Under the section of the board resolution titled
                    “Authorised Person(s)”, the names of Mr Hartanto and
                    Mr Yeh are filled in; both are stipulated to be singly authorised to
                    instruct Crédit Agricole on behalf of Telemedia. The names of Mr Hartanto
                    and Mr Yeh, as well as the “singly” designation, were written
                    in the hand of Ms Teo. The document states that it constitutes
                    Telemedia’s mandate to Crédit Agricole and that the mandate will remain in
                    force and effect until an amending resolution is passed by the directors of
                    Telemedia. The Certified Extract of Board Resolution form was signed by
                    Mr Hartanto as a director of Telemedia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The final document is the Acknowledgement of
                    Crédit Agricole’s General Conditions form. The form acknowledges that the
                    undersigned has received a copy of the Crédit Agricole’s General
                    Conditions, which is appended to the back of the form. This document was signed
                    by Mr Hartanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Telemedia claims that Mr Yeh’s name
                    and signature on the Application to Establish Relations and Certified Extract of
                    Board Resolution forms were inserted only <em>after</em>
                    the completed forms were handed to Crédit Agricole. Crédit Agricole claims that
                    both Mr Hartanto’s and Mr Yeh’s names and signatures were
                    present on the completed account-opening forms when they were
                received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I pause to mention that there is a similar set
                    of account-opening forms in respect of the Asia Energy Account. I need not go
                    into them in detail. It is undisputed that both sets of forms (one for the
                    Telemedia Account and one for the Asia Energy Account) were handed to
                    Mr Hartanto together, and were returned to Crédit Agricole together. There
                    are, however, two material differences between the Telemedia account-opening
                    forms and the Asia Energy account-opening forms. The first is that the Asia
                    Energy account-opening forms bore the signature of a third
                    person—Mr Supriadi—who was Mr Hartanto’s nominee for
                    Asia Energy. The second is that Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh were authorised
                    to operate the Asia Energy Account jointly (this is undisputed) rather than
                    singly, as appears to be the case on the face of the Telemedia account-opening
                    forms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The valuation event under the NRLs and the SCA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     After the Telemedia and the Asia Energy
                    accounts were opened on 2 December 2010, the joint-investment arrangement
                    was set in motion. Yuanta procured financing from a third-party lender between
                    February and June 2011. The total sum of financing procured was approximately
                    S$12,936,852. The monies were transferred from the Yuanta Account to the Asia
                    Energy Account in ten tranches. This took place against the simultaneous
                    transfer of 765m NexGen shares, also in ten tranches, as security from the
                    Telemedia Account to the Yuanta Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is not disputed that the transfer of these
                    ten tranches of NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account were on the
                    instructions of Mr Hartanto. It is also clear that Mr Yeh did not sign
                    off, singly or otherwise, on these ten tranches of share transfers. With the
                    transfer of the 765m NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account, a residual 225m
                    NexGen shares was left in the Telemedia Account. This remainder of 225m NexGen
                    shares are those which Telemedia complains were transferred out of the Telemedia
                    Account without authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The value of the pledged 765m NexGen shares
                    fell subsequent to their transfer. This triggered a valuation event under the
                    NRLs and the SCA. Top-up notices and reminders were issued by Yuanta to
                    Telemedia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     While the issues before this court did not
                    concern the earlier transfer of 765m NexGen shares in ten tranches, evidence was
                    nonetheless led on the point. This was for the purpose of illustrating how the
                    agreements and understanding between Telemedia, Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh
                    operated. There is no doubt that the transfer of the 765m NexGen shares occurred
                    and that they were transferred on the sole instructions of
                    Mr Hartanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     There was also a suggestion in the evidence
                    that the funds raised were used solely by Mr Hartanto, in breach of the
                    agreement in the NRLs and SCA that the funds were to be applied to joint
                    investments. This dispute, however, is not concerned with breaches under those
                    agreements and I will not address it any further.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The attempted transfer of the NexGen shares out of the Telemedia
                Account in September 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On 8 September 2011, Mr Yeh
                    instructed Crédit Agricole to transfer the remaining 225m NexGen shares out of
                    the Telemedia Account into the Yuanta Account. Mr Yeh also emailed
                    Mr Hartanto (copying Mr Goh) on the same day, informing him that he
                    had issued instructions for the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares. The email
                    also reminded Mr Hartanto to make the necessary announcement on the SGX.
                    Mr Yeh ended off the email by instructing Mr Goh to transfer the 225m
                    NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account “immediately”.
                    Mr Hartanto did not respond to Mr Yeh’s email dated
                    8 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On 12 September 2011, Mr Goh asked
                    Ms Teo, his assistant, to contact Mr Hartanto to inform him of the
                    transfer instructions that had been received from Mr Yeh. Mr Goh
                    stated that even though Mr Yeh was singly authorised to sign for the
                    Telemedia Account, he wanted to inform Mr Hartanto of the transfer as a
                    matter of client relationship management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Ms Teo attempted to telephone
                    Mr Hartanto but was unsuccessful. She then sent an email to
                    Mr Hartanto informing him that Crédit Agricole will be making the transfer
                    and reminding him to make the necessary SGX announcement. An exchange of emails
                    followed. I will examine the correspondence in detail later. In summary,
                    Mr Hartanto’s position in his emails to Ms Teo was that
                    Mr Yeh was not a signatory for the Telemedia Account. Mr Hartanto sent
                    a final email on 12 September 2011 stating that he had telephoned
                    Mr Yeh, and agreed that they will transfer the 225m NexGen shares out of
                    the Telemedia Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Mr Hartanto also claimed in his affidavit
                    of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) that he had telephoned Ms Teo
                    in the midst of the email exchange. In that telephone conversation, Ms Teo
                    purportedly promised not to make transfers until further instructions were
                    received from Mr Hartanto. Ms Teo claimed that there was no such
                    telephone call.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Ms Teo responded to the final email
                    Mr Hartanto sent on 12 September 2011 the next day (13 September
                    2011). She also emailed Mr Hartanto a draft written instruction to effect
                    the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares from the Telemedia Account to the Asia
                    Energy Account for Mr Hartanto to sign and return (pursuant to
                    Mr Hartanto’s final email sent on 12 September 2011).
                    Mr Hartanto did not, however, sign and return the form. The transfer of the
                    NexGen shares was therefore not effected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The actual transfer of the NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account
                in October 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On 6 October 2011, Mr Yeh issued
                    instructions to Crédit Agricole to transfer 112.5m NexGen shares out of the
                    Telemedia Account into Fullerton’s account at Crédit Agricole (“the
                    Fullerton Account”). Mr Goh and Ms Teo claimed that they made
                    attempts to contact Mr Hartanto to inform him of this, and to remind him to
                    make the necessary SGX announcements, but that they were unable to reach
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On 10 October 2011, Ms Teo called
                    Mr Yeh in relation to his transfer instructions that he provided on
                    6 October 2011. The telephone call was recorded and a transcript was
                    produced in court. Ms Teo told Mr Yeh to remind Mr Hartanto to
                    make the necessary SGX announcements because Mr Yeh was a signatory under
                    the account and because it was Mr Yeh who signed the transfer
                    instruction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On that same day, Mr Yeh issued another
                    written instruction to transfer the remaining 112.5m shares out of the Telemedia
                    Account and into the Fullerton Account. Mr Goh and Ms Teo claimed that
                    they made attempts to contact Mr Hartanto to inform him of this and to
                    remind him to make the necessary SGX announcements, but that they were unable to
                    reach him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On 14 October 2011, Ms Teo called
                    Mr Yeh at about 4.34pm and 4.36pm. She made the calls to confirm
                    Mr Yeh’s 10 October 2011 transfer instruction and to remind him
                    that the SGX announcement had to be made. The second telephone conversation also
                    alluded to the fact that Mr Hartanto had not made an announcement in
                    respect of the previous transfer of shares. Mr Yeh responded by saying that
                    he had already informed Mr Hartanto to do so and that it was
                    Mr Hartanto’s responsibility to make the announcements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Crédit Agricole purportedly sent transaction
                    advices to Telemedia informing it of each of the above share transfers on 11 and
                    17 October 2011 respectively. Mr Hartanto denied receiving any such
                    transaction advices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The post-transfer confusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Telemedia Account was left with a
                    zero-balance following the transfer out of the 225m NexGen shares in October
                    2011. Crédit Agricole issued a letter on 28 October 2011 informing
                    Mr Hartanto of the zero-balance in the Telemedia Account. The letter stated
                    that the account would be closed within 30 days in the absence of instructions
                    to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Ms Teo followed up with an email to
                    Mr Hartanto on 31 October 2011. The email appended the letter and
                    asked for instructions on the closure of the Telemedia Account. Mr Hartanto
                    responded to Ms Teo’s email on the same day, requesting a
                    confirmation that the 225m NexGen shares were still held in the Telemedia
                    Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     An exchange of emails between Mr Hartanto
                    and Mr Goh ensued. On 1 November 2011, Mr Goh emailed
                    Mr Hartanto, reminding him that the 225m NexGen shares had already been
                    transferred out of the Telemedia Account. Mr Hartanto replied, asking for
                    copies of the transfer instructions. Mr Goh responded with copies of the
                    Application to Establish Relations form and the share transfer instructions
                    issued by Mr Yeh on 6 and 10 October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Mr Hartanto emailed Mr Goh on
                    3 November 2011, stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Brian,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am very clear that [Telemedia] or me, never gave Jack Yeh as
                        authorize signature at the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Especially singly signature?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You need the board resolution for it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You know for [Asia Energy] the JV with my partner, he is not singly
                        signature, it require joint signature?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pls clarify, how the paper become like that?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I need the 225m shares back to [the Telemedia Account].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Joanne, your assistant, email us to sign the transfer, which I reject
                        already.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When she said that Jack is the authorized signature, I reply her already
                        that he is not authorize signature. Then no reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">How come now, the shares transfer to [Yuanta], and he is the authorize
                        signature?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Brian, this is no good.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">HH</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Mr Goh responded on the same day, stating
                    that the Telemedia account-opening forms made it clear that Mr Yeh was a
                    singly authorised signatory. Mr Goh also offered to arrange a meeting
                    between Mr Hartanto, Mr Yeh and himself before any disagreement arose.
                    This meeting never materialised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     On 15 November 2011, Mr Goh sent an
                    email to Mr Hartanto which stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear [Mr Hartanto],</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">as per our earlier conversation, I am replying your queries via
                        email</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. Account opening.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We received your account opening forms without proof of beneficial owner
                        and the account opening was delayed by 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whilst pending the beneficial owner proof from you, all forms were handed
                        over to Mr Jack Yeh, your business partner and introducer to the
                        bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When all relevant forms and proof of ownership was furnished to us, the
                        signatory of [Telemedia] included yourself and Mr Jack Yeh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The account was opened in accordance to the paperwork furnished.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our bank does not require a separate board meeting or board resolution
                        prior to account opening to have an additional signatory for the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     According to Mr Hartanto, this email came
                    as a shock to him. He claimed that this was the first time he was informed that
                    the account-opening forms had been handed to Mr Yeh. He claimed that he had
                    never been informed that Mr Yeh was included as a singly authorised
                    signatory. He claimed that this was done without his knowledge or
                    authorisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Hartanto’s response came more
                    than a month later, in the form of a letter dated 30 December 2011 written
                    under Telemedia’s letterhead. The length of time taken for the response is
                    surprising. The letter stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    I am the Sole director and authorized signer of the
                            Company.</p>

                            account. Therefore, all acceptance of instruction from him after Sept.
                            was both unreasonable and unauthorized.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    We are requested your bank remedy these mistakes
                            and give us a satisfactory answer within 7 days from date of the letter.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Goh responded by email on
                    4 January 2012. He stated that he was not going to address
                    Mr Hartanto’s concerns point by point. He nonetheless stated that
                    Crédit Agricole has “never been involved in the loan agreements or
                    transactions between yourself and [Mr Yeh]”. Mr Goh also
                    proposed a tripartite meeting between Mr Hartanto, Mr Yeh and himself
                    to resolve the issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The termination of Mr Goh from the employment of Crédit
                Agricole</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     On 30 March 2012, Mr Goh was
                    terminated from the employment of Crédit Agricole. The termination letter from
                    Crédit Agricole stated that the reason for Mr Goh’s termination was
                    his failure to “escalate [his] client’s complaints to Management
                    despite having been notified and reminded by [his] clients on numerous
                    occasions”. He had “breached paragraph 2.4.4 of Directive 05.01 on
                    Clients Complaints, whereby “Any client complaint that is not reported
                    will be considered to be an instance of professional misconduct”.”
                    The letter went on to state that Mr Goh’s failure to do so was
                    “considered ... a serious breach of internal policy”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The removal of Mr Yeh as an authorised signatory of the
                Telemedia Account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In May 2013, Crédit Agricole wrote to
                    Telemedia informing them that Mr Yeh was still a singly authorised
                    signatory for the Telemedia Account, and that unless he was removed, Crédit
                    Agricole would have to continue taking instructions from him in accordance with
                    their mandate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Telemedia responded on 3 June 2013 by way
                    of a letter appending a Telemedia board resolution to that effect. The letter
                    was nonetheless written on a “without prejudice” basis and
                    asserted that “Jack Yeh was never the authorised signatory” and
                    that there was “absolutely no reason ... to pass a resolution to effect
                    the removal of Jack Yeh”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Crédit Agricole effected the removal of
                    Mr Yeh as a signatory of the Telemedia Account on 7 June
                2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     At the heart of the dispute lies how
                    Mr Yeh’s signature came to appear on the Telemedia account-opening
                    forms. Was his name inserted in accordance with an understanding between
                    Mr Hartanto, Mr Yeh and Mr Goh? Or did Mr Goh forward the
                    account-opening forms to Mr Yeh after they were signed and returned by
                    Mr Hartanto, such that Mr Yeh was able to insert his name and
                    signature without Mr Hartanto’s knowledge or consent?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The skeleton of events I have set out above
                    was based largely on the undisputed facts and documents. There is a surprising
                    dearth of contemporaneous evidence documenting the events leading up to the
                    opening of the Telemedia Account. The evidence provided by the witnesses at the
                    trial is therefore of particular importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The only witness for Telemedia was
                    Mr Hartanto. He gave evidence in English at the trial.
                    Mr Hartanto’s recollection of events was hazy. He also appeared
                    unfamiliar with the few documents that were placed before the court. Telemedia,
                    in its closing submissions, admits that Mr Hartanto’s evidence was
                    given “somewhat awkwardly”, that he was “not clear in his
                    recollection of dates” and that there were “lapses in [his]
                    memory”. Telemedia nonetheless submits that these factors “should
                    not be used to adversely construe the reliability of [Mr Hartanto] as a
                    credible witness”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Five witnesses gave evidence for Crédit
                    Agricole. The first was Mr Goh. At the time of the trial, Mr Goh was
                    no longer an employee of Crédit Agricole nor involved in the wealth management
                    or finance industry. He was managing a business involving backpackers’
                    hostels following his termination by Crédit Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Ms Teo was Crédit Agricole’s second
                    witness. She was Mr Goh’s assistant while he was still at Crédit
                    Agricole. Ms Teo was still an employee of Crédit Agricole at the time of
                    the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Denis Michon (“Mr Michon”) was
                    Crédit Agricole’s third witness. Mr Michon was the head of a
                    department within Crédit Agricole known as S2i Mailing for Crédit Agricole
                    (Suisse) SA in Geneva, Switzerland. He gave evidence on Crédit Agricole’s
                    internal system which managed customer information and generated statements of
                    account and transaction advices. The S2i Mailing department also mailed all S2i
                    documents worldwide, including Singapore. Mr Michon gave evidence that the
                    transaction advices relating to the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares were sent
                    to Mr Hartanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Tang Kai Ying, Sharon and Mark Nazzari Di
                    Calabiana Willan were Crédit Agricole’s fourth and fifth witnesses. Both
                    were transcribers engaged by Crédit Agricole to transcribe or translate certain
                    documents. Cross-examination for these two witnesses was dispensed
                with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The sole witness for the third party was
                    Mr Yeh himself. Mr Yeh elected to give his evidence through an
                    interpreter in Mandarin. The positions (in respect of the factual dispute)
                    adopted by Crédit Agricole and Mr Yeh were largely aligned. I will
                    therefore deal with their positions collectively, save for where there are
                    material differences in their positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The events leading up to the opening of the
                    Telemedia Account is the subject of deep disagreement between Telemedia and
                    Crédit Agricole. There are at least five points of dispute between both sides.
                    First, the number of meetings that Mr Hartanto, Mr Yeh and Mr Goh
                    attended at Crédit Agricole’s premises. Second, when the account-opening
                    forms were handed to Mr Hartanto and/or Mr Yeh. Third, when the
                    account-opening forms were filled up and signed, and by whom. Fourth, when
                    Mr Yeh appended his signature to the Telemedia account-opening form, and
                    whether this was done with the consent and in the presence of Mr Hartanto.
                    Fifth, whether the account-opening forms were handed to Mr Yeh without the
                    knowledge and consent of Mr Hartanto. I will begin by describing the two
                    competing sequences of events put forth by Telemedia and Crédit
                Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Telemedia’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first Crédit Agricole meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Mr Hartanto claimed that he was first
                    introduced to Mr Goh in October 2010 at the first meeting at Crédit
                    Agricole’s premises. Mr Hartanto’s position was that at the
                    first meeting, Mr Yeh and himself informed Mr Goh of their intention
                    to enter into a joint investment. Mr Hartanto claimed that the details and
                    structure of the joint investment were yet to be firmed up at the time of the
                    first meeting at Crédit Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Mr Hartanto’s evidence was that he
                    and Mr Yeh wanted to know the financing arrangements that Crédit Agricole
                    could provide. Mr Goh purportedly told them that it would be difficult for
                    Asia Energy to secure credit facilities from Crédit Agricole as it was not an
                    existing client. Mr Yeh then suggested that Yuanta raise the loan instead,
                    since Yuanta already had an existing credit facility with Crédit Agricole.
                    Mr Hartanto claimed that he was under the impression that the loans for
                    financing the joint investment would be provided by Crédit
                Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Mr Hartanto also claimed that there was a
                    discussion as to whether Yuanta had sufficient funds to acquire NexGen shares
                    for the purpose of the joint investment. Also broached was the topic of the
                    identity of the joint-venture vehicle to be used. Mr Hartanto claimed that
                    the identity of the joint-venture vehicle was still undecided at the time of the
                    first meeting at Crédit Agricole’s premises in October 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second Crédit Agricole meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mr Hartanto’s evidence was that a
                    second meeting was held at Crédit Agricole’s premises in early November
                    2010. Mr Hartanto claimed that Mr Goh handed him the account-opening
                    forms for the Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account at this
                meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Mr Hartanto’s evidence as to
                    whether he had signed some of the forms at this meeting is unclear. But it is
                    clear that he did not return the account-opening forms to Mr Goh at the
                    close of this meeting. Rather, he held on to them until the third meeting at
                    Crédit Agricole’s premises where he returned the completed forms to
                    Mr Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The meetings in Shenzhen/Hong Kong SAR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Mr Hartanto’s evidence was that
                    there was a meeting between himself and Mr Yeh in Shenzhen on
                    14 November 2010. Mr Goh was not present. The next day, there was
                    another meeting in Hong Kong SAR between Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh, where
                    they signed the NRLs and the SCA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The third Crédit Agricole meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Mr Hartanto claimed that there was a
                    third meeting at Crédit Agricole’s premises on or around 30 November
                    2010 (Mr Hartanto’s evidence as to the precise date of this meeting
                    was inconsistent). At this meeting, Mr Hartanto claimed that he signed the
                    account-opening forms and returned them to Mr Goh (subject to the
                    qualification above that Mr Hartanto may have already signed some of the
                    forms at the second Crédit Agricole meeting).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Telemedia’s case is that the Telemedia
                    account-opening forms only bore the name and signature of Mr Hartanto as
                    being singly authorised to operate the Telemedia Account when they were returned
                    to Mr Goh at the third Crédit Agricole meeting. Telemedia’s case is
                    that Mr Goh must have subsequently handed the forms to Mr Yeh, thereby
                    allowing Mr Yeh to affix his name and signature such that it would appear
                    that he was also singly authorised to operate the Telemedia
                Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Crédit Agricole’s position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The positions of Mr Yeh and Mr Goh
                    were largely similar. According to Mr Yeh and Mr Goh, there were only
                    two meetings held at Crédit Agricole’s premises (as opposed to
                    Mr Hartanto’s position that there were three).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first Crédit Agricole meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The first took place in October 2010. At that
                    meeting, Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh had already largely agreed on the
                    structure of the joint investment, including the rights of signing for the
                    Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account. The structure of the joint investment
                    and the rights of signing were agreed on in previous meetings between
                    Mr Hartanto, Mr Yeh and Mr Goh at MBS and Fullerton
                Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The Asia Energy Account was to be operated
                    jointly by Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh while the Telemedia Account was to
                    be operated singly by either of them. At the end of the first meeting,
                    Mr Goh handed the account-opening forms for both the Telemedia Account and
                    Asia Energy Account to Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     According to Mr Yeh, immediately after
                    this meeting, Mr Hartanto and he proceeded to MBS, where Mr Hartanto
                    signed the Telemedia account-opening forms, while Mr Yeh signed the Asia
                    Energy account-opening forms. Mr Hartanto then took the forms away for the
                    purpose of collating the remaining documents and obtaining
                    Mr Supriadi’s signature on the Asia Energy account-opening
                    forms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second Crédit Agricole meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Mr Yeh and Mr Goh claimed that there
                    was a second meeting held at Crédit Agricole’s premises in early November
                    2010. The meeting was for the purpose of opening the accounts. However,
                    Mr Hartanto had been unable to obtain all the requisite supporting
                    documents by that meeting. As a result, the meeting was a short
                one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     According to Mr Goh, at that meeting,
                    Mr Hartanto had placed all the account-opening forms and documents into an
                    envelope. Mr Hartanto informed Mr Goh that the documentation was
                    incomplete. Mr Yeh then volunteered to consolidate the documents and return
                    them. Mr Goh therefore handed the envelope over to Mr Yeh in the
                    presence of Mr Hartanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Mr Yeh’s evidence was that after
                    Mr Hartanto and himself had left Crédit Agricole’s premises, both of
                    them returned to Mr Yeh’s hotel. Mr Yeh Yeh examined the
                    documents and discovered that Mr Supriadi had yet to sign on the
                    account-opening forms for Asia Energy. Mr Yeh therefore handed the forms
                    back to Mr Hartanto for him to obtain Mr Supriadi’s signature
                    and to consolidate the remaining documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The meetings in Shenzhen/Hong Kong SAR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Mr Yeh’s evidence was that he met
                    Mr Hartanto in Shenzhen on 14 and 15 November 2010. At those meetings,
                    they signed the NRLs as well as the SCA. Further, both of them finalised the
                    account-opening forms for both the Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account.
                    According to Mr Yeh, Mr Hartanto again reiterated that Mr Yeh was
                    to be a singly authorised signatory for the Telemedia Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Mr Yeh claimed that once they resolved
                    the outstanding issues in Shenzhen, he kept the account-opening forms and
                    documents and couriered them to Mr Goh in Singapore on 15 November
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Mr Goh’s evidence was that he
                    received the forms by courier on 16 November 2010. He then passed the
                    completed forms to Ms Teo for review. Mr Goh noticed that Mr Yeh
                    was a singly authorised signatory on the Telemedia Account—this was
                    consistent with the impression or understanding that he had from the first
                    Crédit Agricole meeting, that both Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh were to be
                    able to operate the Telemedia Account singly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision on the factual issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The versions of events provided by both sides
                    are diametrically opposed. Their divergence is so sharp that either has to be
                    accepted or rejected in its entirety. There is no defensible middle ground
                    between both positions. It is my judgment that the version of events put forth
                    by Crédit Agricole and Mr Yeh is the correct one. I accept the evidence of
                    Mr Yeh and Mr Goh, and prefer it over Mr Hartanto’s. I make
                    this finding for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     First, Mr Hartanto’s evidence is
                    unsatisfactory. There were numerous and significant departures in
                    Mr Hartanto’s oral evidence from the position taken in
                    Telemedia’s pleadings and Mr Hartanto’s AEIC. Second,
                    Mr Hartanto’s position (or any of the few iterations of it) did not
                    cohere with the contemporaneous documentary evidence, in particular,
                    Ms Teo’s email to Mr Yeh dated 16 November 2010. Third,
                    Mr Hartanto’s half-hearted response when he discovered that
                    Mr Yeh was singly authorised to transfer shares out of the Telemedia
                    Account is consistent with the version of events given by Crédit Agricole and
                    Mr Yeh. I will address each in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As a preface to the discussion of these
                    reasons, I would point out that the upshot of Telemedia’s case and
                    Mr Hartanto’s evidence is that Mr Yeh had a small role, if any
                    at all, to play in the account-opening process. From the moment Mr Goh
                    handed the account-opening forms to Mr Hartanto, to the moment
                    Mr Hartanto returned the signed and completed forms back to Mr Goh,
                    Mr Yeh had little to do with the forms. Mr Yeh was not involved in the
                    collation of the various documents required for the opening of the Telemedia
                    Account and Asia Energy Account. He was also not involved in the completion of
                    the forms. All he did was pen his signature on the account-opening forms for the
                    Asia Energy Account in the presence of Mr Hartanto and Mr Goh. It will
                    be seen that this position is untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Telemedia’s position is compromised because of
                Mr Hartanto’s unsatisfactory evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Mr Hartanto’s eventual evidence was
                    that there were three meetings at Crédit Agricole’s premises. At the first
                    meeting in early October 2010, there were preliminary discussions between
                    himself, Mr Yeh and Mr Goh as to the structure of the joint
                    investment. At the second meeting in early November 2010, he was issued the
                    account-opening forms by Mr Goh. At the third meeting on or around 30
                    November 2010, he returned the account-opening forms to Mr Goh. This
                    position was reached, however, only after making a few significant shifts in the
                    course of his oral evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Telemedia’s pleaded position is that
                    there were only two meetings at Crédit Agricole’s premises. The first was
                    in October 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and the second on
                    30 November 2010. At the first meeting, preliminary discussions took place.
                    There was no talk of opening accounts or the handing over of any forms. At the
                    second meeting, Mr Goh handed two sets of account-opening forms to
                        Mr Hartanto.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Mr Hartanto
                    signed these forms in the presence of Mr Goh and returned the forms to him
                    at that meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Telemedia’s pleaded position is
                    consistent with a letter dated 26 April 2012 sent from Telemedia’s
                    solicitors to Crédit Agricole’s solicitors. The letter stated that the
                    “... [account-opening forms] which were handed to [Mr Hartanto] on
                    30 November 2010 were signed and returned to [Mr Goh] on the very day
                    itself”. Telemedia’s pleaded position is also in line with the
                    position taken in Mr Hartanto’s AEIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     This initial position, however, was an
                    impossible one to take. The account-opening forms for the Asia Energy Account
                    bore the signatures of not just Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh. The forms also
                    bore the signature of Mr Hartanto’s nominee, Mr Supriadi.
                    Nowhere was it alleged that Mr Supriadi, who was based in Indonesia at that
                    time, was present at the meeting at Crédit Agricole’s premises in
                    Singapore on 30 November 2010. Mr Supriadi’s signature on the
                    Asia Energy account-opening form meant either that (a) Mr Supriadi was
                    present at the meeting on 30 November 2010; or (b) Mr Hartanto had to
                    bring the account-opening forms back in order to obtain Mr Supriadi’s
                    signature. Neither of these possibilities is consistent with Telemedia’s
                    initial position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     When Mr Hartanto gave evidence in
                    cross-examination on the first day of the trial, he departed from the initial
                    position stated in Telemedia’s pleadings and his AEIC. This was the first
                    time Mr Hartanto gave his version of events that there were three meetings at
                    Crédit Agricole’s premises instead of two. His oral evidence was that
                    Mr Goh gave him the account-opening forms at a meeting on 14 November
                    2010 <em>before</em> the completed forms were returned at
                    the meeting on 30 November 2010. This meeting of 14 November 2010 had
                    gone hitherto unmentioned by Telemedia and Mr Hartanto their pleadings and
                    AEIC respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     On the first day of trial, Mr Hartanto
                    went on to state that he did not sign any of the account-opening forms which
                    were given to him at the meeting on 14 November 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> He merely collected the forms and
                    brought them back to Hong Kong to prepare the supporting documents needed for
                    opening the accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This included obtaining
                    Mr Supriadi’s signature on the documents Mr Supriadi was
                    required to sign on.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> After all the documents had
                    been prepared, Mr Hartanto met up with Mr Yeh and Mr Goh at
                    Crédit Agricole’s premises a third time on 25 or 26 November 2010 (as
                    opposed to the initial position that this meeting occurred on 30 November
                    2010). At this final meeting, Mr Yeh and Mr Hartanto signed <em>all</em> the account-opening forms in the presence of
                    Mr Goh. The forms were then returned to Mr Goh immediately after they
                    were signed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     On the second day of the trial,
                    Mr Hartanto’s evidence (given the previous day) that he signed
                        <em>all</em> the account-opening forms on 25 or
                    26 November 2010 was subject to intense forensic cross-examination. An
                    examination of Mr Hartanto’s signatures on the two sets of
                    account-opening forms reveal that he had used <em>three different
                        pens</em> to sign both sets of forms. Mr Hartanto accepted as
                    much under cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Most of the Telemedia
                    account-opening forms were signed with a black pen. A blue pen was used to sign
                    the “General Conditions for the Grant of Collateralised Credits”
                    form for the Telemedia Account. Another blue pen was used to sign the
                    “Application to Establish Relations” form and the “Security
                    Agreement” form for the Asia Energy Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Counsel for Crédit Agricole, Mr Gary Low,
                    put to Mr Hartanto that all the account-opening forms could not have been
                    signed at the same meeting on the same day. If that were the case, there would
                    be no reason for Mr Hartanto to have used three different pens.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Even more so since Mr Hartanto
                    had admitted that he signed the documents without looking through them. To his
                    mind, they were standard form documents, and the spaces where he was required to
                    sign on were already previously marked out with crosses/stickers by
                        Ms Teo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Mr Hartanto was unable to provide a
                    convincing explanation for his use of three different pens. He evaded
                    Mr Low’s questions and made the excuse that the original documents
                    had only been placed before him on that day of trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> When pressed by Mr Low,
                    Mr Hartanto stated that he could not recall how many pens he used or how
                    many times he had met Mr Goh to sign the account-opening forms. When he was
                    asked if there was more than one meeting at which he signed the account-opening
                    forms, Mr Hartanto said that he could only remember one meeting at the end
                    of November.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Mr Hartanto’s evolving evidence
                    compromised both the reliability and integrity of Telemedia’s position.
                    The departures from Telemedia’s pleadings and his AEIC are significant
                    ones. Central to this dispute is the movement of the account-opening forms and
                    when they were signed. Yet, Mr Hartanto’s evidence on these very
                    events wavered and shifted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In his evidence on the first day of trial,
                    he introduced a meeting on 14 November 2010, which went previously
                    unmentioned. He claimed that he brought the account-opening forms to Hong Kong
                    SAR after collecting them at Crédit Agricole’s premises on
                    14 November 2010, whereas it was previously maintained that the receipt,
                    signing and return of the account-opening forms happened within the span of one
                    meeting on 30 November 2010. He was also unable to explain why he used
                    three different pens to sign the account-opening forms in the light of his own
                    evidence that they were signed on the same occasion and without
                perusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In contrast, the evidence of Mr Yeh and
                    Mr Goh on the number of meetings, the movement of the forms, and where they
                    were signed was reliable and unshaken in cross-examination. Both their versions
                    of events were coherent and largely compatible with the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Telemedia’s position is inconsistent with the documentary
                evidence leading up to the opening of the Telemedia Account and Asia Energy
                Account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The period leading up to the opening of the
                    Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account—October 2010 to 2 December
                    2010—was characterised by a near complete absence of contemporaneous
                    documentation. The only documentary evidence placed before the court was:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_a"></a>(a)     the NRLs and SCA dated 14 and
                        15 November 2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_b"></a>(b)     two emails from Ms Teo to Mr Yeh, both dated
                        16 November 2010, requesting for documents required for Asia Energy and
                        other BVI companies;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_c"></a>(c)     an email from Ms Teo to Patty Chan
                        (“Ms Chan”), Mr Hartanto’s personal assistant,
                        dated 16 November 2010, enclosing blank Security Agreement forms (one of the
                        forms that were required for opening an account at Crédit Agricole),
                        requesting that Mr Hartanto sign and affix the Telemedia corporate seal
                        to the blank Security Agreement form, and to courier the completed form to
                        Crédit Agricole;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_d"></a>(d)     an email from Ms Teo to Ms Chan dated
                        26 November 2010 requesting that Ms Chan obtain relevant
                        signatures for certain declarations of trust;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_102-p2_e"></a>(e)     the two sets of completed and signed
                        account-opening forms dated 30 November 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Of particular interest are the emails from Ms Teo to
                        Mr Yeh and Ms Chan dated 16 November 2010 at (b) and (c). In
                        my view, the emails sent that day undermine Mr Hartanto’s
                        evidence and support the evidence of Mr Yeh and
                    Mr Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It will be recalled that Mr Yeh’s
                    evidence is that on 15 November 2010, he couriered the completed
                    account-opening forms from Shenzhen to Mr Goh in Singapore.
                    Mr Goh’s evidence was that he received the completed account-opening
                    forms by courier on 16 November 2010. After he received the forms,
                    Mr Goh asked Ms Teo to review the completed forms and ensure that
                    everything was in order. The emails Ms Teo sent to Mr Yeh and
                    Ms Chan on 16 November 2010 are consistent with this sequence of
                    events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Further, these emails undermine
                    Mr Hartanto’s version of events in two ways. First, they cast doubt
                    on Mr Hartanto’s position that Mr Yeh was not involved in the
                    collation and preparation of the supporting documents for the opening of both
                    accounts (see [89] above). It would be out of the ordinary for Ms Teo to
                    send an email to Mr Yeh requesting for supporting documents for no apparent
                    reason if he did not assist with the collation of the supporting documents or
                    the account-opening process. The email suggests that Mr Yeh played a more
                    active role than Mr Hartanto was letting on. Indeed, it bears repeating
                    that Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh were engaged in a process to set up their
                    joint-venture investment plan that was embodied in the NRLs and
                SCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Second, Ms Teo’s email to
                    Ms Chan suggests that the completed account-opening forms had been returned
                    to Crédit Agricole by 16 November 2010. It suggests that Mr Hartanto
                    had missed out the Security Agreement form, and that his signature was required.
                    If Mr Hartanto’s version is true, and the account-opening forms were
                    only returned to Crédit Agricole on 25 or 26 November 2010, it is
                    inexplicable that Ms Teo would arbitrarily select one out of a number of
                    account-opening forms to send to Ms Chan for Mr Hartanto to sign and
                    affix Telemedia’s corporate seal on 16 November 2010, before the
                    entire set of completed and signed documents were returned to Crédit
                    Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Telemedia’s position is inconsistent with
                Mr Hartanto’s reaction when he discovered that Mr Yeh was singly
                authorised to transfer shares out of the Telemedia Account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Mr Hartanto’s reaction when he
                    purportedly discovered that Mr Yeh was singly authorised to transfer shares
                    out of the Telemedia Account is inconsistent with his version of events. I say
                    this based on his response to two critical emails: (a) Mr Yeh’s email
                    of 8 September 2011 to Mr Hartanto (copying Mr Goh) instructing
                    that the 225m NexGen shares be transferred out of the Telemedia Account and into
                    the Yuanta Account; and (b) Ms Teo’s email on 12 September 2011
                    informing Mr Hartanto that Mr Yeh had given instructions to transfer
                    the 225m NexGen shares, and reminding Mr Hartanto to make an SGX
                    announcement on the transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Mr Hartanto’s response to Mr Yeh’s
                email dated 8 September 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    A valuation event occurred in 2011 and
                    top-up notices were apparently issued by Yuanta to Telemedia after this had
                    occurred. On 8 September 2011, Mr Yeh sent an email to
                    Mr Hartanto copying Mr Goh. The email was written in Mandarin, but
                    translated for the purposes of the trial. I reproduce the translation in full
                    for convenience:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regard to our three Email[s] dated 10 August, 25 August and 2

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I should also mention that despite its importance, this email
                        was not disclosed by Telemedia in discovery, nor was any mention of it made
                        in Mr Hartanto’s AEIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Mr Hartanto did not respond to this
                    email nor did he dispute Mr Yeh’s authority to instruct Mr Goh
                    to transfer the 225m NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In cross-examination, Mr Hartanto
                    claimed that he was unaware of what was stated in this email, for reasons that I
                    shall come to in a moment. Instead, Mr Hartanto claimed that he was only
                    aware that Mr Yeh had instructed Crédit Agricole to transfer the
                    shares on 12 September 2011, when Ms Teo sent him the SGX announcement
                    reminder (see [38] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    If Mr Hartanto had read the
                    8 September 2011 email, his failure to respond to dispute
                    Mr Yeh’s authority to give instructions for the transfer of the
                    NexGen shares would be telling. If Mr Yeh was not authorised to instruct
                    the transfer, one would have expected a robust response from Mr Hartanto
                    denying Mr Yeh’s authority to do so. Instead, nothing was heard from
                    Mr Hartanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Mr Hartanto’s excuse in
                    cross-examination for failing to respond to the email was that it was written in
                    Mandarin and not English. Mr Hartanto added that he could not read Mandarin
                    proficiently and that he could not fully understand the language.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> In cross-examination,
                    Mr Hartanto testified that his proficiency in reading and understanding
                    Mandarin was about fifty percent. That said, it bears repeating that Mr Yeh
                    does not speak English and that while Mr Hartanto is not a hundred percent
                    proficient in Mandarin, he very likely possesses sufficient understanding of
                    spoken Mandarin to conduct business discussions with Mr Yeh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Counsel for Crédit Agricole, Mr Low,
                    suggested to Mr Hartanto that <em>all previous
                        communications</em> between Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh had been
                    in Mandarin. Further, the NRLs and SCA, which Mr Hartanto signed, were both
                    in Mandarin as well. Mr Hartanto therefore must have had a sufficient
                    degree of proficiency in reading Mandarin.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Hartanto’s response was that in those cases, he would have his
                    assistant translate the documents translated. When asked why he did not ask his
                    assistant to translate the 8 September 2011 email, Mr Hartanto
                    responded that he was “not in office that day”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    When Mr Hartanto was pressed on the
                    excuse of his language deficiency, he provided a different explanation for his
                    failure to respond to the email. He stated that he understood
                    Mr Yeh’s 8 September 2011 email to mean that Mr Yeh was
                    merely making a request for the shares to be transferred as he did not have the
                    power to give such an instruction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Mr Low then suggested to
                    Mr Hartanto that the last line of the 8 September 2011 email was a
                        <em>direction</em> to Mr Goh to effect the
                    transfer. Mr Yeh was clearly not waiting for Mr Hartanto to effect the
                    transfer, as Mr Hartanto appeared to be suggesting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> To this, Mr Hartanto’s
                    response was: “[s]orry ... I don’t read this email on the 8th
                    September ... 8th September is in Chinese and I don’t read this
                        ...”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Hartanto’s position had shifted yet again. He claimed that he had
                    not read the email at all because it was in Mandarin. Mr Hartanto accepted
                    after he had read the English translation of the email in court that Mr Yeh
                    was giving instructions for the shares to be transferred
                        immediately.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Mr Hartanto subsequently went on to
                    accept that he was aware that Mr Yeh had given instructions for the
                    transfer of the 225m NexGen shares as early as 8 September
                        2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> When asked why he did not then reply
                    to Mr Yeh’s email dated 8 September 2011 to deny
                    Mr Yeh’s authority to instruct the transfer of the shares, Mr
                    Hartanto responded that he did not think that it was necessary for him to reply.
                    To his mind, Mr Yeh did not have the authority to instruct the transfer and
                    there was therefore no need to respond to assert that.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    From only understanding the email partially,
                    to misinterpreting the email, to not reading the email at all, to understanding
                    the effect of the email but not believing that it was necessary to deny
                    Mr Yeh’s authority, I find Mr Hartanto’s evidence on why
                    he did not respond to the 8 September 2011 email unpersuasive. I am of the
                    view that Mr Hartanto read and understood the email, or at least had the
                    email explained to him by his assistant. He thereafter chose not to respond and
                    deny Mr Yeh’s authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In assessing the evidence on this point, I
                    note that the main body of the email appears to request, albeit in strong terms,
                    that Mr Hartanto “please transfer on a temporary basis the 225
                    million shares” to Yuanta. The final section of the email which is
                    addressed to Mr Goh, however, directs Mr Goh to transfer the shares
                        <em>immediately</em> and notify Mr Hartanto once
                    it is done. In my view, the reasonable interpretation is that there was a clear
                    instruction from Mr Yeh to Mr Goh to effect the transfer of the
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Mr Hartanto’s response to Ms Teo’s
                reminder email dated 12 September 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    I next turn to Mr Hartanto’s
                    response to Ms Teo’s reminder email sent on 12 September 2011.
                    This email is crucial because it was the first time Crédit Agricole made it
                    unequivocally clear to Mr Hartanto that it was about to transfer the 225m
                    NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account on Mr Yeh’s sole
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    This time, Mr Hartanto did respond. He
                    replied to Ms Teo’s email notification, denying Mr Yeh’s
                    authority. But he only went so far, and no further. Mr Hartanto made no
                    further attempt to investigate how Mr Yeh came to be singly authorised to
                    operate the Telemedia Account. He did not try to find out how Crédit Agricole
                    came to be of the view that Mr Yeh was singly authorised to operate the
                    Telemedia Account. He did not instruct Crédit Agricole not to effect any
                    transfers on the instructions of Mr Yeh because he was not a singly
                    authorised signatory. He took no steps to remove Mr Yeh as a signatory to
                    the Telemedia Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I will review the correspondence between
                    Mr Hartanto and Ms Teo on 12 September 2011 and 13 September 2011
                    in detail, before turning to Mr Hartanto’s and Ms Teo’s
                    evidence on the purported telephone calls that took place on 12 September
                    2011. I will then proceed to elaborate on why Mr Hartanto’s response
                    was inconsistent with Telemedia’s position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    On 12 September 2011, and on the back
                    of Mr Yeh’s request and email dated 8 September 2011 (just
                    discussed above), Mr Goh asked Ms Teo to contact Mr Hartanto and
                    inform him of the transfer instructions that had been received from Mr Yeh.
                    Mr Goh stated that even though Mr Yeh was singly authorised to operate
                    the Telemedia Account, he wanted to inform Mr Hartanto of the transfer as a
                    matter of client relationship management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Ms Teo attempted to telephone
                    Mr Hartanto but was unsuccessful. She then sent an email to
                    Mr Hartanto at 3.41pm informing him that Crédit Agricole will be making the
                    transfer pursuant to Mr Yeh’s instructions. The email also reminded
                    Mr Hartanto to make the necessary SGX announcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Mr Hartanto responded at 3.52pm stating
                    tersely that “[Telemedia’s] signature is not [Mr Yeh]
                        [<em>sic</em>]. Please
                understand.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Ms Teo responded by email at 6.11pm
                    stating that Mr Yeh had been singly authorised to operate the Telemedia
                    Account since its opening, and that Crédit Agricole was required to accept
                    Mr Yeh’s instructions. Ms Teo requested that Mr Hartanto
                    liaise with Mr Yeh on the transfer of the NexGen shares. She copied both
                    Mr Yeh and Mr Goh in this email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Mr Hartanto responded with four
                    emails:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_a"></a>(a)     At 6.18pm, he wrote: “I
                        think you are wrong as [Mr Yeh] is not the director of [Telemedia] and
                        I think it is wrong [that] he is the signer [<em>sic</em>] of [Telemedia]???”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_b"></a>(b)     At 6.21pm, he sent another email stating:
                        “[Ms Teo], I ask to [<em>sic</em>] [Mr Goh]
                        about the deal with [Mr Yeh] for the lease agreement for the 825
                        millions [<em>sic</em>] shares of [NexGen] from
                        [Telemedia] to [Asia Energy] through [Yuanta]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_c"></a>(c)     At 6.53pm, his third email stated
                        that he “had just talked to [Mr Yeh]” and that
                        “Telemedia will transfer 225 million shares to [Asia
                        Energy]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_125-p2_d"></a>(d)     At 6.54pm, Mr Hartanto asked for confirmation that the signature
                        requirement for the Asia Energy Account was the joint signatures of
                        Mr Yeh and Mr Supriadi and not “single
                        signatory”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Ms Teo did not
                        respond to any of these emails on 12 September 2011. Her email response
                        came only the next day, on 13 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Mr Hartanto also claimed in his AEIC
                    that he had made a telephone call to Ms Teo before he sent the 6.53pm email
                    on 12 September 2011. Whether this telephone call occurred, and if so, what
                    was said in the conversation is important. I will return to it in a
                    moment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In Ms Teo’s reply to the slew of
                    emails from Mr Hartanto on 13 September 2011, she stated that the Asia
                    Energy Account required the joint signatures of Mr Hartanto <em>and</em> Mr Yeh. While Mr Supriadi was a director
                    of Asia Energy, he was not operating the account. It appears that
                    Mr Hartanto had either forgotten, or was unsure, as to who were the
                    authorised signatories of the Asia Energy Account, which was the joint-venture
                    account. Ms Teo subsequently emailed Mr Hartanto a draft written
                    instruction to effect the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares from the Telemedia
                    Account to the Asia Energy Account for Mr Hartanto to sign and
                    return.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Mr Hartanto did not, however, sign and
                    return the form. The transfer of the 225m NexGen shares was therefore not
                    effected in September 2011. It was only subsequently in October 2011 that the
                    shares were actually transferred out of the Telemedia Account on
                    Mr Yeh’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Having laid out the email communication
                    between Mr Hartanto and Ms Teo, I return to Mr Hartanto’s
                    evidence on the purported telephone call to Ms Teo on 12 September
                    2011. Mr Hartanto claimed that he had called Ms Teo before he sent her
                    the 6.53pm email.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> This would presumably have been after
                    he sent the 6.21pm email to Ms Teo on the same day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In that telephone conversation, he
                    purportedly told Ms Teo repeatedly that no transfer of the NexGen shares
                    should be effected until he gave further instructions. He reiterated that
                    Mr Yeh was not a singly authorised signatory of the Telemedia Account.
                    Ms Teo purportedly promised him that no transfer would be made until Crédit
                    Agricole received further instructions from Mr Hartanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In cross-examination, however, when
                    Mr Hartanto was asked by Crédit Agricole’s counsel, Mr Low,
                    whether there had been any other communication between himself and Ms Teo
                    or Mr Yeh apart from the emails and telephone conversation with Mr Yeh
                    (referred to in the 6.53pm email at [125(c)] above), Mr Hartanto said he
                    could not remember. When asked by the court whether there was just one telephone
                    conversation (<em>ie</em>, the telephone conversation with
                    Mr Yeh), Mr Hartanto said there was “[o]nly one
                        ...”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Mr Hartanto was then asked numerous
                    times by Mr Low whether there were any other communications apart from the
                    emails and the telephone call to Mr Yeh. Mr Hartanto stated that he
                    could not remember. It was only when Mr Low referred Mr Hartanto to
                    his AEIC that Mr Hartanto recalled the telephone call that he purportedly
                    made to Ms Teo before he sent the 6.53pm email.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> He admitted that “just now I
                        forgotten”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In my view, this slip in
                    Mr Hartanto’s oral evidence is a significant one. It shows that
                    Mr Hartanto <em>did not</em> have a telephone
                    conversation with Ms Teo. I am aware of the recent observations of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd v
                        Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd</em> [2014] 3 SLR 562 at [56] that the
                    mere fact that there are gaps in the witness’s memory does not compel the
                    conclusion that the evidence is less credible. Especially so in cases where a
                    long period of time has elapsed between the events as they occurred and the
                    witness’s oral testimony in court. I am aware that Mr Hartanto may
                    have been frazzled or unsettled in the heat of cross-examination. But the point
                    still remains that the telephone call to Ms Teo was crucial. It was
                    Mr Hartanto’s <em>only instruction to Crédit Agricole
                        not to transfer shares on the instructions of Mr Yeh</em>. I do
                    not accept that Mr Hartanto would have “forgotten” such a
                    telephone call if it had occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    My finding that Mr Hartanto did not
                    telephone Ms Teo that day is reinforced by two further points. First, there
                    is no mention of the telephone call in any of Mr Hartanto’s
                    subsequent emails to Ms Teo. It would be surprising if such an important
                    telephone call had been made but the contents of it were not set out or at least
                    alluded to in Mr Hartanto’s subsequent email to
                Ms Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Second, Ms Teo’s evidence was
                    that she left the Crédit Agricole office shortly after receiving
                    Mr Hartanto’s 6.18pm email.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> While it was implicit in
                    Ms Teo’s evidence in cross-examination that she did <em>not</em> speak to Mr Hartanto over the telephone on 12
                    or 13 September 2011, she was not cross-examined specifically on the point.
                    Counsel for Telemedia, Mr N Sreenivasan SC (“Mr
                    Sreenivasan”), did not put to Ms Teo that such a telephone call had
                    occurred, in contravention of the rule in <em>Browne v
                        Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67. The court therefore did not have a direct
                    explanation from Ms Teo about what had happened. Her evidence nonetheless
                    is consistent with the fact that there had been no telephone call from Mr
                    Hartanto to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    I accordingly find that Telemedia has not
                    proven that Mr Hartanto telephoned Ms Teo on 12 September 2011.
                    The extent of his communication with Crédit Agricole is contained in his email
                    responses to Ms Teo described above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    I have mentioned that the upshot of
                    Telemedia’s position is that Mr Yeh had fraudulently inserted his
                    name as a singly-authorised signatory for the Telemedia Account. This was done
                    without Mr Hartanto’s knowledge or consent. Being held in that
                    account was 225m NexGen shares apparently belonging to Telemedia. On
                    Telemedia’s version of events, an unauthorised third party, Mr Yeh,
                    who had obtained access to the Telemedia Account through fraudulent means, was
                    now purporting to transfer the NexGen shares out of the account against
                    Mr Hartanto’s wishes. Further, the bank, Crédit Agricole, appeared to
                    be taking the position that it was authorised to take instructions from the
                    fraudster. If this was true, I doubt Mr Hartanto’s response would
                    have been as tepid as it was. He did not instruct Crédit Agricole not to act on
                    the instructions of Mr Yeh. He did not attempt to remove Mr Yeh as a
                    signatory. He did not even attempt to find out why Crédit Agricole was of the
                    view that Mr Yeh was a singly authorised signatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    For the reasons stated above, I prefer the
                    evidence of Mr Yeh and Mr Goh over that of Mr Hartanto. I
                    accordingly accept Crédit Agricole’s version of the events leading up to
                    the opening of the Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account on 2 December
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other factual findings and observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Having decided the main factual contention
                    between the parties, there remain a few peripheral factual disputes and other
                    observations which I will address in brief. In my view, the points that follow
                    are consistent with and reinforce the findings I have made above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The number of meetings at Crédit Agricole’s
                premises</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    As I have accepted Crédit Agricole’s
                    position that only two meetings took place at Crédit Agricole’s premises,
                    I will touch on some other evidential points that reinforce this
                finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Mr Hartanto justified his position that
                    there were three meetings at Crédit Agricole’s premises by asserting that
                    the first meeting was a preliminary one where some discussions were afoot, but
                    nothing concrete was established. The account-opening forms were therefore not
                    handed to him at the first meeting in October 2011. He relied on two points to
                    show that the first meeting involved merely preliminary discussions. In my view,
                    both those points were weak ones.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    First, Mr Hartanto’s position was
                    that he and Mr Yeh had yet to agree on Asia Energy as the joint-venture
                    vehicle at the first Crédit Agricole meeting. Therefore, much time at the first
                    meeting was spent discussing (inconclusively) which entity would be used as the
                    joint-venture vehicle. This was used to contradict Mr Yeh’s and
                    Mr Goh’s evidence that Asia Energy had been decided as the
                    joint-venture vehicle prior to the first meeting, which would have allowed the
                    account-opening forms for both the Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account to
                    be handed over to Mr Hartanto. In support of his position, Mr Hartanto
                    claimed in cross-examination that Asia Energy had not even been incorporated in
                    early October 2010. He further stated that they had only decided on Asia Energy
                    as the joint-venture vehicle on 14 November 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Contrary to Mr Hartanto’s
                    assertion, however, Asia Energy was incorporated on 28 November 2006. This
                    was proved with a Certificate of Incumbency for Asia Energy that was introduced
                    into evidence the day after Mr Hartanto made his assertion. Mr Hartanto
                    then altered his position and explained that although the company had been
                    incorporated at the time of the first meeting, he had initially intended to use
                    a new joint-venture vehicle. It was only when his accountant reminded him on
                    16 November 2010 that he had an existing unused BVI company, Asia Energy,
                    that they decided to use Asia Energy rather than create a new one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The second point Mr Hartanto relied on
                    to establish the preliminary nature of the first meeting was the role that
                    Crédit Agricole was to play in the joint investment between himself and
                    Mr Yeh. I shall deal with this in the next sub-section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The role that Crédit Agricole played in the joint-investment
                arrangement between Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Mr Hartanto took the position that
                    Crédit Agricole was to be approached as a lender and also for advisory services.
                    Mr Hartanto therefore claimed that a good part of the first Crédit Agricole
                    meeting was spent discussing the details of this intended arrangement. This
                    included whether Crédit Agricole could provide large loan facilities on the
                    collateral of a single security. Mr Hartanto’s evidence was that both
                    Mr Yeh and himself eventually agreed to use Yuanta to borrow the funds from
                    Crédit Agricole because Yuanta was an existing customer of Crédit Agricole and
                    would have had better access to the contemplated credit
                facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    I do not accept Mr Hartanto’s
                    suggestion that Crédit Agricole was intended to be approached as a lender and
                    advisor for the joint-investment arrangement, and that much of the first meeting
                    was spent discussing the loan details. First, these purported discussions on
                    Crédit Agricole’s role as a lender were not pleaded. Second, and in my
                    view, the role Crédit Agricole had to play in the joint investment was a narrow
                    one. It was merely intended for Crédit Agricole to be a banking vehicle in which
                    the joint-investment accounts were set up, and through which the parties
                    transacted their own private business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Indeed, it is unlikely that Mr Hartanto
                    and Mr Yeh—both seasoned businessmen—would have engaged Crédit
                    Agricole or Mr Goh to provide advice on the relationship between
                    Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh or Telemedia and Yuanta. While it is undisputed
                    that Mr Goh provided some forms to Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh in
                    respect of precious metal trading and foreign exchange investments, it is clear
                    that no wealth management products were actually purchased from Crédit
                    Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Third, I do not accept
                    Mr Hartanto’s position that Crédit Agricole was intended to fund the
                    joint investment. There is no documentary evidence indicating that this was the
                    case. Further, the subsequent NRLs and SCA stipulated that Mr Yeh could
                    raise loans from <em>any</em> financial institution. If
                    Crédit Agricole was intended to be the lender of first resort, one would have
                    expected this to have been found in the documentation. There would have been
                    some supporting evidence of loans or credit facilities offered by Crédit
                    Agricole, but there were none.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    It is likely that Mr Hartanto and
                    Mr Yeh had already reached an agreement on the general structure of the
                    joint investment by the first Crédit Agricole meeting. They had many prior
                    meetings and discussions. They were seasoned businessmen who would have known
                    how to plan and structure their affairs. At the first Crédit Agricole meeting,
                    they already knew that they wanted to set up the Telemedia Account and Asia
                    Energy Account. They collected the account-opening forms at that
                meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The meetings in Shenzhen/Hong Kong SAR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    There was disagreement between
                    Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh on where the mid-November 2010 meetings took
                    place. Both Mr Hartanto’s and Mr Yeh’s evidence was that
                    there was a meeting between the two of them in Shenzhen on 14 November
                    2010. The dispute was as to where the subsequent meeting on 15 November
                    2010 occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Mr Yeh’s position was that on
                    14 November 2010, the NRLs and SCA were signed. Mr Hartanto and
                    Mr Yeh further agreed that the latter was to have signing rights over the
                    Telemedia Account. Mr Yeh stated in his oral evidence that there was a
                    second meeting in Shenzhen on 15 November 2010 where both of them signed
                    the account-opening forms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> This is a
                    significant point because the earliest supporting document for the
                    account-opening was the Telemedia “Memorandum and Articles of
                    Association” document dated 15 November 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Mr Yeh’s
                    evidence was that after the Telemedia account-opening forms were completed and
                    signed, he couriered them back to Crédit Agricole’s Singapore
                    branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Mr Hartanto’s evidence is that
                    while there was a meeting in Shenzhen on 14 November 2010, he did not go
                    back to Shenzhen on 15 November 2010. Mr Hartanto exhibited copies of
                    immigration records from Hong Kong SAR and Shenzhen authorities which show that
                    Mr Hartanto left Shenzhen in the very early hours of 15 November 2010
                    and that he did not re-enter Shenzhen again that day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> On
                    the basis of these immigration documents, Mr Sreenivasan, counsel for
                    Telemedia, asserted that Mr Yeh could not have signed the account-opening
                    forms on 15 November 2010 and therefore could not have sent the forms back
                    to Mr Goh on that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    I am inclined to believe
                    Mr Hartanto’s evidence on the mid-November 2010 meetings because it
                    is supported by contemporaneous documentation from the Hong Kong SAR and
                    Shenzhen authorities. But even accepting Mr Hartanto’s evidence, it
                    does not nearly go far enough to support Mr Sreenivasan’s assertion.
                    Mr Hartanto, in cross-examination, admitted that on 15 November 2010,
                    he had met Mr Yeh <em>in Hong Kong SAR</em>, rather
                    than Shenzhen, as Mr Yeh’s evidence suggests.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> In
                    other words, Mr Hartanto was not disputing that there was another meeting
                    on 15 November 2010. Mr Hartanto merely disputed the fact that the
                    meeting occurred in Shenzhen. Mr Hartanto’s evidence on this point is
                    therefore not inconsistent with the fact that he and Mr Yeh could have
                    completed and signed the Telemedia account-opening forms on 15 November
                    2010, albeit in Hong Kong SAR rather than Shenzhen. Mr Yeh could then have
                    sent the account-opening forms back to Mr Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    For the reasons I have given earlier, I am
                    of the view that Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh completed the account-opening
                    forms in mid-November 2010, and that Mr Yeh couriered them back to Crédit
                    Agricole in Singapore. Little turns on whether the signing actually took place
                    in Hong Kong SAR or Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The account-opening dates</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    It is undisputed that the Telemedia Account
                    and Asia Energy Account were opened on 2 December 2010. Crédit
                    Agricole’s position—that the account-opening forms were submitted on
                    16 November 2010—is consistent with these account-opening
                    dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Mr Hartanto’s evidence, on the
                    other hand, was that the completed account-opening forms were returned to Crédit
                    Agricole at its premises on or slightly before 30 November 2010.
                    Mr Hartanto’s evidence on the precise date was unclear—at times
                    he suggested that the completed account-opening forms were handed over on 25 or
                    26 November 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Mr Goh stated that the time between the
                    completion and return of account-opening forms and the actual opening of the
                    account is ordinarily about two weeks, even on an expedited basis. This is
                    because of the various due diligence checks that are required to be performed
                    prior to the opening of the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Telemedia’s position is inconsistent
                    with this evidence. Even assuming Mr Hartanto returned the completed forms
                    to Crédit Agricole on 25 November 2010, it would have given Crédit Agricole
                    only a week before the actual accounts were opened. Mr Goh’s evidence
                    on the time taken between the submission of the account-opening forms and the
                    actual opening of the account is consistent with Crédit Agricole’s version
                    of the events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    While it is noted that Mr Goh’s
                    evidence on this point was given in re-examination, there is no other evidence
                    before the court on the time required for the opening of an account at Crédit
                    Agricole after receipt of the forms and documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   The email of 15 November 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Telemedia relies on the email from
                    Mr Goh to Mr Hartanto dated 15 November 2011. As a matter of
                    convenience, I reproduce the portions of the email that Telemedia relies
                    on:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We received your account opening forms without proof of beneficial owner
                        and the account opening was delayed by 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whilst pending the beneficial owner proof from you, all forms were handed
                        over to Mr Jack Yeh, your business partner and introducer to the
                        bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When all relevant forms and proof of ownership was furnished to us, the
                        signatory of [Telemedia] included yourself and Mr Jack Yeh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The account was opened in accordance to the paperwork furnished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Telemedia’s position is that the email sets out an
                        admission that Mr Goh handed the completed account-opening forms to
                        Mr Yeh without Mr Hartanto’s knowledge and consent. I reject
                        this argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    First, the email is not inconsistent with
                    Crédit Agricole’s position. It will be recalled that Mr Yeh’s
                    and Mr Goh’s evidence was that there was a second meeting in early
                    November 2010 at Crédit Agricole’s premises. Mr Hartanto had kept the
                    forms in an envelope, and told Mr Goh that the documents were incomplete.
                    The envelope was handed to Mr Yeh to complete the collation of the
                    documents. As a result of this, the completed account-opening forms were only
                    returned to Crédit Agricole in mid-November 2010. When the completed forms were
                    received by Crédit Agricole, Mr Yeh was already listed as a singly
                    authorised signatory. That sequence of events is consistent with the thrust of
                    what is suggested by the email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Second, while I recognise that the 15
                    November 2011 email does appear strangely phrased, the context in which the 15
                    November 2011 email was sent is unclear. The email was sent by Mr Goh and
                    refers to an earlier conversation between Mr Hartanto and himself
                    (“as per our earlier conversation ...”). Mr Hartanto did not give
                    any evidence as to what transpired in the earlier conversation, or what
                    questions he put to Mr Goh, that the latter sought to address in the email.
                    Mr Goh gave evidence that he could not recall the circumstances in which
                    the email was sent. In cross-examination, Mr Goh stated that he may have
                    sent the email in a hurry and could have made a mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    I therefore reject Telemedia’s
                    submission that the email of 15 November 2011 is an admission that
                    Mr Goh had surreptitiously handed the account-opening forms to Mr Yeh
                    without Mr Hartanto’s knowledge or consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   The commercial context of the joint investment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    That Mr Yeh was singly authorised to
                    operate the Telemedia Account is also, in my view, consistent with the broader
                    commercial context in which the joint investment took place, as well as the
                    terms of the NRLs and the SCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh were
                    entering into a complex commercial arrangement. The Telemedia Account played the
                    role of first-stop housing for the NexGen shares that would eventually be used
                    to securitise loans sourced for and arranged by Mr Yeh through Yuanta. The
                    NexGen shares held in the Telemedia Account were owned by
                Telemedia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    There is no doubt that Mr Yeh would
                    have had a legitimate and substantial interest in the NexGen shares parked in
                    the Telemedia Account, and by extension, in the operation of the Telemedia
                    Account. Mr Yeh, through his vehicle, Yuanta, would be undertaking
                    liability for considerable loans for the purpose of the joint investment with
                    Telemedia. Yuanta was doing so on the security of NexGen shares, which Telemedia
                    was required to provide. There is evidence that at the time of the transaction,
                    NexGen—a publicly listed company—was on the SGX watch
                list.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The NRLs and SCA <em>required</em> Telemedia to set up an account at Crédit Agricole. The
                    NexGen shares were to be parked in the Telemedia Account and transferred to the
                    Yuanta Account against the disbursement of the loan monies from Yuanta. If
                    Mr Yeh was not intended to have any signing rights over the Telemedia
                    Account, why was there a need to set up the Telemedia Account at Crédit
                    Agricole? Mr Hartanto could have simply transferred the shares to the
                    Yuanta Account from accounts at other banks or financial institutions where the
                    NexGen shares were held. In making this comment, it is noted that this point was
                    not touched on in the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    The point has been made already that the
                    NRLs between Yuanta and Telemedia concerned the NexGen shares owned by Telemedia
                    which were to be used as security for a non-recourse loan from Yuanta. Important
                    provisions in the NRLs included, in brief, the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_a"></a>(a)     Yuanta had the right to sell, trade
                        or pledge the securities at its discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_b"></a>(b)     Yuanta had the right to hold or deposit the
                        securities with any local or overseas depository institution or liquidation
                        company, issuers of securities without certificates and custodians at any
                        local or overseas bank or custodian centres.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mr Yeh was authorised to act as consultant and
                        representative of the project under the NRLs until they were
                        terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_168-p2_d"></a>(d)     Yuanta was to arrange for Telemedia to open a separate personal account
                        with Crédit Agricole into which Telemedia was to deposit the NexGen shares
                        which were subsequently to be transferred into the Yuanta
                    Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    The SCA also stated that the loans were to
                    be obtained from institutions to be arranged by Mr Yeh and to be used for
                    investments approved by both parties. Further, under the SCA, it was agreed that
                    Mr Yeh would be appointed to the board of directors as an executive
                    director and that Mr Yeh’s trust would join the company as a
                    shareholder. While there is considerable dispute as to whether this was a
                    reference to the board of Telemedia or NexGen, there is no doubt that
                    Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh were entering into a close business
                    relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    I have found that it was always the
                    intention for Mr Yeh, as a signatory to the Telemedia Account, to be singly
                    authorised to operate it. This finding is, in my view, consistent with the terms
                    of the NRLs and SCA signed by Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh in mid-November
                    2010, and the broader context of the joint investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(7)   Telemedia’s failure to call Ms Chan and
                Mr Supriadi as witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Crédit Agricole, in its closing submissions,
                    raises a number of other evidential matters which it says are relevant to
                    assessing the credibility of Mr Hartanto’s evidence in support of
                    Telemedia’s case. These include the failure of Telemedia to call
                    Ms Chan and Mr Supriadi as witnesses. Ms Chan is
                    Mr Hartanto’s secretary in Hong Kong SAR. She assisted in the
                    collation of relevant supporting documents for the opening of the accounts. She
                    also liaised with Mr Yeh and Crédit Agricole on matters pertaining to the
                    opening of the Telemedia Account. Mr Supriadi signed the account-opening
                    forms for the Asia Energy Account as Mr Hartanto’s nominee. He was
                    apparently resident in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Crédit Agricole’s point is that both
                    the evidence of Ms Chan and Mr Supriadi may have been helpful in
                    determining the sequence of events leading up to the opening of the Telemedia
                    Account. It relies on s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)
                    (“the EA”). Section 116 provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to
                        have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events,
                        human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the
                        facts of the particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Illustration (g) to s 116 of the EA
                    states that the court may presume “that evidence which could be and is
                    not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds
                    it”. Crédit Agricole relies on the authority of <em>Cheong
                        Ghim Fah and another v Murugian s/o Ramasamy</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 628
                    and asks the court to draw an adverse inference against Telemedia for its
                    failure to call Ms Chan and Mr Supriadi as witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    I accept that these two individuals may have
                    been able to shed some light on the sequence of events leading up to the opening
                    of the Telemedia Account and Asia Energy Account. Ms Chan, in particular,
                    may have been able to provide information on whether there had been a second
                    meeting in Hong Kong SAR or Shenzhen on 15 November 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    I am nonetheless of the view that the
                    failure to call them as witnesses is a neutral factor. It is unlikely that
                    Mr Supriadi would have been able to testify as to what transpired on 14 and
                    15 November 2011, and whether the documents were sent back to Crédit
                    Agricole on 16 November 2011 by courier. Similarly, there is no evidence
                    which suggests that Ms Chan may have been present at the time when
                    Mr Yeh signed the Telemedia account-opening forms in the presence of
                    Mr Hartanto. In any case, I repeat my finding that based on the overall
                    assessment of the evidence, Mr Yeh signed the Telemedia account-opening
                    forms in the presence and with the consent of Mr Hartanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    I have addressed the factual issues relevant
                    to the case. I now turn to the legal arguments raised by the parties. The
                    following legal issues arise for determination in this case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_176-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether Crédit Agricole acted in
                        breach of its mandate from Telemedia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_176-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether Mr Yeh’s authority was revoked prior
                        to the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_176-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether Crédit Agricole was in breach of its
                        implied or common law duty of care owed to Telemedia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_176-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether Telemedia is contractually
                        estopped from claiming against Crédit Agricole; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_176-p2_e"></a>(e)     whether Telemedia is estopped by
                        representation from claiming against Crédit Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Crédit Agricole acted in breach of its mandate from
                Telemedia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The first claim brought by Telemedia is that
                    Crédit Agricole acted in breach of its mandate when it transferred the 225m
                    NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account on Mr Yeh’s instructions,
                    on the basis that Mr Yeh was never a singly authorised signatory with the
                    power to operate the Telemedia Account on his own.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    This claim falls away in the light of my
                    findings of fact set out above. I find that the Telemedia Account was properly
                    opened on 2 December 2010 and that Telemedia was bound by the contractual
                    documents setting out the scope of the banker-customer relationship, including
                    those relating to authorised signatories. As learned counsel for Crédit
                    Agricole, Mr Low, submits, it is trite law that in the absence of fraud or
                    misrepresentation, Telemedia is bound by the terms and effects of the signed
                    contractual documents: <em>Crédit Industriel et Commercial v Teo
                        Wai Cheong</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1149. Telemedia has not pleaded fraud or
                    misrepresentation on the part of Crédit Agricole, Mr Goh, or
                    Mr Yeh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Mr Yeh’s authority was revoked prior to the
                transfer of the NexGen shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Telemedia’s second and alternative
                    claim is that even if Mr Yeh was a singly authorised signatory, his
                    authority was revoked as a consequence of the correspondence between
                    Mr Hartanto and Ms Teo on 12 September 2011. The transfer of the
                    225m NexGen shares in October 2011 was consequently effected by Crédit Agricole
                    without authority. Telemedia argues that the substance of the correspondence had
                    the effect of an implied revocation of Mr Yeh’s authority to singly
                    operate the Telemedia Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Crédit Agricole raises a preliminary
                    objection on the ground that Telemedia’s pleadings are inconsistent.
                    Having taken the position that Mr Yeh was never a singly authorised
                    signatory right from the start, it is said to be inconsistent for Telemedia to
                    plead in the alternative that Mr Hartanto’s emails on
                        12<sup> </sup>September 2011 amounted to a revocation
                    of authority. This preliminary objection is groundless. Although the wording of
                    Telemedia’s pleadings appears somewhat inconsistent,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>
                    Telemedia is making the point that <em>even if</em>
                    Mr Yeh had been properly appointed as a singly authorised signatory, his
                    authority was, in any event, revoked on 12 September 2011. This is a
                    perfectly legitimate alternative position to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Telemedia’s submission raises two
                    subsidiary issues. First, whether the correspondence on 12 September 2011
                    can be construed as a revocation of Mr Yeh’s authority to operate the
                    Telemedia Account singly. If so, then whether such revocation was effective in
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the correspondence on 12 September 2011 can be construed
                as a revocation of Mr Yeh’s authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    The difficulty Telemedia faces with the
                    first hurdle is that in the correspondence on 12 September 2011,
                    Mr Hartanto’s position has always been to deny that Mr Yeh was
                    granted authority in the first place. In none of his emails to Ms Teo did
                    he intimate that <em>if</em> Mr Yeh was a singly
                    authorised signatory, then he wanted Crédit Agricole to revoke such
                    authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    For convenience, I will set out in brief the
                    email correspondence on 12 September 2011 which Telemedia relies on to
                    claim that there was an implied revocation of Mr Yeh’s
                    authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_183-p2_a"></a>(a)     3.41pm: Ms Teo emails
                        Mr Hartanto stating that Crédit Agricole will be transferring the
                        NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account in accordance with
                        Mr Yeh’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_183-p2_b"></a>(b)     3.52pm: Mr Hartanto responds, stating that
                        “[Telemedia’s] signature is not [Mr Yeh]. Please
                        understand”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_183-p2_c"></a>(c)     6.11pm: Ms Teo responds, stating that Mr Yeh has been an
                        authorised signatory since account opening and that Crédit Agricole is
                        entitled to accept Mr Yeh’s instructions. Ms Teo requests
                        that Mr Hartanto liaise with Mr Yeh on the transfer of NexGen
                        shares. She copies both Mr Yeh and Mr Goh in this
                    email.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_183-p2_d"></a>(d)     6.18pm:
                        Mr Hartanto replies, stating “I think you are wrong as
                        [Mr Yeh] is not the director of [Telemedia] and I think it is wrong
                        [that] he is the signer of [Telemedia]??”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_183-p2_e"></a>(e)     6.53pm: Mr Hartanto emails
                        Ms Teo stating that he “[j]ust talked to [Mr Yeh],
                        [Telemedia] will transfer to [Asia Energy] 225m
                    shares”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    An examination of the email exchange reveals
                    that Mr Hartanto never stated that any authority which Mr Yeh might
                    have been clothed with was revoked. I doubt that it was even implicit that his
                    authority was revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Mr Hartanto’s 3.52pm email
                    asserted that Mr Yeh was not a signatory. After Ms Teo’s 6.11pm
                    response, however, Mr Hartanto appears to have wavered in his position.
                    From a firm assertion that Mr Yeh did not have authority, he subsequently
                    used equivocal statements such as “I think you are wrong” and
                    “I think it is wrong, [that] he is the signer of [Telemedia]??”.
                    One might even say that Mr Hartanto was in fact acknowledging the
                    possibility that he was the one who had been mistaken and that Crédit
                    Agricole’s position was correct. Mr Hartanto himself accepted in
                    cross-examination that “none of [his] emails of [12 September 2011]
                    purport[ed] to revoke ... Mr Yeh’s authority”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In my view, the email correspondence
                    on its own cannot be construed as amounting to an implicit revocation of
                    Mr Yeh’s authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    On the other hand, I find the explanation
                    provided by Mr Goh and Ms Teo persuasive. Their evidence was that the
                    proper inference to be drawn from the emails is that Mr Hartanto had been
                    mistaken or had forgotten the details of the account mandate. It bears repeating
                    that Mr Hartanto had also forgotten or was confused as to who were the
                    authorised signatories to the Asia Energy Account. That was why he responded to
                    Ms Teo’s first email by denying Mr Yeh’s authority. But
                    when Ms Teo informed him that Mr Yeh was a singly authorised signatory
                    since the opening of the Telemedia Account, he realised that he may have been
                    mistaken, which explains his subsequent equivocal and uncertain responses.
                    Mr Hartanto had subsequently created the impression that his dispute with
                    Mr Yeh had been resolved by saying that he had “talked to
                    [Mr Yeh]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    If I had accepted Mr Hartanto’s
                    evidence of the phone call to Ms Teo and what was said in the telephone
                    conversation, I would have been prepared to accept that Mr Hartanto had, in
                    substance, purported to revoke Mr Yeh’s authority on
                    12 September 2011. I have, however, found that Telemedia has failed to
                    establish that such a telephone conversation did in fact occur. I am therefore
                    of the view that the correspondence on 12 September 2011 cannot be
                    construed as an implied revocation of Mr Yeh’s
                authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the purported revocation of Mr Yeh’s authority is,
                in any event, effective in law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    Even if the correspondence on
                    12 September 2011 can be construed as a revocation of Mr Yeh’s
                    authority, Telemedia faces the second hurdle of establishing that such
                    revocation was effective in law. The contractual documents are of particular
                    importance to this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    The Application to Establish Relations form
                    (described above at [27]) is the document that lists Mr Hartanto and
                    Mr Yeh as being singly authorised to operate the Telemedia Account. Clause
                    D of the form states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[s]ave where other written instruction has been specifically given to the
                        Bank, either below or by separate mail, the Bank may accept any instruction

                        risk of the Holder. This (these) method(s) of transmission shall likewise
                        apply to all other communications between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Telemedia submits that pursuant to clause D, any form of
                        written communication would be sufficient to constitute an instruction to
                        Crédit Agricole. In particular, there was no need for a new board resolution
                        to remove Mr Yeh as a singly authorised signatory. The revocation as
                        alleged to be set out in the emails from Mr Hartanto was sufficient to
                        constitute a valid revocation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Crédit Agricole, on the other hand, submits
                    that a revocation by email and/or telephone correspondence will not be
                    sufficient. Crédit Agricole points to clause 12 of the Certified Extract of
                    Board Resolution form (described at [28] above), which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… these resolutions be communicated to the Bank and shall
                        constitute the Company’s mandate to the Bank and remain in force and
                        effect <em>until an amending resolution shall have been
                            passed by the Directors, and a copy thereof certified by a Director or
                            the Company Secretary, shall have been actually received by the
                            Bank.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Crédit Agricole submits that nothing short of a Telemedia
                        board resolution revoking Mr Yeh’s authority will be
                        effective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    I am unable to accept Telemedia’s
                    submission based on clause D. The plain wording of clause D sets out a
                    general provision on the transmission of instructions and communications to
                    Crédit Agricole. The provision allows Crédit Agricole to accept communication
                    otherwise than by an “original document”. For example, the sending
                    of a photocopy of an original copy of a document falls within the ambit of
                    clause D. Clause D does not deal with the question as to who the
                    initial authorised signatories of the Telemedia Account are, or how changes can
                    be made to the list of initially authorised signatories.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Also relevant are Crédit Agricole’s
                    General Conditions, which have been incorporated as part of the contractual
                    documents (see [29] above). Clause 7.4 of the General Conditions is
                    similarly worded to clause D of the Application to Establish Relations
                    form. More details are provided in clause 7.4 which show the true purpose
                    of the provision. Clause 7.4 gives examples of communications which Crédit
                    Agricole may, in its discretion, accept. These include telephone instructions,
                    fax, electronic mail, <em>etc</em>. Crédit Agricole also
                    has the right to suspend compliance until more precise indications such as
                    written conformation is received if it considers the communication to be
                    incomplete, confusing or lacking authenticity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    In short, it is clear that clause 7.4
                    of the General Conditions, which is largely similar to clause D of the
                    Application to Establish Relations form, operates to the benefit of Crédit
                    Agricole. It is not a provision that enables Telemedia to revoke the authority
                    of an authorised signatory by email or telephone call when what is required is a
                    board resolution. Instead, it is a provision that entitles Crédit Agricole to
                    accept and rely on copies or non-original documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Next, I turn to the Certified Extract of
                    Board Resolution form. Clause 2 names Mr Hartanto and Mr Yeh as
                    the authorised persons with full authority to exercise all the powers of the
                    directors of the company and to execute and sign documents. Clause 2 also
                    states that they have the power to delegate their power and to appoint another
                    as an authorised person. Clause 12, quoted above (at [190]) states that the
                    Certified Extract of Board Resolution form constitutes Crédit Agricole’s
                    mandate from Telemedia. Clause 12 also states that the mandate will remain
                    in force and effect until an amending resolution is passed, with a copy that has
                    been certified by a director or the company secretary having been received by
                    Crédit Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    While it is clear that a board resolution is
                    not necessary for an authorised person to delegate his powers or to appoint an
                    additional signatory, it is clear that a board resolution is required to alter
                    or change the mandate that was conferred on Crédit Agricole. Clause 12
                    expressly states that the Certified Extract of Board Resolution constitutes the
                    mandate to Crédit Agricole. This <em>includes</em>
                    clause 12 which names Mr Yeh as one of the two authorised
                    persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    In cross-examination, Mr Hartanto
                    agreed that Crédit Agricole was bound to act in accordance with the mandate that
                    had been put in place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Mr Hartanto also agreed
                    that the Certified Copy of Board Resolution form which he signed constituted the
                    mandate to Crédit Agricole. He accepted that, prior to the transfer of the 225m
                    NexGen shares in October 2011, no amending resolution had been passed by
                    Telemedia to revoke Mr Yeh’s appointment as a singly authorised
                        signatory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Telemedia only passed a
                    resolution to revoke Mr Yeh’s authority in May 2013 (I am aware of
                    the fact that this was done on a without prejudice basis).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    For the reasons above, I find as a matter of
                    fact and law that Telemedia did not revoke Mr Yeh’s authority to
                    instruct Crédit Agricole to effect the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares out of
                    the Telemedia Account in October 2011. The contractual documents as a whole,
                    including the Certified Copy of Board Resolution form, require that an
                    alteration of Crédit Agricole’s mandate be done by a further board
                    resolution. That was not done prior to October 2011. I therefore reject
                    Telemedia’s submission on the revocation of Mr Yeh’s
                    mandate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Crédit Agricole was in breach of its implied or common law
                duty of care owed to Telemedia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    I now turn to Telemedia’s claim
                    against Crédit Agricole for the alleged breach of its duty of care owed to
                    Telemedia. Telemedia pleads that Crédit Agricole was in breach of five duties
                    that were implied into the banker-customer relationship:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_198-p2_a"></a>(a)     a duty to act in accordance with
                        Telemedia’s instructions and mandate and to act in accordance with any

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_198-p2_b"></a>(b)     a duty to take reasonable care and diligence to

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_198-p2_d"></a>(d)     a
                        duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence to ensure that Telemedia does
                        not suffer losses on account of failure to abide by Telemedia’s
                        instructions; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_198-p2_e"></a>(e)     a duty to ensure that Crédit Agricole and/or its employees do not act
                        negligently and/or recklessly towards Telemedia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Telemedia also pleads that these duties arose “as common
                        law duties of care owed by [Crédit Agricole] to
                            [Telemedia].”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    Telemedia’s position is that these
                    duties were breached by Crédit Agricole in three ways.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>
                    First, the forms and mandate executed by Mr Hartanto did not authorise
                    Crédit Agricole to act on the instructions of Mr Yeh. Second, Mr Goh
                    handed the completed account-opening forms to Mr Yeh without
                    Telemedia’s instructions, knowledge or authorisation. Third, Crédit
                    Agricole failed to act in accordance with the instructions of Mr Hartanto
                    when it was put on notice that Mr Yeh was not an authorised signatory; and
                    if Mr Yeh had in fact been previously authorised, that Crédit Agricole
                    failed to act in accordance with Telemedia’s revocation of such
                    authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Telemedia’s submissions on this point
                    appear to be predicated on the fact that Mr Yeh had no authority to operate
                    the Telemedia Account singly (whether from the outset, or whether because his
                    authority had been revoked on 12 September 2011).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    In view of my finding that Mr Yeh had
                    the authority to instruct the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares out of the
                    Telemedia Account in October 2011, Telemedia’s submissions on the breach
                    of Crédit Agricole’s duty of care accordingly fall away. In view of the
                    extensive submissions made by the parties, I will nonetheless go on to consider
                    the position on the assumption that Telemedia’s submission on this point
                    is made in the <em>alternative</em> (<em>ie</em>, that Crédit Agricole may be liable for a breach of duty of
                    care <em>even if</em> Mr Yeh was authorised to operate
                    the Telemedia Account).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Before turning to the claim based on a
                    common law duty of care, I note that counsel for Crédit Agricole has submitted
                    that the pleadings suggest that Telemedia’s case was that the terms could
                    be implied because of the banker-customer relationship which had
                        arisen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> In
                    short, the terms were said to have arisen as a matter of law for contracts of
                    this type and not because of business efficacy or the unexpressed intentions of
                    the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    To this end, I was referred to the legal
                    principle that terms are only to be implied as a matter of law with considerable
                    restraint (see the remarks of the Court of Appeal in <em>Chua
                        Choon Cheng and others v Allgreen Properties Ltd and another
                        appeal</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 at [69]). Such a term would apply to
                    all future like cases, rather than to the particular contract at hand, as is the
                    case for terms implied in fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    The scope of the pleaded implied terms has
                    not been set out clearly. The implied term that Crédit Agricole was under a duty
                    to take reasonable care and to exercise diligence to protect Telemedia’s
                    interest, wealth and assets is very broadly framed. In the absence of evidence
                    on the banker-customer relationship and detailed submissions on terms to be
                    implied as a matter of law, I make no further comment, save that I do not accept
                    that a sufficient basis has been made out to the imply the terms as a matter of
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    While Telemedia did not plead specifically
                    that the terms were to be implied as a matter of fact as arising out of the
                    particular circumstances at hand (although it did raise the point in
                    submissions), I note that Crédit Agricole does not, in any case, dispute that it
                    owes Telemedia the duties expected of a reasonable banker. The only question is
                    as to the scope of such a duty of care and whether Crédit Agricole’s
                    actions fell short of that duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    A convenient starting point is the general
                    principle that implied terms or duties must be viewed in light of the express
                    terms as set out in the contractual documents. Where the parties have entered
                    into an agreement, especially one which contains numerous detailed express
                    terms, the court must be careful not to imply a term which contradicts the
                    express terms. It is not the function of the court to rewrite the terms of the
                    bargain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    The observations of the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Deutsche Bank AG v Chang Tse Wen and another
                        appeal</em> [2013] 4 SLR 886 (“<em>Deutsche Bank
                        v Chang Tse Wen</em>”) are apposite. There, Sundaresh
                    Menon CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, stated at [51]
                    that as a matter of the evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it would have been highly unusual to find two quite separate
                        types of relationship between the same parties where one, an execution-only
                        contractual relationship, was meticulously recorded in written agreements
                        while the other, a general undertaking to provide investment and wealth
                        management advice, was not only not so recorded but was not even hinted at
                        anywhere in the evidence at all. Moreover, as a matter of law, it would be
                        equally unusual in such circumstances to find that wide obligations were
                        imposed or assumed by DB in tort well beyond those expressly or impliedly
                        undertaken with Dr Chang…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In making the above observation, Menon CJ referred to the
                        judgment of the Privy Council in <em>Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd
                            v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd and others</em> [1986] 1 AC 80
                            (“<em>Tai Hing Cotton
                        Mill</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    
          <em>Tai Hing Cotton
                        Mill</em> was a case on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong.
                    Lord Scarman delivered the judgment of the board. He stated at 107 that it was
                    correct in principle and necessary for the avoidance of confusion in the law to
                    adhere to the contractual analysis because it is the relationship in which the
                    parties have, subject to few exceptions, the right to determine their
                    obligations to each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    Much, of course, will depend on the scope of
                    the duty of care that is said to arise under common law. The thrust of the
                    holding in <em>Deutsche Bank v Chang Tse Wen</em> was that
                    great care was needed before finding that wide obligations were imposed or
                    assumed in tort, over and above those provided for in the contract. While the
                    circumstances will have to be very clear and cogent before any common law duty
                    of care will include a duty to advise or protect a client’s wealth and
                    assets, the same is not true with a duty to take care in carrying out
                    instructions. In principle, in appropriate cases, applying the test in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology
                        Agency</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100, a common law duty of care could arise
                    out of a banker-customer relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Crédit Agricole accepts that in the context
                    of the contractual documents and the particular facts, it owed a duty to honour
                    the contractual mandate subject only to circumstances that put it on
                        inquiry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> The court has, in
                    the past, recognised that an implied duty to take care in carrying out
                    instructions may arise. For example in <em>Bank of America
                        National Trust and Savings Association v Herman Iskandar and
                        another</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 848, the Court of Appeal found that the
                    bank in question was under an implied duty to inform account holders on the
                    maturity of their fixed deposits. Similarly, in <em>Go Dante Yap
                        v Bank of Austria Creditanstalt AG</em> [2011] 4 SLR 559, it was also
                    held that a bank is subject to an implied contractual and common law duty to
                    exercise skill and care in carrying out instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    The leading case on the duty to inquire is
                    the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Yogambikai Nagarajah v
                        Indian Overseas Bank and another appeal</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 774. In
                    that case, the Court of Appeal stated at [59] that when a bank was faced with
                    what appeared to be a genuine mandate presented by an agent acting within his
                    authority, the bank’s duty of care did not require it to do anything other
                    than to honour the mandate, in the absence of circumstances which put the bank
                    on inquiry. Where the bank was aware of such circumstances, it was not enough to
                    ignore them just because the bank was convinced that any inquiry would be futile
                    or that there was no risk to the customer. On this basis, the correct test was
                    whether the reasonably prudent banker faced with the same circumstances would
                    regard the course of action taken on the facts justifiable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    In the same vein, in <em>Hwang Cheng Tsu Hsu (by her litigation representative Hsu Ann Mei Amy) v
                        Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</em> [2010] 4 SLR 47, the court
                    was faced with the question as to whether the bank breached its duty to take
                    reasonable care in circumstances where the bank refused to follow the
                    customer’s instructions to close an account. Although Lai Siu Chiu J
                    dismissed the claim, she held at [74] that the bank’s contractual duty to
                    honour payment instructions in accordance with the customer’s mandate was
                    not absolute. There was no duty to follow the customer’s instructions
                    under any circumstances. The obligation to honour payment instructions was
                    qualified by the bank’s contractual duty to take reasonable care in
                    carrying out its operations with its customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    The question before the court was whether a
                    reasonable and prudent banker would have withheld payment because of a real or
                    serious possibility of an irregularity. Lai J, at [77] of the judgment,
                    gave the example that if there were reasonable grounds to believe that the
                    person attempting to make the withdrawal lacked authority to do so, then the
                    bank would be placed on inquiry. A mere suspicion, on the other hand, was not
                    enough.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    On appeal (which is reported as <em>Hsu Ann Mei Amy (personal representative of the estate of Hwang
                        Cheng Tsu Hsu, deceased) v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</em>
                    [2011] 2 SLR 178), the Court of Appeal agreed that it was trite law that a bank
                    was under a duty to comply with the customer’s mandate. The Court of
                    Appeal nonetheless recognised that the duty was subject to a duty to take
                    reasonable care in all the circumstances. The Court of Appeal stated (at [24])
                    that the question as to whether a prudent bank would be put on notice is a
                    fact-specific inquiry. Such a case might arise where the bank had reasonable
                    grounds (not necessarily amounting to proof) for believing that its client was
                    being defrauded or being subjected to improper pressure or influence. It would
                    be enough if a reasonable and honest banker would have considered that there was
                    a serious or real possibility that its customer might be being defrauded. The
                    Court of Appeal continued by observing (at [25]) that where the bank was dealing
                    with an elderly or infirm customer, it could be put on notice of improper
                    pressure or influence exerted over the customer by a third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    Thus framed, the question is whether Crédit
                    Agricole failed to act as a reasonable banker would have, even though it
                    appeared, and rightly so, that Mr Yeh was authorised to operate the
                    Telemedia Account singly. I am of the view that Crédit Agricole had not become
                    aware of any facts that would have put a reasonably prudent banker on inquiry,
                    such that they should have sought express confirmation from Mr Hartanto as
                    to whether Mr Yeh had authority to sign before transferring the 225m NexGen
                    shares on Mr Yeh’s instructions in October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    It was apparent on 12 September 2011
                    that a dispute had arisen between Mr Hartanto and Crédit Agricole as to the
                    signing conditions for the Telemedia Account. But in the circumstances, it was
                    reasonable for Mr Goh and Ms Teo to have concluded that
                    Mr Hartanto was mistaken and that he had subsequently clarified the
                    position with Mr Yeh. Perhaps Mr Goh and Ms Teo should have, out
                    of an abundance of caution, emailed Mr Hartanto in October 2011 to inform
                    him of Mr Yeh’s instructions, as they had done in September 2011.
                    Perhaps Ms Teo should have gone further than simply asking Mr Yeh to
                    remind Mr Hartanto to make the necessary SGX announcements. But I do not
                    think that in failing to do so, they did not act as a reasonably prudent banker
                    would. They were entitled to rely on Crédit Agricole’s mandate from
                    Telemedia, especially since it appeared that Mr Hartanto’s mistaken
                    impression of the signing rights over the account was resolved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    For these reasons, I hold that
                    Telemedia’s claim against Crédit Agricole for breach of its duty of care
                    fails. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the submissions of Crédit
                    Agricole on contributory negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Telemedia is contractually estopped from claiming against
                Crédit Agricole’s breaches</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    Crédit Agricole also relies on the doctrine
                    of contractual estoppel. Assuming Mr Yeh was not authorised to operate the
                    Telemedia Account, or that Crédit Agricole was in breach of its implied or
                    common law duty of care, Crédit Agricole argues that the claim is, in any event,
                    met by the conclusive evidence clause that forms part of the contract between
                    Crédit Agricole and Telemedia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    Crédit Agricole relies on clause 7.17 of its
                    General Conditions, which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Crédit Agricole’s position is that since Telemedia did
                        not complain about the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares out of the
                        Telemedia Account in accordance with the clause listed above, Telemedia is
                        contractually estopped from claiming against Crédit
                Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    Telemedia does not dispute the incorporation
                    of the conclusive evidence clause. It raises two submissions against Crédit
                    Agricole’s reliance on contractual estoppel. The first submission is that
                    the operation of a conclusive evidence clause is not a substitute for a
                    customer’s mandate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> Telemedia relies on the High Court decision of
                        <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank AG</em> [2011] 4 SLR 246
                        (“<em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em>”) and
                    argues that the conclusive evidence clause does not create authorisation where
                    none existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    Telemedia’s second submission is that
                    Crédit Agricole has not proven that it had dispatched the transaction advices it
                    is relying on to trigger the operation of the conclusive evidence
                        clause.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> In <em>Jiang Ou
                        v EFG Bank</em>, the court held (at [27]) that a bank seeking to rely
                    on a conclusive evidence clause must prove on a balance of probabilities that
                    the transaction advices were effectively dispatched to the customer. This
                    required proof on a balance of probabilities that the transaction documents
                    “were sent by ordinary mail to [the customer]”. Failure to prove
                    this fact would be fatal to the bank’s reliance on the conclusive evidence
                    clause. Telemedia argues that Crédit Agricole has failed to prove that the
                    transaction advices were effectively dispatched, as the evidence adduced by the
                    latter is hearsay and, in any event, unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    I will first review the law on conclusive
                    evidence clauses before addressing the two submissions raised by Telemedia. The
                    leading case is the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Pertamina
                        Energy Trading Limited v Credit Suisse</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 273
                        (“<em>Pertamina Energy v Credit
                    Suisse</em>”). There, a fraudulent employee caused his company
                    substantial losses in what was described as an audacious scam. The plaintiff
                    company had opened an account with the defendant bank. The account-opening
                    conditions authorised the bank to honour and comply with written instructions
                    from two named individuals. These individuals were given the right to operate
                    the bank account singly. The account-opening conditions contained a conclusive
                    evidence clause and a contractual right of set off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    Subsequently, a credit facility was
                    established with the bank secured by a charge over a deposit account which was
                    established in the company’s favour by X, one of the two authorised
                    signatories. X had also furnished the bank with a resolution, ostensibly
                    containing the signatures of the company’s directors, authorising a
                    drawdown under the credit facility. The bank required an amended signed
                    resolution and the company stamp to be affixed on the charge before the drawdown
                    could be effected. An officer of the bank, L, appended his signature as a
                    witness to the sealing of the charge despite not being present at the sealing.
                    The charge was then registered at the registry of companies in Hong Kong. The
                    bank subsequently allowed a drawdown of US$8m which was transferred by X to a
                    third party whose principal officer had introduced the company to the bank. The
                    bank statements were sent to X’s residential address in Singapore pursuant
                    to a mail-redirection letter signed by X. The bank, acting on the
                    company’s instructions conveyed through X, eventually set off the US$8m
                    against monies in the deposit account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    The Court of Appeal was faced with two main
                    issues. First, whether the documentation initiating the authorisation and
                    drawdown of the credit facility was not authorised or forged. Second, in the
                    event that the documents were not authorised or forged, then whether the bank
                    had a valid defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    V K Rajah J (as he then was), who
                    delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, characterised the situation (at
                    [1]) as an unfortunate one where an “eager bank officer [failed] to heed
                    the alarm bells in his zeal to facilitate and sustain a banking relationship
                    with that company”. On the facts, the charge document was found to be
                    improperly sealed. None of the company’s directors were present at the
                    sealing and no board resolution had been passed authorising the affixation of
                    the seal to the charge document. Given that the subsequent ratification
                    resolution was a forgery that was never signed by the company’s directors,
                    the documentation authorising the drawdown of the credit facility was not
                    properly authorised. That being so, the Court of Appeal noted (at [51]) that a
                    bank had no mandate to pay on a forged instrument of the customer. If it did, it
                    would be liable to the customer unless the customer was in breach of its duty to
                    the bank, including by failing to inform the bank of any forgery or unauthorised
                    drawing of a payment order or instruction as soon as the customer became aware
                    of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    Since that was the case, the key question
                    was whether the bank could avail itself of the conclusive evidence clause. The
                    Court of Appeal had no doubt that it was permissible for a bank to modify the
                    customer’s common law duty by express terms in the contract such as
                    conclusive evidence clauses. The Court of Appeal went on to explain (at [55])
                    that the essence of such a clause was to place the onus on the bank’s
                    customers to verify their bank statements and to notify the bank of any
                    discrepancy within a certain time period. If the customer failed to do so, then
                    the customer would be precluded from asserting that the statements did not
                    represent the true state of his accounts with the bank. The consequence would be
                    that the customer is unable to make a claim for the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    After reviewing previous case law from
                    Canada and Singapore, as well as academic criticism of those cases, the Court of
                    Appeal observed (at [63]) that conclusive evidence clauses were not peculiar to
                    banking contracts. They were also found in guarantees and construction
                    contracts. The Court of Appeal found that it was abundantly clear that
                    conclusive evidence clauses were neither uncommon nor alien in a “myriad
                    of commercial matrices”. It was rightly stressed that in the end, the
                    relationship between a bank and its customer was governed by contract and that
                    it was open to the parties to expressly agree on any peculiar arrangement to
                    define and determine their relationship, including the imposition of obligations
                    and responsibilities not usually recognised by common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    This was subject only to circumscription by
                    applicable legislation such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev
                    Ed) (“the UCTA”) and public policy considerations. One such
                    example would be if the bank was attempting to exclude liability for the fraud
                    of its own employees. The Court of Appeal opined that in such cases, it would
                    have no hesitation in declaring such a clause unreasonable and invalid. The
                    Court of Appeal also noted (at [65]) that a conclusive evidence clause would
                    only come into operation if the statements which the bank was relying on had
                    been effectively dispatched. The onus of proof of dispatch fell on the bank.
                    After consideration of the wording of the conclusive evidence clause and the
                    facts, the Court of Appeal held that the clause operated to exonerate the bank
                    from any liability in respect of acting on the forged documents in the
                    drawdown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    Returning to the facts of the case at hand,
                    there is no doubt that the conclusive evidence clause found in clause 7.17 of
                    the General Conditions forms part of the terms of the contract between Telemedia
                    and Crédit Agricole. Mr Hartanto had signed an express acknowledgment of
                    his receipt of the General Conditions, which stated that he had read and
                    approved the provisions. Mr Hartanto accepted in cross-examination that the
                    General Conditions formed part of the contractual documents binding Crédit
                    Agricole and Telemedia. He described the account-opening forms as setting out
                    standard terms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    It is also sufficiently clear that the
                    language of clause 7.17 of the General Conditions has the effect of a
                    conclusive evidence clause. The clause provides that, where a timely complaint
                    is not made, Telemedia agrees that the particulars in the communications will be
                        <em>deemed correct and approved</em>. Further, entries
                    on a statement or a portfolio valuation <em>may not be
                        contested</em> if they correspond to advices following the execution
                    of transactions which have not been contested in due course. <em>Any loss resulting from a late complaint shall be borne by the
                        client</em>. The words used make clear the importance of inspection
                    and timely response.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether reliance on a conclusive evidence clause is precluded in
                situations where the transaction in question is unauthorised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    I turn to Telemedia’s first submission
                    that the operation of the conclusive evidence clause is predicated on the
                    receipt of a valid instruction from the customer. The purpose of the conclusive
                    evidence clause is limited to imposing a requirement on the customer to ensure
                    that the instruction had been properly carried out. On this basis, if Telemedia
                    is correct in its primary submission that the transfer instructions from
                    Mr Yeh were invalid, the further submission is that Telemedia was not under
                    a duty to verify the information in the transaction advices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    This argument may be disposed of on the
                    basis of my factual findings above that Mr Yeh was in fact authorised to
                    instruct the transfer of the 225m NexGen shares. In any event, I am unable to
                    accept, as a matter of law, Telemedia’s submission that as long as the
                    transaction in question is an unauthorised one, the bank is not entitled to rely
                    on a conclusive evidence clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    In <em>Pertamina Energy v
                        Credit Suisse</em>, the conclusive evidence clause set out the
                    customer’s agreement that “unless the customer objects in writing
                    to any of the matters contained in such a statement within 14 days of the date
                    of such a statement, the customer shall be deemed conclusively to have accepted
                    all the matters contained in such statement as true and accurate in all
                    respects.” Even though the transfer instructions were forged—and
                    therefore, the transfer was made without authority—the Court of Appeal
                    found that the ambit of the conclusive evidence clause was wide enough to
                    exonerate the bank from the consequences of fraud perpetrated on the customer if
                    the customer failed to notify it of the relevant discrepancy within the
                    stipulated time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    In <em>Tjoa Elis v United
                        Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 747 (“<em>Tjoa Elis v UOB</em>”), the conclusive evidence clause stated
                    that the customer was under a duty to check all entries in the statement of
                    account. If the bank did not receive a written objection from the customer as to
                    the contents of any statement of account within 14 days of the statement
                    date:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_234-p2_a"></a>(a)     the customer shall be deemed
                        conclusively (i) to have accepted and shall be bound by the validity,

                        out in the statement; and (ii) to have ratified or confirmed each and every

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_234-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        statement shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the customer’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>After examining the clause, Woo
                        Bih Li JC (as he then was), held at [91] that the clause was wide and
                        clear enough to exclude the bank from liability, even if the signatures were
                        forgeries and the bank had allowed the unauthorised
                    withdrawals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    In <em>Jiang Ou v EFG
                        Bank</em>, Steven Chong J held that whether a particular risk of
                    loss due to error, discrepancy, forgery or an unauthorised transaction is
                    shifted onto the customer is a question of construction of the relevant clause.
                    Following the holding in <em>Tai Hing Cotton Mill</em>,
                    Chong J held at [93] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… if a bank seeks to contractually allocate the burden and
                        responsibility of the duty to inform of any forgery or unauthorised drawing
                        or instruction on the customer, no less than <em>clear and
                            unambiguous</em> reference will suffice. Sufficiently wide
                        language ascertainable by a reasonable person to include the specific
                        liability borne by the customer would also, in theory, suffice. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    To be clear, the effect of a conclusive
                    evidence clause is not, as Chong J rightly observed at [89], to create
                    authorisation where there was none. The effect of the clause is to place the
                    duty on the customer to verify the statements and advices. Even if the bank is
                    protected by the conclusive evidence clause, the fraudulent instruction remains
                    fraudulent and the customer will have to find his remedy
                elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    In <em>Jiang Ou v EFG
                        Bank</em>, clause 3.1 of the contract between the bank and the
                    customer stated that the bank shall send the customer periodic confirmations or
                    advices of all transactions carried out by the customer and/or its authorised
                    representative. The customer was under a duty to inform the bank promptly and,
                    in any event, within 14 days from the date of such confirmation or advice of any
                    discrepancies, omissions, incorrect or inaccurate entries, failing which the
                    bank may deem the client to have approved the original confirmations, advices or
                    statements of account in which case they shall be conclusive and binding upon
                    the customer. Clause 3.1 was made subject expressly to clause 3.2.
                    Clause 3.2 set out a conclusive evidence clause in respect of transaction
                    confirmations. The difference was that the customer was under a duty to notify
                    the bank within 14 days of any claimed discrepancy between the <em>instructions</em> and the transaction
                confirmation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    It was argued before the court that both
                    clauses 3.1 and 3.2 were limited to cases where the bank had acted on the
                    instructions from the customer. The clauses were irrelevant where the bank
                    carried out the transaction in the <em>absence</em> of
                    instructions. Chong J agreed, and held at [102] that the clauses did not
                    apply to protect transactions carried out without any instructions from the
                    customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    A close examination of the facts of
                        <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> reveals that it was a case
                    where the bank’s own employee, a client relationship officer, had executed
                    a series of high volume and high risk trades without any instructions from the
                    customer. <em>Jiang Ou v EFG Bank</em> was not a case where
                    the bank was led to believe that it had been given instructions from the client
                    or an authorised person. As Chong J pertinently observed at [103], in
                        <em>Pertamina Energy v Credit Suisse</em>, the court
                    was concerned with situations where, at the time the transactions were executed,
                        <em>the banks believed in good faith that they were acting in
                        accordance with the customer’s mandate or instructions</em>. The
                    mandate was subsequently found in some of the cases to have been vitiated by
                    forgery with the effect that the transactions were not authorised. None of those
                    cases concerned the forgery or fraud of the bank’s own employee or the
                    bank acting in the absence of any instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    On the facts of <em>Jiang Ou
                        v EFG Bank</em>, the holding of Chong J must be correct. The risk
                    of fraud by the bank’s own employee resides with the bank and nothing more
                    than express reference to fraud by an employee would be sufficient to bring such
                    a risk within the conclusive evidence clause. Even if there was express
                    reference to fraud by an employee, I agree with Chong J’s observation
                    at [108] that such a clause may well be contrary to public policy and may fall
                    afoul of the reasonableness test under UCTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    In the present dispute, however, there is no
                    evidence or suggestion that Mr Goh or Ms Teo had forged the transfer
                    instructions. Indeed, it is clear that Mr Goh and Ms Teo (and
                    therefore Crédit Agricole) thought that the October 2011 transfer instructions
                    signed by Mr Yeh were legitimate as Mr Yeh was a singly authorised
                    signatory. This is not a case where Crédit Agricole is attempting to protect
                    itself from the fraudulent behaviour of its own employee with the conclusive
                    evidence clause. I therefore dismiss Telemedia’s first argument on the
                    conclusive evidence clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Crédit Agricole has proven that the transaction advices were
                properly dispatched</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    Telemedia argues that there is insufficient
                    proof that the transaction advices were actually sent by Crédit Agricole to
                    Telemedia. They dispute the evidence given by Crédit Agricole’s witness,
                    Mr Michon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    Mr Michon is the department head of
                    Crédit Agricole’s S2i Mailing department. That department is responsible
                    for maintaining Crédit Agricole’s S2i system which processes, generates
                    and dispatches the statements of accounts and transaction advices to customers
                    of Crédit Agricole worldwide, including Singapore. Mr Michon gave evidence
                    that, to the best of his knowledge or understanding, the transaction advices for
                    the 10 and 14 October 2011 transfers of the 225m NexGen shares were
                    dispatched to Telemedia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    Telemedia’s attack on
                    Mr Michon’s evidence is two-pronged. First, Telemedia asserts that
                    his oral evidence is hearsay. Telemedia says that Mr Michon did not
                    directly perceive that the transaction advices were in fact dispatched to
                    Telemedia. At best, Mr Michon was stating his understanding of the
                    electronic records maintained by Crédit Agricole’s S2i system. Second,
                    Telemedia says that the basis of Mr Michon’s oral evidence—the
                    electronic records generated by the S2i system—is unreliable. Telemedia
                    submits that Crédit Agricole has therefore failed to prove that it effectively
                    dispatched the transaction advices. It is accordingly unable to rely on the
                    conclusive evidence clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    The objection along the lines that Telemedia
                    is taking is not an unfamiliar one. A similar objection was made in <em>Tjoa Elis v UOB</em>. There, the customer argued that there
                    was no direct evidence to prove that the statements in issue had been posted.
                    The bank in that case called the operations manager of Datapost Pte Ltd
                    (“Datapost”), a packing company, to explain how monthly statements
                    of account were packed by the bank and then picked up by Datapost. The evidence
                    included information on how Datapost would fold the statements, place them
                    inside envelopes and deliver the same to SingPost for posting. Woo JC
                    unsurprisingly remarked (at [34]) that it could not be seriously contended that
                    someone must be called to testify directly that he or she recalled placing the
                    particular statements in envelopes which were then delivered to SingPost.
                    Indeed, as in the present case, Woo JC noted that the customer had accepted
                    that she had received statements prior to those in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    The records reviewed by Mr Michon
                    comprised various printed electronic records retained by Crédit Agricole’s
                    S2i system. These documents had been disclosed in Crédit Agricole’s second
                    supplementary list of documents dated 30 December 2013. Telemedia did not
                    file a notice of non-admission. Neither did Telemedia object to the documents
                    being included in the agreed bundle or their being exhibited in
                    Mr Michon’s AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    Telemedia, in their closing submissions,
                    object to the reliability of the electronic records on the basis of
                    s 116A(1) of the EA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption is
                        adduced, where a device or process is one that, or is of a kind that, if
                        properly used, ordinarily produces or accurately communicates an electronic
                        record, the court shall presume that in producing or communicating that
                        electronic record on the occasion in question, the device or process
                        produced or accurately communicated the electronic record.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    The wording of section 116A is admittedly
                    rather clumsy. But there is no doubt that it sets out a presumption in favour of
                    the production or accurate communication of electronic records. If a process,
                    properly used, ordinarily produces or accurately communicates an electronic
                    record, then the court will presume that the electronic record in question was
                    produced or accurately communicated by that process. The presumption of the
                    production or accurate communication of the electronic record stands <em>unless</em> sufficient evidence is adduced to raise doubt as
                    to the production or accurate communication of the electronic
                record.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    Telemedia’s complaint is that Crédit
                    Agricole did not adduce evidence to prove that the devices and processes were
                    properly used in the first place. Mr Michon under cross-examination agreed
                    that he was not a computer programmer or computer engineer. He did not know the
                    technical aspects of the technology used in the system, both hardware and
                    software. His evidence was that of someone who was familiar with how to use the
                    system in practice. Rather much like a law librarian who knows how to use a
                    computer system to access and search legal databases, and to use the computer to
                    generate reports, without understanding the technical mechanics of the
                    underlying hardware and software.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    I am of the view that Telemedia’s
                    submission is flawed. The purpose of s 116A (introduced into the EA by
                    amendment in 2012) was to <em>facilitate</em> the use of
                    electronic records in evidence. Speaking in Parliament at the second reading of
                    the Evidence (Amendment) Bill, the Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam,
                    explained that the intention was to create a presumption in favour of the
                    admission of electronic records. Mr Shanmugam explained, touching on the
                    then-existing provisions on electronic records, (<em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates</em>, Official Report (14 February 2012) vol 88)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On computer output evidence ... [t]he current framework for the admission
                        of computer output evidence is found in sections 35 and 36. They were
                        introduced in 1996. Computer technology was then in its infancy. A cautious
                        approach was therefore taken. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[That was] a somewhat cumbersome process not consonant with modern
                        realities. With the benefit of experience, we can now say that computer
                        output evidence should not be treated differently from other evidence.
                        Sections 35 and 36 are therefore repealed. In addition, there will be
                        presumptions facilitating the admission of electronic records. For example,
                        where a device is one that, if properly used, accurately communicates an
                        electronic record, it will be presumed that an electronic record
                        communicated by that device was accurately communicated. Sounds a little
                        circular, but it does make sense. Further documents in the form of
                        electronic records will be treated as primary evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    The following illustration is also set out
                    in s 116A(1) of the EA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A seeks to adduce evidence in the form of an electronic record or document
                        produced by an electronic device or process. A proves that the electronic
                        device or process in question is one that, or is of a kind that, if properly
                        used, ordinarily produces that electronic record or document. This is a
                        relevant fact for the court to presume that in producing the electronic
                        record or document on the occasion in question, the electronic device or
                        process produced the electronic record or document which A seeks to
                        adduce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    Mr Michon explained that transaction
                    advices were automatically generated in the S2i system which captures and
                    records transactions executed in customers’ accounts. The S2i system
                    archives the documents, including transaction advices, in a “Print
                        Log”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> The S2i system also records the
                    number of envelopes necessary for the documents which are generated in a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    The documents which are automatically

                    Table”. The information in the Summary Table therefore corresponds with
                    documents recorded in the Print Log and Control Log of the previous business
                    day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    The enveloped documents are subsequently
                    collected and placed in rectangular Swiss Post boxes. The boxes are collected by
                    Swiss Post at 5pm every day. Swiss Post in turn produces a “Postage
                    Report” each month for Crédit Agricole to make payment
                        against.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    In my view, Mr Michon’s evidence
                    establishes first-hand that the S2i system <em>both</em>
                    ordinarily produces <em>and</em> accurately communicates
                    information of transactions by Crédit Agricole’s customers. The S2i system
                    also generates the transaction advices automatically, so there is no question of
                    proper operation. I do not think it is necessary for Mr Michon to have
                    knowledge and understanding of the technicalities of the S2i system in order for
                    his evidence to establish that the S2i system ordinarily produces/accurately
                    communicates information of transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    This is, in my view, sufficient to trigger
                    the presumption as to production and accurate communication in s 116A(1) of
                    the EA. The Print Logs and Control Logs for 10 and 14 October
                    2011—the two dates when the NexGen shares were transferred out of the
                    Telemedia Account—generated by the S2i mailing system were placed before
                    the court. Summary Tables and Postage Reports for 11 and 17 October 2011
                    (the next business days after 10 and 14 October 2011 respectively) were
                    also placed before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    The Print Logs and Control Logs establish
                    that transaction advices for the transfers of 112.5m NexGen shares were
                    generated at 10.46pm on 10 October 2011 and 10.25pm on 14 October
                    2011. The transaction advices were sorted into the 80th of 202 envelopes for the
                    former and the 112th of 238 envelopes for the latter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    The Summary Tables for 11 and
                    17 October 2011 indicated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_258-p2_a"></a>(a)     On 11 October 2011 there were
                        202 envelopes of type “VA03” (the types recorded in the Print
                        and Control Logs listed described above) and 2 envelopes of type
                        “VA11”, totalling 204 envelopes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_258-p2_b"></a>(b)     On 17 October 2011 there were 238
                        envelopes of type “VA03” and 1 envelope of type
                        “VA11”, totalling 239 envelopes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    The Postage Reports for the two days also
                    reflect 204 and 239 envelopes posted respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    In view of the evidence presented before the
                    court, coupled with the presumption in s 116A(1) of the EA, I am satisfied
                    that the transaction advices were in fact dispatched by Crédit Agricole.
                    Further, Mr Michon also gave evidence that if dispatched mail did not get
                    delivered, the undelivered envelopes would be returned to Crédit Agricole. To
                    the best of his knowledge and belief, this did not happen in respect of the
                    transaction advices sent to Telemedia on 11 and 17 October
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    Telemedia has not produced any evidence to
                    rebut the presumptions of production or accurate communication of the electronic
                    documents in s 116A(1) of the EA. Indeed, Telemedia merely asserts that it
                    did not receive the transaction advices of 11 and 17 October 2011.
                    Mr Hartanto’s evidence was that he did not receive those two
                    transaction advices. It should, however, be noted that Mr Hartanto agreed
                    in cross-examination that Telemedia had received all other transaction advices
                    and statements sent by Crédit Agricole, both before and after these two disputed
                    transaction advices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_262"></a>262    In my view, the evidence as a whole supports
                    Crédit Agricole’s position that the disputed transaction advices were sent
                    to Telemedia and were in all likelihood received by Telemedia. Telemedia did not
                    complain about the information stated in the transaction advices. As a
                    consequence of clause 7.17 of Crédit Agricole’s General Conditions,
                    Telemedia is contractually estopped from asserting that the transactions were
                    effected without authority. In view of my holding on contractual estoppel, it is
                    unnecessary for me to address Crédit Agricole’s submission on estoppel by
                    representation, and I will not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Crédit Agricole’s third-party claim against
                Mr Yeh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263"></a>263    The claim by Crédit Agricole against
                    Mr Yeh is predicated on Crédit Agricole being found liable to Telemedia.
                    Crédit Agricole’s claim is that Mr Yeh had misrepresented his
                    authority to sign on the Telemedia Account, and that Mr Yeh’s
                    misrepresentations were relied on to Crédit Agricole’s detriment. Crédit
                    Agricole and Mr Yeh presented a united front in their defence against
                    Telemedia’s claim. I have found that Telemedia’s claim fails. It
                    follows that it is not necessary to consider the alternative claim by Crédit
                    Agricole against Mr Yeh for deceit. But in view of the submissions and
                    evidence, I will set out a brief comment on the claim against Mr Yeh on the
                    basis that Telemedia has succeeded against Crédit Agricole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a>264    The claim appears to largely rest on the
                    tort of deceit: that Mr Yeh had deceived Crédit Agricole into thinking that
                    he was a singly authorised signatory with the power to singly operate the
                    Telemedia Account. If I had indeed found that Mr Yeh had somehow managed to
                    insert his name and signature into the account-opening forms without the
                    knowledge and consent of Mr Hartanto and Mr Goh or any other Crédit
                    Agricole bank officer, such as to cause Crédit Agricole to transfer the 225m
                    NexGen shares out of the Telemedia Account on the instructions of Mr Yeh,
                    the question as to whether Mr Yeh is liable in deceit to contribute to
                    and/or indemnify Crédit Agricole against Crédit Agricole’s liability might
                    have arisen. In such a case, questions as to the nature and scope of the
                    representations, reliance and causation may arise for
                consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a>265    Nonetheless in view of my primary findings
                    above, that Mr Yeh was a singly authorised signatory to the knowledge and
                    consent of Mr Hartanto, the third-party claim is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a>266    I would like, at this juncture, to make an
                    observation on the events leading up to the opening of the Telemedia Account,
                    which formed the substance of this dispute. On the version of the facts that I
                    have preferred, the account-opening forms were signed at different times, and
                    never in front of Mr Goh, Ms Teo, or another Crédit Agricole bank
                    officer. This, in my view, was unfortunate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_267"></a>267    In <em>Pertamina Energy v
                        Credit Suisse</em>, the bank officer had appended his signature as a
                    witness to the sealing of a charge despite being physically absent from the
                    sealing. Further, he indicated that he had seen original passports of the
                    company’s directors even though he had only seen faxed copies. The bank
                    officer in that case also failed to contact the company directors directly
                    despite concerns that the proper parties had not signed the documents. The Court
                    of Appeal in that case expressed the view at [86] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [L]amentably, the respondent appears to have been somewhat remiss in
                        the conduct of its relationship with the appellant. Due to the lack of
                        proper supervision, Lim took unwarranted liberties. It must be recognised
                        that a bank officer is more than a mere conduit and that he is accountable
                        for each and every responsibility he owes to the bank as well as its
                        customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_268"></a>268    Similarly, I am of the view that if either
                    Mr Goh or Ms Teo had witnessed the actual signing of the
                    account-opening forms, the room for dispute as to whether Mr Yeh was a
                    singly authorised signatory would have been reduced. The point I make is that,
                    as in the case of the bank officer in <em>Pertamina Energy v
                        Credit Suisse</em> (at [86]), Mr Goh was more “naïve than
                    knave”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_269"></a>269    I repeat, however, my earlier finding that
                    in any event, Mr Yeh was all along a singly authorised signatory to the
                    Telemedia Account with the knowledge and consent of
                Mr Hartanto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_270"></a>270    In summary:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_270-p2_a"></a>(a)     The claim by Telemedia against
                        Crédit Agricole is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_270-p2_b"></a>(b)     The claim by Crédit Agricole against Mr Yeh is
                        dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_271"></a>271    I will hear parties on costs unless
                    agreement is reached.</p>
