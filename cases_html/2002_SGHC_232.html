</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        On 23 December 2001 at

12.50am the police conducted a raid on Tiananmen KTV &amp; Lounge Pte Ltd, situated at No.

407 Havelock Road. Chia Sze Chang, the appellant, was a co-owner of the entertainment

establishment at this time. Due to three breaches of the Public Entertainment and Meetings

Act (Cap 257) s 19(1)(c), the appellant was charged on three counts. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        The first charge, was that

the appellant had failed to ensure that the singers did not sit with the customers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        The second and third

charges, was that the appellant had failed to ensure that the customers would only be

served drinks by persons who were listed on the establishment’s register.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        The appellant was convicted

on all three charges. District Judge Kow Keng Siong imposed a fine of $9,000, in default

two months imprisonment, on each charge. The total fine was therefore $27,000 which the

appellant has since paid.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        The appellant appealed

against conviction. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Facts as to the first charge</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        The following were the

facts as found by the trial judge. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        Staff Sgt Wong Vee Kong,

the prosecution’s first witness, entered the Tiananmen KTV &amp; Lounge at 12.50am on

23 December 2001. He was in plain clothes and was accompanied by a group of officers, also

in plain clothes. Due to his seniority, Staff Sgt Wong led the group. Staff Sgt Wong

surveyed the premises and spotted some goings-on in KTV room 18, where he observed a woman

dancing with a customer. He also observed that two more women were chatting and sitting

with some other customers in the same room. These observations prompted Staff Sgt

Wong’s to enter the room whereupon he identified himself as a police officer. In the

course of his questioning and the subsequent arrests, Staff Sgt Wong identified the two

women who were sitting with the customers as Liu Hong Lian (Liu) and Zhang Chong Ling

(Zhang). It was undisputed that these two women were employed as singers by the appellant.

The Licensing Conditions for Nightclubs/Cocktail Lounges/Discotheques/Restaurants states

that :</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The licensee shall ensure that the singers do not sit or dance with the

    customers.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As against the dancer, Gao Hong Mei, no subsequent action was taken as

Staff Sgt Wong was satisfied that she was brought in as a guest.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appellant’s challenge on conviction under the first charge </p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        The appellant disputed the

trial judge’s finding that Zhang and Liu were sitting with the customers, but did not

provide any evidence to persuade this court to disregard trial judge’s findings on

this matter. The district judge stated at pages 11 and 12 of his grounds of decision:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the present case, if Staff Sgt Wong’s evidence is believed, the

    ingredients of [the first charge] would have been satisfied. Having carefully considered

    the matter, I found Staff Sgt Wong to be a reliable witness and that it is inconceivable

    that he could have been mistaken about seeing Liu and Zhang.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">There was nothing in the appellant’s submission nor in anything

the trial judge said on this matter that could persuade this court to alter the trial

judge’s findings. In <i>Ang Jwee Herng v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61262&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 2 SLR 474</a> I re-stated the

following principle: </p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is settled law that an appellate court will be slow to overturn

    findings of fact by the trial judge especially when an assessment of the credibility and

    veracity of the witness has been made.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This principle has been used in a whole host of case law - <i>Shamsul

bin Abdullah v PP</i> MA145/2002; <i>Lim Ah Poh v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6012&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 713</a> at 719; <i>Teo

<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        The three reasons given by

the trial judge as to why he came to the conclusion that the two singers, Zhang and Liu,

were sitting with the customers were sound. The trial judge stated that Staff Sgt Wong had

enough observation time before entering room 18 to confirm that the women were sitting

with the customers. Secondly, the trial judge stated there was not any evidence produced

by the appellant to show that Staff Sgt Wong was less than diligent in his observation

skills. The appellant’s contention that Staff Sgt Wong was totally fixated on the

dancer and not on the women sitting with the customers was totally speculative, and the

trial judge was quite right to dispose of such a far-fetched theory. Thirdly, Staff Sgt

Wong wasted no time in checking on the three women in room 18. During the checking, the

two women who were sitting with the customers produced their professional visit passes . </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        The appellant did not

dispute that Zhang and Liu were singers employed at his KTV Lounge. For these reasons,

there could be no dispute as to the trial judge’s findings that these singers sat

with the customers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        The appellant had a second

argument which challenged his conviction under the first charge. He contended that the

trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the unavailability of Liu and Zhang

was not fatal to the prosecution’s case. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        Zhang and Liu returned to

China before the start of the trial in the district court. The two of them had insisted on

returning home. As the trial judge observed, the authorities in Singapore had no power to

detain them as they were not immigration offenders.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        The unavailability of

Zhang and Liu as witnesses during the trial could not work to extinguish the

appellant’s culpability. The reason why the prosecution did not call Zhang and Liu

was because had left the country and not because their presence as trial witnesses would

jeopardise the prosecution’s case. This was addressed by the trial judge and there

was no reason to second-guess his application of the law on the matter. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        No adverse inference could

also be drawn against the prosecution under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act. I

held in <i>R Yoganathan v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49459&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 264</a> at 278 that, although the prosecution

did not call certain witnesses to give evidence and likewise declined to produce PW1 for

further cross-examination at the close of its case, the presumption under s116

illustration (g) of the Evidence Act did not operate. This was because the witnesses who

were not produced were not essential to the prosecution’s case, and neither did the

prosecution withhold evidence from the court or the appellant. Important for our purposes

in this case was the fact that the adverse inference under s 116 illustration (g) of the

Evidence Act is discretionary. Illustration (g) under s116 reads:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">..... that evidence which could be and is not produced would if

    produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it</p></blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">With the guidance of <i>R Yoganathan</i>, no adverse inference should

be drawn from the fact that Zhang and Liu returned to China. No ill-motivation on the part

of the prosecution can be latched onto the women’s innocent desire to return home. I

ruled in <i>Ang Jwee Herng</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61262&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 2 SLR 474</a><i> </i>that the prosecution has no

obligation to call any particular witness, unless the failure to do so could be shown to

be motivated by an intention to hinder or hamper the defence. This principle consolidated

itself in the judgments in <i>Chua Keem Long v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9947&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 510</a> and <i>Roy S

Selvarajah v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46953&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 517</a>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        Of importance was the fact

that the trial judge found Staff Sgt Wong a credible witness and that his testimony was

sufficient to confirm that Zhang and Liu were sitting with the customers. For these

reasons, the appellant’s claim that there were insufficient witnesses must fail.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        The appellant’s third

challenge to his conviction under the first charge was that the trial judge imposed on him

too great a burden to ensure that his singers did not sit with customers. He listed out

all the ways in which he tried to prevent his singers from sitting with customers. Amongst

the ‘preventive measures’ he listed in his submission were :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">a    All employees must have a valid work

    permit</p>
<p align="justify">b    No one below 18 years old is allowed into the

    lounge</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">c    The staff is closely supervised by the

    ‘Mummys’ in the lounge</p>
<p align="justify">d    The singers employed are briefed and constantly

    reminded that they are not to sit with customers</p>
<p align="justify">e    The singers are further briefed and reminded not

    even to mingle with customers, even in passageways or by any form of chit-chatting</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The appellant further stated that he personally walked around the

lounge to ensure that no conditions of the licence were breached. Thus, the

appellant’s argument was that, in light of all these preventive measures, he should

be excused from liability since he fulfilled the condition ‘the licensee <i>shall

ensure</i> that the singers do not sit with the customers.’ I found that the

appellant did not reach the threshold needed to fulfil the ‘<i>shall ensure</i>’

condition. It was my belief that the appellant knew of the goings-on in the KTV rooms but

turned a blind eye to them. If the appellant said, as he did, that he regularly did his

rounds to ensure that no breach took place, why did it only take a short while for Staff

Sgt Wong to realise that there was a clear breach in room 18? Could it be that the

breaches only occurred when the big boss was away? (in this case, the appellant was away

from the lounge when the raid happened) – I did not think so. This was because the

appellant had stated that he was not the only person who did the patrolling. The

‘Mummys’ or ‘Mamasans’ patrolled also. If the KTV rooms were brightly

lit, the insides of which were able to be seen from the corridors, as has been deduced

from the evidence, why would it be so difficult to ensure that no singer sat with a

customer? The appellant and his ‘Mummys’ most certainly do do their rounds of

patrol but turn a blind eye to the goings-on in the KTV rooms. I would say that he is

guilty of Nelsonian knowledge – he knows the true facts of things but turns a blind

eye to them as Lord Nelson did in putting his telescope to his blind eye and declaring,

‘I see no ships, I see no ships.’ The appellant was guilty of such knowledge

– he knew of the trend of singers sitting with customers. At the time of the raid

only 25 rooms were occupied. It was not difficult to ensure that singers did not sit with

customers in 25 rooms, if the patrols are done diligently. Furthermore, the appellant

stated in cross-examination that he had only 8 singers, and that he took just five to ten

minutes to complete his patrol. There were only eight singers to keep an eye on. And the

patrol only took five to ten minutes. How difficult could it be to keep the place in

check? – Not difficult; if the intention is to keep the place in check. From what the

appellant stated on his own accord, it is my view that he ‘turned a blind eye’

to what was really going on in the rooms. For this reason, the ‘shall ensure’

condition had not been met.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        This was far from making

liability, stemming from the breach of the licensing conditions, strict. Here, the

appellant, although taking the preventive measures, did not possess the intention of

stamping out the breaches of the conditions under the licence. The appellant had Nelsonian

knowledge – he turned a blind eye. The preventive actions were not coupled with a

genuine desire to prevent the breaches. This was where the appellant counsel’s

argument fell short.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        Thus, the appellant’s

contention that he took all reasonable and necessary steps to prevent the breach from

happening was off-tangent. What threw it off was his knowledge.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        For these reasons, the

appeal against conviction under the first charge was dismissed.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Facts as to the second and third charges </p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        On the night of the raid,

Narcotics Officer Gopinathan (NO Gopinathan) was instructed to enter KTV room 19. This he

did. There were four male customers and two women in the room. NO Gopinathan identified

himself and stated that he was in plain clothes. In his evidence, he stated that the two

women were sitting beside the male customers. After NO Gopinathan had done the initial

investigation, he returned to Central Division. The two women in room 19 followed him. The

case was then handed over to officer Adrian Oong Chun Chang. The two women, Li and Dong,

requested to return to China. As they were not found to be immigration offenders, they

were released.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        It was the

prosecution’s case, which was agreed to by the trial judge, that these two women were

the ones who were sitting and serving the four customers that night. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        The issue here stemmed

from the following condition which a licensee must fulfil. According to the

‘Licensing Conditions for Nightclubs/Cocktail

Lounges/Discotheques/Restaurants/Bars’:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The licensee shall ensure that only <i>registered</i> waitresses,

    bar-girls, and lounge-hostesses are permitted to serve customers.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Dong and Li were not registered and, on the strength of the prosecution

witnesses, the trial judge found the appellant in breach of the above condition. The

appellant contested this finding on several grounds.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appellant’s challenge on convictions under the second and

third charge respectively</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        The appellant contended

that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that both Li and Dong had been

sufficiently identified. The arrest report showed that, the two women were Dong and Li. As

NO Gopinathan stated in his examination-in-chief:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">After I had finished, I handed over the particulars to

    one of the In-Charge and escorted the females to the holding area. We then went back to

    Central Division. <i>The two females from room 19 followed me</i>. Officer Adrian Oong

    Chun Chang lodged an arrest report. I gave the particulars to Oong who lodged the report.

    I verified the arrest report. (my emphasis)</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">There was hardly any slip in the correct identification of these two

women, Dong and Li.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        The appellant also

contended that the trial judge erred in law and fact by accepting and giving too much

weight to the evidence of Cheok Ah Lek (Cheok) and Liew Fatt Nien (Liew), who were two of

the four customers in room 19 that night. Liew and Cheok were prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        To this end, it is apt to

re-emphasise the trial judge’s own apprehensions toward Liew’s testimony that

Dong and Li were definitely the women in room 19. The trial judge’s apprehension

stemmed from the fact that Liew had confirmed the two women as the two women in room 19 a

good six months after the raid. The important point here was that the trial judge did take

this into consideration. It is apt to cite a key part of his ruling on this matter:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I am of the view that <i><b>even without Liew’s identification

    evidence</b></i>, the identification of Li and Dong as the two women sitting with Cheok,

    Liew and their friends at the material time had been properly established….Staff Sgt

    Oong Chun Chang corroborated Narcotics Officer Gopinathan’s evidence relating to the

    making of the arrest report (exhibit P10). According to the arrest report, (a) the two

    women arrested were Li Jin Hong and Dong Jing Yi, and (b) the two women were sitting

    together with Kwek Leng Kee (Kwek) and Ong Teng Koon (Ong) (the other two customers).

    During the trial, the defence did not challenge at all these aspects of the

    prosecution’s case. (my emphasis)</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">This, the trial judge stated, was enough to overcome the few

inconsistencies between the evidence of Liew, Cheok, and NO Gopinathan. There was nothing

submitted which should prompt this Court to second-guess the learned judge’s findings

on the matter. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        The appellant’s third

challenge as regards the second and third charges was that the trial judge erred in law

and in fact in finding that the prosecution’s failure to call Li and Dong, and Kwek

and Ong (the other two customers) was not fatal to the prosecution’s case. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        The trial judge

specifically tackled the issue of the absence of these four persons at trial. He stated,

at para 44 of his grounds of decision:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I am of the opinion that the fact that neither Li, Dong, Kwek, nor Ong

    gave evidence did not create a lacuna in the Prosecution’s case as there was direct

    and credible evidence from other material witnesses.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">With this statement in mind, the credibility of the material witnesses

which included Narcotics Officer Gopinathan and customer Cheok ought not to be

second-guessed by this Court. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        The appellant’s

fourth challenge as regards the second and third charges was that the trial judge erred in

law and in fact in finding that Li and Dong were serving customers and working in room 19.

The issue here was that Li and Dong were not registered – there was no dispute as to

this. Couple this fact with the following finding of the trial judge’s and it was

very difficult to allow such a claim by the appellant. At para 46 of his grounds of

decision, the trial judge stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">There is clear evidence that Li and Dong were serving

    customers in KTV room 19. Both Cheok and Liew gave evidence that during their karaoke

    session, the women were (a) sitting with the customers, (b) pouring drinks for them, and

    (c) joining in the singing. Their evidence is corroborated by Narcotics Officer Gopinathan

    who testified that at the time of entering KTV room 19, he heard some loud music from the

    room. After entering, Narcotics Officer Gopinathan observed two women, later established

    to be Li and Dong, to be sitting with the customers and that there were some glasses and

    liquor bottles in the room.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The trial judge’s reservation toward Liew’s evidence was only

limited to his identification evidence as regards Li and Dong. Quite simply, therefore,

the women were not on the register but were pouring and serving the four men drinks.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29        But could Li and Dong have

been guests of the men? – Or could the two women have entered the KTV lounge without

the appellant’s management knowing about it? However, it was clear that the trial

judge was satisfied with the fact that Li and Dong were not the guests of the four men,

and there was no reason why this court should differ from this conclusion. What about the

theory that Li and Dong could have slipped into the KTV Lounge? – The very testimony

of the appellant closed the door on such an argument. The following verbatim, at page 47

of the notes of evidence (cross-examination of appellant), was telling:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q You have advised or alerted your reception staff to stop people from

    sneaking in to enjoy KTV facilities, at company’s expense?</p>
<p align="justify">A Yes. Instructions given to reception to ascertain whether person

    entering is a customer or otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">Q Often difficult to ensure no outsider enters KTV because you have

    only three reception staff?</p>
<p align="justify">A Disagree.</p>
<p align="justify">Q At anytime, how many receptionists on duty at the counter?</p>
<p align="justify">A At least one.</p>
<p align="justify">Q Staff at counter would be able to see who enters?</p>
<p align="justify">A Normally, we would have a captain to entertain them. If the

    receptionist leads the customer to the rooms, the captain would be at the reception.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">If the KTV Lounge was as tight in its procedure as to who was allowed

in and who was not, as the appellant suggested in his testimony, how then could Li and

Dong have slipped by the checks? The fact of the matter was that they did not even need to

sneak in, as their presence was known to the management. To this end, I agreed with the

trial judge’s assessment, at para 52 of his grounds of decision, that:<font size="3"> </font></p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">On the totality of the evidence, I find that Li and Dong had been

    permitted to serve at the Lounge by the appellant and his management.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">To argue that Dong and Li were free-lance hostesses and should

therefore not have to be registered in order to serve was to make a nonsense of the

registering condition. The register exists to keep track of the employment arrangements in

the lounge industry. If it were otherwise, there would only be a handful of registered

servers and a whole host of free-lancers. For these reasons, this last contention of the

appellant’s must fail.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30        The appellant’s

record offered him no favours. He had been fined no less than six times for breach of the

Public Entertainment and Meetings Act over a period of 12 years. The last sentence was

passed on 5 November 2001 for providing public entertainment in contravention of a

condition in a licence under s18(1)(c) of the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act. The

fine of $8500 was paid in full, as were all his other fines. Separate from his breaches of

the Public Entertainment Act was his selling of intoxicating liquor to under aged persons

in a licensed premises – for which he was fined $800 on 4 January 1990. Again, he

paid this fine in full. We must stop these licensees from treating fines as part of their

business losses. Such an attitude belittles the law. A heavy fine will wake up licensees

in the same position as the appellant to the fact that fines too can be costly and, as a

deterrent sentence, the $27,000 fine imposed by the district judge is a good start.</p>
