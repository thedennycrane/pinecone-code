<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of an
                    Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) dismissing the defendant’s
                    application to set aside an adjudication determination dated 7 July 2010
                    (“the Adjudication Determination”) made under the Building and
                    Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the SOPA”). The defendant’s application was made in
                    response to the plaintiff’s application (by way of Originating Summons
                    No 783 of 2010) to enforce the Adjudication Determination as a judgment
                    under section 27 of the SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant raised three issues before the AR,
                    who decided all three of them against him. Before me, the defendant only
                    appealed against the AR’s findings on two of the three issues. After
                    hearing the arguments from both parties, I agreed with the AR on one issue but
                    disagreed with him on the other. In the result, I allowed the defendant’s
                    appeal and his application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As the Adjudication Determination was for the
                    sum of only $125,450.40, the parties required leave under section 34(2)(a) of
                    the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) if they wished to
                    appeal to the Court of Appeal. The defendant applied for leave to appeal against
                    my decision on the issue on which I agreed with the AR and ruled against him.
                    The defendant’s application was however contingent on the plaintiff also
                    seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. One day after the defendant
                    filed his application, the plaintiff did apply for such leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The SOPA has been the subject of several High
                    Court decisions. In my opinion, a decision of the Court of Appeal would help
                    clarify the law on payment claims under the SOPA for the construction industry.
                    I therefore gave both parties leave to appeal despite the fact that they had
                    already proceeded to litigate their dispute in court. Both the plaintiff and the
                    defendant have filed their appeals accordingly (Civil Appeal No 46 of 2011 and
                    Civil Appeal No 44 of 2011 respectively) and I now set out the grounds of my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Brief factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The AR has set out the facts in detail at
                        [3] to [9] of his decision (see <em>Chua Say Eng
                        (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) v Lee Wee Lick
                        Terence @ Li Weili Terence</em> [2010] SGHC 333) (“the
                    AR’s decision”). I will limit my account here to the salient
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff is in the business of building and
                    renovation works. The defendant is a private individual who engaged the
                    plaintiff in August 2008 as the main contractor for the conversion of his
                    two-storey house at 1 Pasir Ris Heights into a three-storey house. Relations
                    soured and the defendant purported to terminate his contract with the plaintiff
                    by way of a letter dated 21 April 2010. In the same letter, the plaintiff
                    was instructed to vacate the construction site by 12 noon on 26 April
                    2010. On 2 June 2010, the plaintiff served “Payment Claim No
                    6” on the defendant. The defendant did not serve a payment
                    response.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 18 June 2010, the plaintiff served the
                    defendant with a “Notice of Intention to Apply for Adjudication”
                    in compliance with section 13(2) of the SOPA. On 22 June 2010, the
                    plaintiff filed an adjudication application (“the Adjudication
                    Application”) with the Singapore Mediation Centre (“the
                    SMC”). The SMC served the Adjudication Application on the defendant that
                    same day. The defendant did not lodge an adjudication response with the
                    SMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 7 July 2010, the Adjudication Determination
                    was made, awarding the plaintiff $125,450.40. As stated above, the plaintiff
                    applied to enforce this and hence the defendant’s application to set it
                    aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The AR identified the three issues which arose
                    before him as follows (see [10] of the
                    AR’s decision):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether Payment Claim No 6 was a valid payment
                            claim under the SOPA;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether Payment Claim No 6 was served in
                            accordance with the SOPA;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether Payment Claim No 6, if it had been served
                            in accordance with the SOPA, was nevertheless served out of
                        time.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The AR decided all three issues against the defendant and dismissed his
                    application to set aside the Adjudication Determination. Before me, on the
                    defendant’s appeal against the AR’s dismissal of his application,
                    the defendant only contested the AR’s findings on the first and the third
                    issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary issue: what should the court review?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The preliminary question which these two
                    issues raised was whether the court ought to even review the Adjudicator’s
                    decision on the said issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The earlier cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Following Judith Prakash J’s
                    (“Prakash J’s”) decision in <em>Chip Hup Hup
                        Kee Construction Pte Ltd v Ssangyong Engineering &amp; Construction Co
                        Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 658 (“<em>Chip
                        Hup</em>”), it would appear that the two issues do not pertain
                    to whether an adjudicator has properly assumed jurisdiction and thus should not
                    be considered by the court. Prakash J held the following at [54]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54     <em>I was unable to accept
                            the respondent's argument that the jurisdiction of the Adjudicator was
                            determined according to whether the claimant had followed the
                            requirements of the SOP Act in connection with the form and content of
                            the payment claim and the time at which it had to be served, or
                            not</em>. I took the view that the Adjudicator's jurisdiction, in
                        the sense of his power to hear and determine the adjudication, could not
                        depend on such adventitious elements. <em>It appeared to me
                            that, as the claimant submitted, the Adjudicator's jurisdiction arose
                            from his appointment by an authorised nominating body under s 14(1) of
                            the SOP Act and from his acceptance of such appointment. Whether the
                            payment claim was in proper order or not would not have an impact on the
                            Adjudicator's jurisdiction</em>, though of course if it was not in
                        order, the Adjudicator would be able to throw out the claim on that basis.
                            <em>Once an appointment had been made and confirmed to
                            the parties by the authorised nominating body under s 14(3),
                            jurisdiction would have been conferred on the Adjudicator in relation to
                            that particular adjudication application</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At [55], the judge made
                    reference to two New South Wales Supreme Court decisions and went on to hold at
                        [56]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56     <em>Similarly, under our
                            legislation, the jurisdiction of an adjudicator stems from his
                            appointment. It does not stem from a properly completed and served
                            payment claim. The powers and functions of the adjudicator come from s
                            16 of the SOP Act and not from any action on the part of the
                            claimant</em>. The respondent's argument in respect of the
                        Adjudicator's jurisdiction was analogous to an argument that the High
                        Court's jurisdiction to hear any particular dispute depends on whether the
                        writ of summons or other originating process is in proper form when in fact
                        the court's jurisdiction comes from the provisions of the SCJA or other
                        relevant legislation, depending on the nature of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Therefore, according to Prakash J, an
                    adjudicator obtains jurisdiction to hear and determine an adjudication
                    application as soon as he accepts the appointment made by the SMC. Applying that
                    to the case before me, it appears that as an adjudicator’s jurisdiction
                    does not stem from a “properly completed and served payment
                    claim”, this court should not be reviewing the Adjudicator’s
                    decision on the two issues raised in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     About two months after her decision in
                        <em>Chip Hup</em>, Prakash J set out her views in
                        <em>SEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 733 (“<em>SEF
                        Construction</em>”) on the court’s role when asked to set
                    aside an adjudication determination or a judgment arising from the same. She
                    said at [42]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42     Accordingly, instead of reviewing the
                        merits (in any direct or indirect fashion), <em>it is my view
                            that the court's role must be limited to supervising the appointment and
                            conduct of the adjudicator to ensure that the statutory provisions
                            governing such appointment and conduct are adhered to and that the
                            process of the adjudication, rather than the substance, is
                            proper</em>. After all, in any case, even if the adjudicator does
                        make an error of fact or law in arriving at his adjudication determination,
                        such error can be rectified or compensated for in subsequent arbitration or
                        court proceedings initiated in accordance with the contract between the
                        claimant and the respondent and intended to resolve all contractual disputes
                        that have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     To further elucidate the limits of the
                    court’s role, Prakash J had regard to the New South Wales Court of
                    Appeal (“NSW CA”) case of <em>Brodyn Pty Ltd v
                        Davenport</em> [2004] NSWCA 394 (“<em>Brodyn</em>”). In <em>Brodyn</em>,
                    Hodgson JA first stated (at [51]) that
                    the scheme of the equivalent New South Wales Act (“the NSW Act”)
                    “appears strongly against the availability of judicial review on the
                    basis of non-jurisdictional error of law.” The judge went on (at
                        [53]) to consider what the
                    conditions for the existence of an adjudicator’s determination
                    were:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The basic and essential requirements appear to include the

<p class="Judg-1">As for more detailed statutory requirements of the NSW Act such as

                    the time when an adjudication application can be made and as to its
                    contents”, Hodgson JA disapproved of the approach which asked
                    “whether an error by the adjudicator in determining whether any of these
                    requirements is satisfied is a jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional
                    error” as he thought that approach “tended to cast the net too
                    widely”. He preferred to ask “whether a requirement being
                    considered was intended by the legislature to be an essential pre-condition for
                    the existence of an adjudicator's determination.” (see <em>Brodyn</em> at [54])</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    ... <em>However, the discussion on

                    included the service by the claimant on the respondent of a payment claim,
                    Prakash J made clear at [46] of

                            have indicated earlier, in my opinion the legislature has manifested an

                        <em>SEF Construction</em>. The respondent in the
                    adjudication proceedings there applied to set aside the adjudication
                    determination on the basis that the payment claim it was served with
                    (“Payment Claim 1”) was not a valid payment claim under the SOPA.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It was not my place to determine whether Payment Claim 1 was a

                        Claim 1 had been served by AMA and <em>whether it was

                    (“Lee J”) decided the case of <em>Sungdo

                    [2010] 3 SLR 459 (“<em>Sungdo
                    Engineering</em>”). An appeal was filed against Lee J’s
                    decision but was subsequently withdrawn. There, the respondent in the
                    adjudication proceedings applied to set aside the adjudication order on the
                    basis that the letter which the claimant purported to be a payment claim
                    (“the 2008 Letter”) did not in fact constitute a payment claim
                    under the SOPA. Lee J found notable the conclusion of the 2008 Letter (see
                        <em>Sungdo Engineering</em> at [27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please therefore let us have your payment.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">He decided (at [23]) that the
                    2008 Letter was not a payment claim under the SOPA, even though it arguably
                    contained the information prescribed in the SOPA and the regulations made
                    thereunder, for the following five reasons.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Lee J’s elaboration of reason (e) (at
                        [28]) provides some background to
                    the case and I set it out in full here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28     This leads to reason (e). If the
                        defendant's position as to what constitutes a Payment Claim is correct, it
                        had made four prior demands for payment of the four invoices after which it
                        did not proceed to apply for adjudication. It then attempted to claim
                        payment through its solicitors, which was also not followed up with an
                        adjudication application. The defendant even commenced a suit to pursue in
                        the High Court the payment it was unable to persuade the plaintiff to pay by
                        way of its four invoices and its solicitors' letter of demand. And well into
                        the pleadings stage, between two public holidays - Christmas and New Year -
                        the defendant delivered the 2008 Letter which did not, on its face, state
                        that it is a payment claim under the Act. That letter was written in an
                        informal manner without the sense of urgency that a Payment Claim demands of
                        a respondent. <em>To hold that a document such as the 2008
                            Letter amounts to a Payment Claim under these circumstances would leave
                            ample scope for potential claimants to ambush respondents by submitting
                            document after document and applying for adjudication the minute the
                            respondent fails to provide a payment response. It cannot be the
                            intention of Parliament for the Act to operate in this
                        manner</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Significantly, Lee J disagreed with
                    Prakash J’s statements at [56] of <em>Chip Hup</em> (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above), stating (at [32]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... While I agree that the jurisdiction of the adjudicator is not vested
                        until his appointment by an ANB (“authorised nominating
                        body”), <em>I am, with respect, unable to agree that
                            jurisdiction is not affected by an invalid Payment Claim or service
                            thereof</em>. The power of the ANB to appoint an adjudicator
                        arises from the receipt of an adjudication application from a claimant, and
                        that is predicated by a whole chain of events initiated by the service of a
                        Payment Claim by the claimant on the respondent under s 10 of the Act. It
                        must follow that if the claimant had failed to serve a Payment Claim, or to
                        serve something that constitutes a Payment Claim, the power to appoint an
                        adjudicator for that particular claim has not arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As for Prakash J’s view at [46] of <em>SEF Construction</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) that whether or not a
                    purported payment claim is actually a payment claim under the SOPA is an issue
                    for the adjudicator and not the court, Lee J went on to say at [34] that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In principle, if the validity of a Payment Claim goes to jurisdiction,
                        I do not see how a court is precluded from examining this issue on judicial
                        review and I would, with respect, disagree with this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Lee J then distinguished <em>SEF Construction</em> on the basis that in any event, the
                    2008 Letter did not <em>purport</em> to be a payment claim
                    under the SOPA as nothing therein stated that it was so. Finally,
                    notwithstanding Lee J’s disagreement in principle with Prakash J, he
                    stated that in practice, where a document did purport to be a payment claim
                    under the SOPA, the court should only review an adjudicator’s decision
                    that it was indeed a valid payment claim under the SOPA on the basis of
                        <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness (see <em>Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury
                        Corporation</em> [1948] 1 KB 223). In support, Lee J
                    cited the same passage from <em>Brodyn</em> which was cited
                    at [46] of <em>SEF
                        Construction</em>, highlighting Hodgson JA’s
                    qualification:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... If there is a document served by a claimant on a respondent that
                        purports to be a payment claim under the Act, question as to whether the
                        document complies in all respects with the requirements of the Act <em>are generally, in my opinion, for the adjudicator to
                            decide</em>. Many of these questions can involve doubtful
                        questions of fact and law; and as I have indicated earlier, in my opinion
                        the legislature has manifested an intention that the existence of a
                        determination should not turn on answers to questions of this kind. However,
                        I do not need to express a final view on this.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Chase Oyster</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Since then, a different NSW CA from that which
                    decided <em>Brodyn</em> has decided the case of <em>Chase Oyster Bar v Hamo Industries</em>
                    [2010] NSWCA 190 (“<em>Chase
                    Oyster</em>”). Section 17(2) of the NSW Act provides that a
                    claimant cannot make an adjudication application unless the respondent is
                    notified, within 20 business days after payment is due, of the claimant’s
                    intention to apply for adjudication. In <em>Chase
                        Oyster</em>, the claimant gave notice to the respondent outside the 20
                    business day limit. The adjudicator quite irrationally (see [242]-[243] of
                        <em>Chase Oyster</em>) concluded that notice had been
                    given to the respondent within the 20 business day period. In the course of
                    answering the specific questions removed into the Court of Appeal,
                    McDougall J (sitting in the NSW CA) stated (at [286]) that his conclusions
                    suggested that an order should be made to quash the adjudicator’s
                    determination, unless there was some discretionary reason to the
                    contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Notable in the <em>Chase
                        Oyster</em> decision were the comments which the NSW CA made regarding
                    the decision in <em>Brodyn</em>. The background to some of
                    those comments included the High Court of Australia’s decision in
                        <em>Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission</em>
                    [2010] HCA 1. The implications of that decision were neatly summarised
                    by Spigelman CJ at [29] in
                        <em>Chase Oyster</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    The centrality of the distinction between
                            jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error had been identified by the
                            High Court in <em>Craig v State of South
                                Australia </em>[1995] HCA 58; (1995) 184 CLR
                            163. The significance of <em>Kirk </em>is that it has given this distinction a
                            constitutional dimension in State law, to the same general effect as had
                            earlier been established for Commonwealth law. That has placed this
                            distinction at the centre of Australian administrative law
                            jurisprudence, <em>in a manner which is not consistent
                                with the reasoning in Brodyn, on one view of that
                                reasoning</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The said inconsistency was Hodgson JA’s
                    seeming preference for the higher review threshold of the failure to meet
                    “basic and essential pre-conditions” over the lower threshold of
                    “jurisdictional error”. “Basic and essential
                    pre-conditions” appeared to be a subset of “jurisdictional
                    errors.” This understanding of Hodgson JA’s decision in <em>Brodyn</em> was explained by Spigelman CJ at [27] of <em>Chase
                        Oyster</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    The third consideration is of particular
                            significance. <em>The impact of the judgment
                                in Kirk on his Honour’s reasons arises from his
                                rejection at</em> [54] <em>of the applicability
                                of the distinction between “jurisdictional” and
                                “non-jurisdictional” error, on the basis that it
                                “cast the net too widely”</em>. His Honour went
                            on to apply a test as to what statutory requirements constituted
                            “an essential pre-condition”. That statement could be
                            understood as the equivalent of “jurisdictional error”,
                            but it appears from the passage quoted at [22] above, that that may not
                            be what his Honour had in mind. <em>The concept of
                                “an essential precondition” may have been intended to
                                be encompassed within, but narrower than, the scope of
                                “jurisdictional error”</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Additionally, as the AR pointed out at
                        [13] of his decision,
                    McDougall J made the following related critique at [149]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">149    The decision in <em>Brodyn</em> appears to assume that there is a
                            distinction between a basic and essential requirement for the existence
                            of an adjudicator’s determination and a jurisdictional condition,
                            or jurisdictional fact. <em>However, the decision does
                                not analyse the relevant requirements of the Act in terms of
                                jurisdiction; the framework of analysis was restricted by the search
                                for basic and essential conditions of
                        validity</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As for what then constitutes jurisdictional
                    error, Spigelman CJ had this to say (at [33]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    There is no single test or theory or logical
                            process by which the distinction between jurisdictional and
                            non-jurisdictional error can be determined. (See M Aronson et
                                al <em>Judicial Review of
                                Administrative </em>Action,

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The court can review the issues raised in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     To what extent should the court interfere with
                    an adjudicator’s determinations? A liberal approach would invite more
                    setting aside applications and undermine the statutory purpose of creating a
                    speedy and low cost adjudication process (see <em>Sungdo
                        Engineering</em> at [10])
                    while turning away from putting right erroneous adjudication determinations
                    could create the impression that the court countenances injustice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Returning to the case at hand, I answer the
                    preliminary question in the positive. First, I agree with Lee J’s
                    statements at [32] of <em>Sungdo Engineering</em> (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    above) that in principle, the court may review an adjudicator’s decision
                    in respect of whether a document properly constitutes a payment claim under the
                    SOPA and that where a document purports to be a payment claim under the SOPA,
                    the court should only review an adjudicator’s decision that it was indeed
                    a valid payment claim under the SOPA on the basis of <em>Wednesbury</em> unreasonableness (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Second, I note that in <em>Sungdo Engineering</em>, Lee J took the view (also at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>) that the service of a payment claim should
                    be reviewable by a court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... While I agree that the jurisdiction of the adjudicator is not vested
                        until his appointment by an (“authorised nominating body”),
                            <em>I am, with respect, unable to agree that jurisdiction
                            is not affected by an invalid Payment Claim</em><b><em>or service</em></b><em>thereof. ..</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I also agree with this. The review of the adjudicator’s decision
                    as to whether a payment claim was properly served includes reviewing his
                    decision as to whether a payment claim was served within the prescribed time. In
                    so holding, I have regard to Spigelman CJ’s views on the importance of
                    time limits in the NSW Act. Having gone through a long list of time provisions
                    in the previous paragraph of his judgment in <em>Chase
                        Oyster</em>, the judge held at [47]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    This detailed series of time provisions is
                            carefully calibrated to ensure expeditious resolution of any dispute
                            with respect to payments in the building industry. <em>The time limits are a critical aspect of the scheme’s purpose
                                to ensure prompt resolution of disputes about payment. It is
                                commercially important that each party knows precisely where they
                                stand at any point of time. Such certainty is of considerable
                                commercial value</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In line with those views, I think it would be helpful for the court to
                    clarify issues regarding time limits so as to provide certainty for parties
                    proceeding under the SOPA.</p>

                attached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Payment Claim No 6 falls within the meaning of
                    a payment claim under the SOPA. Unlike the 2008 Letter in <em>Sungdo Engineering</em>, Payment Claim No 6 here specified clearly on
                    its face that it was a payment claim. It was a business-like document. From its
                    contents, there could have been no doubt that it was claiming that a sum of
                    money was due. As the contract had been terminated by the defendant, the
                    inclusion of the date 26 April 2010 also made it clear that it was the
                    final bill for the works done as the plaintiff had been directed to clear out of
                    the site by that date (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Payment claims do not need to expressly refer to the SOPA to be
                valid</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The obvious objection to this proposition is
                    that if Payment Claim No 6 made no reference to the SOPA, how could it have
                    purported to be a valid payment claim <em>under the
                        SOPA</em>? However, as Lee J also noted at [17] of <em>Sungdo
                        Engineering</em>, there is no requirement for a payment claim to
                    expressly state that it is made under the SOPA for it to be a valid payment
                    claim under the said Act. At [18],
                    Lee J went on to observe that our SOPA departed from the NSW Act which
                    specifically provides under its section 13(2)(c) that a valid payment claim must
                    state that it is made under the NSW Act. The judge also noted a comment by
                    Mr Chow Kok Fong (“Mr Chow”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... However there is an interesting comment in Chow Kok Fong,
                            <em>Security of Payments and Construction
                            Adjudication</em> (LexisNexis, 2005) at p 134. After noting that
                        there is no requirement in our legislation, unlike the NSW Act, to declare
                        that the claim is made under the Act, the learned author said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is understood that, during consultations leading to the drafting of
                            the [Building Construction Industry Security of Payment] Bill, the
                            Building and Construction Authority accepted the suggestion from the
                            subcontractors and suppliers lobby that such a requirement may
                            conceivably result in creating a contentious atmosphere in the
                            relationships between a main contractor and subcontractors straight
                            away. It is difficult to follow this line of argument. It will be
                            appreciated that, in the normal course of a business, various letters,
                            claims, quotations, negotiation proposals and exchanges will be
                            encountered between the parties. A claimant may submit a proposal for a
                            payment arrangement or furnish a draft progress payment claim as a
                            template for working through the computations and prices with the
                            quantity surveyor on a project. In the absence of a definitive statement
                            of intention, it is conceivable that a payment claim may be mistaken by
                            the respondent for any one of these exchanges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The defendant did not seek to argue that the
                    adjudicator’s finding that Payment Claim No 6 was valid under the SOPA was
                    unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. As stated above, I am of the opinion that
                    Payment Claim No 6 was a valid payment claim under the SOPA. To this extent, I
                    agreed with the AR on the first issue determined by him (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The requirement that a claimant must communicate his intention that a
                claim is a payment claim under the SOPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Finally, I ought to address the
                    defendant’s arguments on this issue which were essentially premised on
                    Lee J’s statements at [22] of
                        <em>Sungdo Engineering</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22     I would therefore hold that for any
                        document to amount to a Payment Claim, not only must it comply with the
                        prescribed requirements for a Payment Claim, it must be intended to be such
                        by the party submitting it and, importantly, such intention must be
                        communicated to the recipient. Whether or not this communication has taken
                        place in each case would be a question of fact to be determined according to
                        the circumstances of that case. Evidence of such communication may come from
                        covering letters, e-mail exchange referring to the document in question or
                        even oral communication. Evidence could well come from the manner in which
                        the respondent had dealt with the document, <em>eg</em>, he gives a payment response. It would not be possible to set
                        out all the circumstances under which a court would hold that such intention
                        has been communicated and each case would have to be determined on the basis
                        of its unique facts. But certainly a statement in the document that it is a
                        payment claim under the Act would be the most effective manner of
                        communicating this intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant emphasized that as a private individual, it was all the
                    more important that the plaintiff’s intention (for the payment claim to be
                    one made under the SOPA) be communicated to him. At [34] of his skeletal submissions, the defendant argued
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Unlike members of the construction industry, it would be surprising
                        for an individual to be unaware [<em>sic</em>] of the
                        intricacies of the SOPA. It is therefore crucial that a party who wishes to
                        serve a payment claim for the purposes of the SOPA make it absolutely clear
                        to that layperson.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, the SOPA does not distinguish between
                    laypersons and members of the construction industry. An opponent to this view
                    might point out that under section 4(2)(a) of the SOPA, contracts relating to
                    residential property are excluded from the application of the SOPA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, I note that in response to a Member of
                    Parliament’s query during the second reading of the SOPA Bill in
                    Parliament, the Minister of State for National Development, Mr Cedric Foo
                    Chee Keng stated the following (<em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (16 November 2004) vol 78 at
                    col 1135:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that renovation works in private
                        residential and commercial buildings be included in the Bill. 
                        Currently, the Bill applies to all construction works including renovation
                        works in commercial buildings.  So I would like to make this
                        clarification.  Only renovation works in residential buildings engaged
                        by private homeowners - be it interior decoration, re-tiling of
                        floors, replacing a set of windows - <em>will not be
                            included in the Bill as they are normally of small contract value and
                            may not be worth the while for homeowners to take their case to an
                            adjudicator</em>.  Such disputes, however, can be resolved
                        through mediation or the Small Claims Tribunal, which will be the proper
                        body to do so.  This is also the practice with other SOP
                        legislation in Australia and the UK.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Further, Christopher Chuah <em>et al, Annotated Guide to the Building and Construction Industry Security
                        of Payment Act 2004</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2004) states at
                    [4.6]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, the [SOPA] will not apply to the carrying out of construction works
                        or supply of goods or services in relation to any residential property
                        within the meaning of the Residential Property Act (Cap. 274), which do not
                        require the approval of the Commission of Building Control under the
                        Building Control Act. This exempted category deals with minor renovation
                        works done by individual home owners. <em>The object of the
                            Act is clearly addressed at larger scale projects where the encumbered
                            cash involved is likely to be substantial</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It appears therefore that section 4(2)(a)
                    exempts renovation works done by home owners from the application of the SOPA
                    because such contracts are generally of small value and not because the
                    potential respondent under the SOPA is a private individual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Coming back to Lee J’s decision that for
                    a document to amount to a valid payment claim under the SOPA, it must be
                    intended to be such by the claimant and such intention must be communicated to
                    the recipient, the Adjudicator viewed this (at [85] of his Determination) as a
                    statement of best practice rather than a requirement of validity under the Act.
                    Indeed, the SOPA does not impose such a requirement for validity. The only
                    formal requirements are found in section 10(3) and reg 5(2) in that every
                    payment claim shall be in writing, identify the relevant contract and contain
                    details of the claimed amount. In any event, as I have found, Payment Claim No 6
                    was clearly intended by the plaintiff to be a payment claim under the SOPA on
                    its face and if the defendant did not realise that, then it was probably a case
                    of him not being aware of the SOPA or its implications.</p>

                    the SOPA, read with reg 5(1) of the Building and Construction Industry

                    SOPR”), establishes a limitation period for the service of payment claims
                    under the SOPA. Section 10(2) of the SOPA states:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Before the AR, counsel for the defendant took the position that the
                    payment claim for work done in April 2010 had to be served by 30 April 2010 (see
                        [24] of the AR’s decision).
                    However, before me, counsel for the defendant submitted that for work done in
                    April 2010, the last day for serving a payment claim was
                    31 May 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The AR’s interpretation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     After citing the NSW CA decision
                        in <em>Fyntray Constructions Pty Ltd v Macind Drainage
                        &amp; Hydraulic Services Pty Ltd</em> [2002] NSWCA
                        238 (“<em>Fyntray</em>”) at
                        [26] of his decision, the AR opined
                    as follows (at [27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The express words of reg 5(1) do not clearly set out a limitation period,
                        … In my view, the true import of reg 5(1) is two-fold. First, since
                        reg 5(1) states that the payment claim must be served by the last day of the
                            (<em>sic</em>) each month <em>following the month in which the contract is made</em>, this
                        means that no payment claim can be served in the month in which the contract
                        is made. This is a sensible position since a plaintiff should generally be
                        expected to complete a certain amount of work before it can make a payment
                        claim. By disallowing the making of a payment claim in the month in which
                        the contract was made, reg 5(1) prevents plaintiffs from swiftly serving
                        payment claims after the completion of merely trivial work. Second, a
                        contract may provide that a payment claim must be served by, on or after a
                        specified day of the month. … In my view, reg 5(1) clarifies that if
                        the contract does not specify that a payment claim must be served by, on or
                        after a specified day of the month, then the default position is that a
                        payment claim must be served “by the last day of the month”
                        (ie, the payment claim can be served on any day of the month).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     With respect, I think the AR’s
                    interpretation of reg 5(1) is unjustified by the language used in the provision.
                    The words “shall be served by the last day of each month following the
                    month in which the contract is made” cannot be read as meaning that no
                    payment claim can be served in the month in which the contract is made. The
                    deadline set by reg 5(1) is the very last day for service but that does not
                    prohibit a contractor from serving earlier if he has done the work in question
                    and there is no contractual provision postponing entitlement to payment. For
                    instance, let us assume there is a school directive for students to submit their
                    assignments by the last day of each month following the month in which the
                    assignment is given and an assignment is given in early January. The deadline
                    for submission would therefore be the last day of February. Surely a diligent
                    student who has completed his work in January is not thereby prevented from
                    submitting his work in January. Asking someone to complete a task <em>by</em> a certain time is not telling him that he is not
                    allowed to complete it earlier.</p>

                    authors in support of the interpretation he contended for. The first was Chow

                    (“Dr Chan’s”) position, the defendant tendered a paper
                    entitled “Statutory adjudication and the standard building contract in
                    Singapore – Is the Final Payment referable to statutory
                    adjudication?”, which was submitted to COBRA 2008 (the construction and
                    building research conference of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
                    held in September 2008). That paper discussed the first case that went up to the
                    High Court challenging the validity of an adjudicator’s determination,
                        <em>Tiong Seng Contractors (Pte) Ltd v Chuan Lim Construction
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 364 (“<em>Tiong
                        Seng Contractors</em>”). In the concluding section at page 11
                    of the paper, Dr Chan raised certain queries that he felt ought to have been
                    raised in respect of that case, the first of which I set out here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>First, as each payment claim has a limitation period to
                            serve</em>, is it possible to validly serve a payment claim based
                        on Progress Claim 10 dated one month after the Final Claim and which
                        represents the unpaid amount claimed in the Final Claim. <em>It is humbly submitted that without further scrutiny of other points, a
                            payment claim based on</em><b><em>more than a month old</em></b><em>Final Claim would have been time
                        barred</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Evidently, Dr Chan took the view that each payment claim must be
                    served within a limitation period and it seems reasonable to conclude from the
                    preceding excerpt that he understood the limitation period to be one month. I
                    should also state that it does not appear from the judgment in <em>Tiong Seng Contractors</em> that the plaintiffs had
                    contractually provided for a limitation period within which payment claims must
                    be served.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Although the wording of reg 5(1) is admittedly
                    not free from ambiguity, it seems to me that Mr Chow’s and Dr
                    Chan’s understanding of the said provision is pragmatic and sensible and I
                    agree with them.</p>

                            specified by the Superintending Officer following the month in which the

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The default position of requiring payment
                    claims to be made at monthly intervals is a sensible arrangement allowing a
                    potential respondent under the Act to be regularly informed of sums due under a
                    construction contract. With this background understanding of the default
                    requirement of payment claims to be made at monthly intervals, the text in reg
                    5(1) requiring that a payment claim (under a contract which does not specify
                    when a payment claim shall be served) must be served by the last day of each
                    month makes sense. Therefore, reg 5(1) means that, following the month in which
                    the contract is made, payment claims must be served at monthly intervals by the
                    last day of each month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On this understanding, it follows that payment
                    claims for work done in a certain month must be served by the last day of the
                    subsequent month. Thus, for example, for work done in April, payment must be
                    claimed by 31 May. To require payment for work done in a certain month to be
                    claimed by the last day of the same month, e.g. payment for work done on 29 or
                    30 April to be claimed by 30 April, may be much too onerous for the
                    claimant. On the other hand, if payment for work done in a certain month is not
                    claimed under the SOPA by the last day of the subsequent month, then a claim in
                    respect thereof cannot be made under the SOPA anymore <em>ie</em> any later claim would fail under the SOPA for being outside
                    the limitation period prescribed in reg 5(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Taking the AR’s interpretation, there
                    would be no limitation period under the SOPA or the SOPR within which payment
                    claims must be served. The AR took the view (at [28] of the AR’s decision) that his interpretation was to
                    be preferred because the SOPA was purposed “to provide persons who have
                    performed construction work with a statutory entitlement to a progress
                    payment.” In my view, the SOPA was meant to expedite payments to
                    claimants so as to facilitate their cash flow and relieve their financial
                    problems and to provide an expeditious adjudication process to resolve
                    construction disputes in the interim (see [10] and [12] of
                        <em>Sungdo Engineering</em>) and having a limitation
                    period of almost two months is entirely consistent with that purpose. If a
                    contractor is facing cash flow difficulties, I have no doubt that he would be
                    diligent in making monthly payment claims well within that limitation period. In
                    any event, even if he does not do so within the limitation period, that does not
                    mean he will be left without any remedy. He can still pursue his claims by
                    arbitration or by litigation (as the plaintiff has now done). I note that
                    section 13(4) of the NSW Act contains a longer limitation period of 12 months
                    for payment claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is also important to remember that once a
                    valid payment claim under the SOPA is served, a process with strict timelines
                    applies to the respondent. As Mr Chow noted in <em>Security
                        of Payments and Construction Adjudication</em> (at page 541):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Potential for Ambush</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Timing of claim</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Once the claim is presented, the respondent has only the prescribed
                        maximum of 21 days [see s 11(1)(a) of the SOPA; if not contractually
                        provided for, the respondent has only seven days under s 11(1)(b) of the
                        SOPA] to provide a payment response. This is only adequate if the claim is
                        relatively straight forward. In complex cases, even allowing for the fact
                        that a high degree of exactitude is not normally expected of progress
                        payment valuations, the timeline will be extremely demanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The role of section 10(4) of the SOPA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Finally, I will address section 10(4) of the
                    SOPA, which I set out below together with section 10(1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Payment claims</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>10</b>.—(1) A claimant may serve one
                        payment claim in respect of a progress payment on —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) one or more other persons who, under the contract concerned,
                        is or may be liable to make the payment; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) such other person as specified in or identified in
                        accordance with the terms of the contract for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Nothing in subsection (1) shall prevent the claimant from
                        including, in a payment claim in which a respondent is named, an amount
                        that was the subject of a previous payment claim served in relation to
                        the same contract which has not been paid by the respondent if, and
                        only if, the first-mentioned payment claim is served within 6 years
                        after the construction work to which the amount in the second-mentioned
                        payment claim relates was last carried out, or the goods or services to
                        which the amount in the second-mentioned payment claim relates were
                        last supplied, as the case may be. </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The effect of section 10(4) is that a
                    claimant can only include in a payment claim amounts which were the subject of
                    earlier payment claims. This is also in line with Dr Chan’s view at
                    paragraph 3.2.8 of <em>Statutory Adjudication in
                        Singapore</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Discussion of s 10(4) of the SOPA]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.2.8 <em>Therefore, it would appear that if any
                            claimed amount has not been properly included in a payment claim as
                            prescribed by s 10(2), it is no longer possible to make a claim
                            that is out of time. Thus, the time of service of the payment claim is
                            also the limitation period for the purpose of claiming an amount in a
                            payment claim</em>. According to s 10(2), this limitation
                        period may be agreed by the parties under s 10(2)(a) or it may be
                        prescribed under s 10(2)(b). <b><em>On the other hand,
                            once a claimed amount is properly included in a payment claim that is
                            properly served, it can be incorporated in future payment claim subject
                            to the limitation set out in s 10(4)</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     If a respondent does not pay a claimant or
                    serve a payment response, the claimant could pursue the adjudication process and
                    make an adjudication application but these are the early stages of the contract
                    and chances are that he may not wish to antagonise the respondent. I say
                    “antagonise” because while a valid payment claim may make no
                    reference to the SOPA, the claimant’s notice to the respondent of his
                    intention to apply for adjudication (required by section 13(2) of the SOPA)
                    would surely indicate that the parties are moving into contention mode. However,
                    if the claimant does nothing, he will soon be out of time to make the
                    adjudication application. This is because the claimant has a time limit of seven
                    days within which to make the adjudication application once he is entitled to
                    make it (see section 13(3)(a) of the SOPA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     This is the moment that section 10(4) assists
                    the claimant. Section10(4) allows him to bundle the amount from the earlier
                    payment claim (for which the claimant might have decided not to make an
                    adjudication application) into a subsequent one (subject to the stipulated six
                    year time limit) and then later submit an adjudication application for the total
                    sum claimed. Thus, the claimant’s right to adjudication under the SOPA is
                    preserved even if he decides not to follow through with the adjudication process
                    early on in the construction contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Payment Claim No 6 was served out of time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Applying the legal analysis set out earlier to
                    the facts of this case, work was done by the plaintiff at the latest in April
                    2010. The last day for service of the payment claim for work done in April 2010
                    was 31 May 2010. Since Payment Claim No 6 was served only on 2 June
                    2010, it was served out of time, albeit by only a couple of days. However, the
                    plaintiff retains her usual legal remedies as noted by McDougall J at [217]
                    of <em>Chase Oyster</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... even if the door to adjudication is closed, the door to judgment
                        remains open; and the ability of the respondent to bar access through that
                        door to judgment is limited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Therefore, although I did not interfere with
                    the Adjudicator’s finding that Payment Claim No 6 was a valid payment
                    claim under the SOPA with respect to its form and content, I set aside the
                    Adjudication Determination on the basis that Payment Claim No 6 was served out
                    of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I made the following orders pertaining to
                    costs:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Adjudicator ordered the defendant to pay
                            $7,971.50 costs and the adjudication fee of $535.00. The plaintiff
                            conceded that she should now bear these costs. I ordered these amounts
                            to be paid by the plaintiff.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The AR ordered $3,000 costs against the
                            defendant. As the defendant succeeded on one out of the three issues
                            before the AR, I set aside the AR’s order on costs and awarded
                            $1,000 to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant for the hearing
                            before the AR.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">As for the costs of this appeal, since the
                            defendant succeeded on only one out of the two points canvassed, I
                            awarded $5,500 to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, together
                            with reasonable disbursements.</div>
