Four of the charges related to the first victim (“V1”) and two related to the second victim (“V2”). Both victims were 14 years old at the material time. On account of their age and the nature of the offences, an order was imposed pursuant to s 8(3) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) to prevent the reporting of any information that might lead to their identification. The six charges were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One charge under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code for sexually assaulting V1 by penetration on 29 October 2017 (“the First Charge”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  Two charges under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 375(2) of the Penal Code for raping V1 on 29 October 2017 (“the Second Charge” and “the Third Charge”, respectively); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) One charge under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 375(2) of the Penal Code for raping V1 on 3 November 2017 (“the Fourth Charge”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) One charge under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code for sexually assaulting V2 by penetration on 15 October 2017 (“the Fifth Charge”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) One charge under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 375(2) of the Penal Code for raping V2 on 15 October 2017 (“the Sixth Charge”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary issue: whether the accused was fit to plead</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Before addressing the substantive issues in this case, it is apposite for me to highlight various pertinent events throughout the court proceedings. These pertained to the accused’s conduct in court during August and September 2019, on the initial dates scheduled for the hearing, as well as from 14 January 2020 when the trial proper commenced up to 20 January 2020 when I decided to call upon the accused to enter his defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The events in August and September 2019 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The accused’s trial was originally scheduled to commence on 1 August 2019 and conclude on 20 August 2019. However, the accused behaved erratically when he first appeared in court on 1 August 2019. When invited to state his plea after the charges were read to him and when queries were addressed to him, he gave stock responses and repeatedly muttered (in English), “I don’t know”, “I can’t remember”, “My mother asked me to go back home” and “This is not my place”.

However, he did not behave in a similar fashion at any prior court attendances. I enquired verbally from the Prison warders escorting the accused whether they had observed the accused exhibiting any unusual behaviour in the Prisons van. They informed me that he had appeared normal in the van and had remained quiet throughout the journey from the remand prison to the courthouse.

I was not in a position then to decide if he was indeed malingering or whether there were genuine issues with his mental health. On the Prosecution’s application pursuant to s 247(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), I ordered that the accused be remanded at IMH in order to ascertain his fitness to plead. The original trial dates were vacated and the accused was subsequently remanded at IMH for five weeks from 8 August to 4 September 2019 for observation and assessment.

</div> Apparently, he had also touched the faeces on his trousers and then rubbed his soiled hands on his shirt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 All this resulted in some delay in the commencement of the trial. When the trial eventually commenced at 11.11am, the accused was present in the courtroom in his soiled prison attire. I began by reminding him of the contents of the 3 September IMH report. After the charges were read to the accused, he again did not give a plea. A refusal to enter a plea meant that he would be deemed to be claiming trial, and thus the Prosecution proceeded to call its witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 During the first day of hearing, the accused did not speak throughout the time he was in the courtroom. He was unresponsive and uncommunicative, and did not cross-examine any of the Prosecution’s witnesses. For no apparent reason whatsoever, about an hour after the trial had commenced, he smeared his faeces on the glass panel surrounding the dock while the first Prosecution witness was giving his evidence.

These were all clearly volitional acts for which he had no reasonable excuse. Having regard to the 3 September IMH report and the evidence of the Prisons doctors, I found that he was again malingering and being deliberately uncooperative and obstructive in his conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Furthermore, I disbelieved the accused’s claim that he had just recovered from memory loss. Deputy Superintendent of Police Kwa Beng Hwee (“DSP Kwa”), who was responsible for supervising the accused while he was in remand, testified that the accused had not shown any signs of memory loss from 3 September 2019 to 14 January 2020. Dr Jacob Rajesh, a senior consultant psychiatrist from the Singapore Prison Service who examined the accused during his remand, also testified that the accused had not displayed any signs of memory loss since 3 September 2019.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The accused’s refusal to state if he would enter a defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 After the Prosecution had called its witnesses and closed its case on the fourth day of the hearing (20 January 2020), I ruled that the Prosecution had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case and had adduced evidence, not inherently incredible, which satisfied all the elements of the charges. I therefore proceeded to administer the standard allocution and called upon the accused to enter his defence to the charges. Regrettably, in spite of my numerous attempts to elicit a response, the accused refused to state whether he would or would not enter his defence. Instead, he repeatedly insisted that he needed a lawyer to assist him and maintained that he was not refusing to cooperate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It was implicit from what the accused had said that he was seeking an adjournment so that he could attempt to obtain legal representation. I rejected his request for two reasons. First, the accused was previously represented by lawyers assigned by the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”), who had discharged themselves in November 2018 with his consent. CLAS had also informed the accused that he would not be assigned another CLAS lawyer. Secondly, the accused had been given ample time since then to engage counsel if he wished to do so before the commencement of his trial in January 2020, but he had not done so. As such, I held that the accused had, by his conduct, impliedly elected not to give a defence. I had also made it clear to him that I was entitled to draw appropriate inferences, including adverse ones, from his decision to remain silent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 After the Prosecution had made its closing submissions on 23 January 2020, pursuant to the accused’s request, I allowed him an adjournment to peruse the transcripts of the hearing and prepare his written closing submissions. As set out in s 230(1)(<span class="font-italic">u</span>) of the CPC, the accused is permitted to sum up his case at the close of the Defence’s case. It has been suggested that this subsection is flexible enough to allow an accused person who had elected not to give evidence to nonetheless have an opportunity to sum up his case: see <span class="font-italic">The Criminal </span><span class="font-italic">Procedure Code of Singapore: Annotations and Commentary</span> (Jennifer Marie &amp; Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir eds) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at 12.063. I agreed that this was a fair and sensible course to adopt.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The accused’s written submissions were duly prepared and tendered in advance of the adjourned hearing date on 5 February 2020. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The accused’s defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As noted above, the accused did not formally elect to give a defence. The consequence was that there was no evidence put forward by the accused in rebuttal of the Prosecution’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Nevertheless, I was able to glean the accused’s case from some of the questions which he posed in cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses, as well as his closing submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I understood the accused’s defence to consist of essentially two limbs. First, the accused alleged that both victims had consented to the sexual acts which had been committed against them. In particular, he denied threatening or coercing them at any point in time, and argued that they had voluntarily and willingly followed him home.

</div> I therefore found that V2’s evidence had a high degree of internal consistency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Furthermore, V2’s evidence was externally consistent with the extrinsic evidence tendered by the Prosecution. The Whatsapp communications between V2 and the accused which were retrieved from the accused’s handphone corroborated V2’s evidence that she had not known the accused personally before he contacted her via Whatsapp, and that the accused had offered her a cleaning job at his house for three days.

Immediately after the incident, she confided in her friends, including PW15 and PW16, about what the accused had done. She was observed to be in a distressed state. If the incident had been wholly consensual, it defies logic for V1 to have complained of it and/or to have reacted the way she did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 With respect to the second incident (on 3 November 2017), I accepted V1’s explanation that she only followed the accused to his motorcycle because she wrongly assumed that he was driving her to a coffeeshop located near PW15’s block. I also agreed that it was reasonable that V1 did not try to escape or call for help because she did not have a handphone or money, and was frightened that the accused would make good his threat to circulate her videos on social media and make them go “viral” if she stopped complying with his demands. Finally, I was of the view that no inferences could be drawn from the fact that V1 seemed to have smiled as she was going up in the lift to the accused’s unit. As the Prosecution pointed out, it is not impossible for a person to smile even when he or she is feeling nervous or afraid.

The accused’s assertion that he had not used any threat or force on V2 before fellating her and having penile-vaginal intercourse with her was completely unsubstantiated. By contrast, V2’s testimony that she was threatened by the accused was corroborated by her despondent demeanour in the videos that the accused had taken of her. She was in a state of fear and helpless resignation. Moreover, in the video clip titled “IMG_1140”, which depicts V2 performing fellatio on the accused, V2 asked the accused “how long more” and told him “I don’t know how to do it”. This further buttressed her evidence that the acts were non-consensual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I was unable to place any weight on the fact that V2 had initiated conversation with the accused by asking him how to use the Bluetooth device which he had given to her.

In addition, there is no general rule which requires all victims of sexual assault to report the offences to the authorities in a timely fashion (see <span class="font-italic">Roger Yue </span>at [30]); <span class="font-italic">DT v Public Prosecutor </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 583 at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It would appear that the accused had blithely capitalised on the victims’ youthful innocence and naïveté by employing various devious means to gain their trust while playing on their fears and insecurities. One illustration can be seen from how he would buy food for both victims to eat in his flat before proceeding to bring them into his bedroom where he would sexually assault them. Another illustration is the manner in which the accused persuaded V1 to accompany him up to his flat on 2 November 2017, ostensibly so that he could leave his motorcycle helmet there. Although V1 was initially reluctant, he persuaded her to follow him by saying that they would simply head back downstairs for drinks and conversation. He made good on this assurance and presumably was able to regain some of her confidence and trust as a result. By the time they had drinks and ended their conversation at the void deck, he wanted to bring her up to his flat again – except that this time, he resorted to threatening to beat her up if she were to refuse. Consequently, V1 felt compelled to follow him out of fear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In addition, by giving the victims money or other items and sending them home on his motorcycle, the accused was again playing mind games with them. In my assessment, these actions were intended to show that he had not forced himself upon them and was, in his own words as put to V1, a “good person”.

</div> In all likelihood, they were no more than mere manipulative devices designed to confuse the victims into thinking that they were willing parties all along, or to be used (as was evidently done in his trial) to back up his own defence of consent should a subsequent complaint be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Ultimately, it had to be borne in mind that both victims were young, vulnerable and impressionable, being merely 14 years of age at the time of the alleged offences. Further, both of the victims were susceptible to manipulation and abuse: V1 was not in possession of a handphone, and neither victim had money with them at the material time. Both apparently came from troubled family backgrounds. It is understandable that they would have felt intimidated, helpless and frightened when threatened by the accused, particularly when he was (to their knowledge) a member of a gang. It is also clear from s 90(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Penal Code that submission which is clouded by fear of injury cannot amount to consent at law. I therefore rejected the accused’s defence of consent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the accused was the victim of a conspiracy or fabrication of evidence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Finally, I considered the second limb of the accused’s defence, which was that he was the victim of a conspiracy by V1 and/or her friends. I also evaluated the accused’s suggestion, in his closing submissions, that V2 had lied and fabricated evidence to implicate him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In my view, these assertions were completely untenable. The accused offered no evidence to support his theory, choosing neither to testify nor to call any other witnesses in support of his defence. He did not even cross-examine V2, leaving her evidence unchallenged. I saw no plausible reason why either V1 or V2 and/or V1’s friends would have fabricated evidence against him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The other allegations the accused made, some of which I had referred to earlier (see [54] above), were of no assistance to him as they did not affect the cogency of the Prosecution’s evidence. In my judgment, V1, V2, PW15 and PW16 were all consistent and credible witnesses, and I did not see any material discrepancies in the accounts which they had put forth before this court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 For the above reasons, I found that the Prosecution had proven all the elements of the proceeded charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted him on four charges of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 375(2) of the Penal Code, and two charges of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prosecution’s submissions on sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Prosecution contended that the dominant sentencing considerations in this case were that of deterrence and retribution. The principle of general deterrence featured in this case because the accused’s offences were committed against young and vulnerable victims. The principle of specific deterrence was also relevant because the accused was traced for related offences.

According to the Prosecution, the accused’s offences fell within the mid-region of Band 2 of both the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>frameworks, which translated into a sentence of at least 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each of the accused’s rape charges, and at least 12 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for each of the accused’s sexual assault by penetration charges. The Prosecution therefore urged this court to impose a global sentence of at least 30 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane in this case.

I was of the view that specific deterrence was particularly important given that the accused had previous related antecedents with unfortunate parallels to the present case. In 2008, the accused was convicted on four charges of carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code, and three charges of having unlawful carnal connection with a girl below the age of 16 years except by marriage under s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed). The charges related to four separate victims, three of whom were under the age of 16.

</div> The accused’s <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> for these offences bore substantial similarities with the present case. In each set of offences, the accused reached out to young girls and used various pretexts to bring them to a location where he could commit sexual acts against them. Furthermore, the accused almost always used his mobile phone to take photographs and/or videos of these sexual acts.

</div>
</div> I was therefore mindful that the accused’s sentence had to be severe enough to deter him from perpetrating offences of a similar nature in the future. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable sentencing frameworks </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I now turn to consider the relevant sentencing frameworks in this case. In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the Court of Appeal set out a two-stage sentencing framework for rape offences, which it summarised thus (at [73]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) At the first step, the court should have regard to the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific </span>factors in deciding which band the offence in question falls under. Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may <span class="font-italic">usually</span> be imposed for an offence with those features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an ‘indicative starting point’. In exceptional cases, the court may decide on an indicative starting point which falls outside the prescribed range, although cogent reasons should be given for such a decision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The sentencing bands prescribe ranges of sentences which would be appropriate for contested cases and are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Band 1 comprises cases at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness which attract sentences of 10–13 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Such cases feature no offence-specific aggravating factors or are cases where these factors are only present to a very limited extent and therefore have a limited impact on sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Band 2 comprises cases of rape of a higher level of seriousness which attract sentences of 13–17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Such cases would usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors (such as those listed at [44] above). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) Band 3 comprises cases which, by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors, present themselves as extremely serious cases of rape. They should attract sentences of between 17–20 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are <span class="font-italic">personal to the offender</span> to calibrate the sentence. These are factors which relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be the same factors which have already been taken into account in determining the categorisation of the offence. One of the factors which the court should consider at this stage is the value of a plea of guilt (if any). The mitigating value of a plea of guilt should be assessed in terms of (i) the extent to which it is a signal of remorse; (ii) the savings in judicial resources; and (iii) the extent to which it spared the victim the ordeal of testifying. Thus under our proposed framework, while for the first step an uncontested case will proceed in the same way as a contested case, it is at the second step that the appropriate discount will be accorded by the court for the plea of guilt by the offender. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The court should clearly articulate the factors it has taken into consideration as well as the weight which it is placing on them. This applies <span class="font-italic">both</span> at the second step of the analysis, when the court is calibrating the sentence from the indicative starting point <span class="font-italic">and</span> at the end of the sentencing process, when the court adjusts the sentence on account of the totality principle. In this regard, we would add one further caveat. In a case where the offender faces two or more charges, and the court is required to order one or more sentences to run consecutively, the court can, if it thinks it necessary, further calibrate the individual sentence to ensure that the global sentence is appropriate and not excessive. When it does so, the court should explain itself so that the individual sentence imposed will not be misunderstood. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, the Court of Appeal transposed the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>framework to the offence of digital penetration. However, the range of starting sentences for each band was calibrated downwards to reflect the lesser gravity of the offence. It was held (at [159]) that the appropriate sentencing bands for a digital penetration offence was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Band 1: seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)  Band 2: ten to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Band 3: 15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Although <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>specifically concerned digital-vaginal penetration, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BPH v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 2 SLR 764 (“<span class="font-italic">BPH</span>”) subsequently clarified (at [55]) that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework was applicable to all forms of sexual assault by penetration, including the penetration of a female victim’s mouth by a male accused’s penis under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Given that the offence-specific and offender-specific factors outlined in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>apply equally to the offences of rape and sexual assault by penetration (see <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [158]; <span class="font-italic">PP v BRH </span>[2020] SGHC 14 at [33]), I analysed the applicable factors for both types of offences concurrently. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">First stage: Offence-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I agreed with the Prosecution that there were a number of offence-specific aggravating factors in this case.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Vulnerability of the victims:</span> Both V1 and V2 were only fourteen years of age at the time of the accused’s offences. Furthermore, V1 did not own a handphone, and both V1 and V2 were in need of money. V1 did not live with her own family and V2 had run away from home at the material time. The accused intentionally capitalised on these circumstances to lure the victims into his flat.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Premeditation:</span> The accused’s offences demonstrated a high level of premeditation. Apart from targeting the victims and devising spurious reasons to bring them to his flat, the accused also manipulated and intimidated them and repeatedly used specific threats to compel them to comply with his sexual demands.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">Threat of harm:</span> The accused threatened both victims that he would call his friends to sexually assault them if they did not perform the sexual acts demanded of them. He also threatened to harm V1’s reputation by circulating videos of her sexual acts on social media. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">Recording of sexual acts on mobile phone: </span>The accused used his mobile phone to record the sexual acts which he had perpetrated on the victims. This intensified the victims’ distress as they were forced to live with the knowledge that the sensitive footages in the accused’s mobile phone could be exposed to a wider audience without their consent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-italic">Failure to use condom:</span> Finally, the accused failed to use a condom when he engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse with both victims. This created a risk of pregnancy and/or the transmission of sexually-transmitted diseases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Thus, I was satisfied that this was a case which fell squarely within Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>frameworks. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second stage: Offender-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I also found that there were offender-specific aggravating factors which were relevant to the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>frameworks. Specifically, the accused’s previous convictions clearly demonstrated his proclivity towards committing sexual offences against minors. Moreover, the accused displayed an astonishing lack of remorse for his actions. He did not spare the victims from having to give evidence in court and reliving the trauma of their respective ordeals. His lack of remorse was also evident from his mitigation plea where he continued to maintain his innocence, as well as his egregious conduct during the court proceedings, including his wilful refusal to change out of his soiled clothes and his act of smearing faeces on the glass panel surrounding the dock. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In my judgment, the accused had exhibited “wholly-exceptional contempt” for the court proceedings, which could in ordinary circumstances be validly regarded as an aggravating factor (see <span class="font-italic">Zeng </span><span class="font-italic">Guoyuan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 556 at [37]). However, while I formed this view of the accused’s conduct, I remained conscious that he would in all likelihood be made to face additional charges in respect of his conduct on 1 August 2019 and 14 January 2020. With this in mind, I did not accord any weight to his conduct as a stand-alone aggravating factor to justify imposing a heavier sentence. As the Prosecution made clear, the purpose of referring to the accused’s contemptuous conduct in its submissions was because such conduct could be validly taken into account in showing his utter lack of remorse.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 There were no relevant mitigating factors in the present case. It is well-established that hardship caused to the accused’s family as a result of his punishment is of little mitigatory value except in exceptional circumstances (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Sum </span>[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022 at [31]). I was of the view that the circumstances of this case were not exceptional. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I agreed that the Prosecution had correctly identified the accused’s offences as falling within the mid-region of Band 2 of both the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>frameworks. I further accepted that it would be appropriate to consider a sentence of at least 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each of the accused’s rape charges, and at least 12 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane for each of the accused’s sexual assault by penetration charges. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the global sentence ought to be at least 30 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
