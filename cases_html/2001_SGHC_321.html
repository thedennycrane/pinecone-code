charge was stood down and the prosecution proceeded on the first charge.<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>2.    Under the first charge (‘the Charge’), the

accused was charged with the offence of importing into Singapore a controlled drug,

specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185, on or

about 1 March 2001 at about 6.15am by having 31 packets of granular substance containing

not less than 610.15g of diamorphine in a motor car bearing registration number JFY 6358

(‘the Car’) at Customs Examination Bay Green Channel Lane R2, Woodlands

Checkpoint, Singapore.<i xmlns=""><b>

prosecution proceeded to prove its case.

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><em><strong><br/>

The Prosecution’s Case</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">4.    On 1 March 2001 at about 6.15am, PW7 Chief Custom Officer

(‘CCO’) Zainal Abiden Bin Atan stopped the Car driven by the accused while on

duty at Customs Examinations Bay Green Channel Lane R2, Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore.

It was a red coloured Proton Wira.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.    Upon inspection of the boot of the Car, he noticed that the

speaker box was unusually big.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    After a while, he noticed a hole on one side of the speaker. He

put his finger into the hole and felt some plastic inside. He asked the accused what was

inside the speaker box but the accused kept quiet. He then called PW10 Higher Customs

Officer (‘HCO’) Gopalan Nelakandan for assistance.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    As HCO Gopalan was approaching the Car, he shouted something. The

accused was running away from the Car.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    Customs Officer (‘CO’) Shahriman Bin Daud gave chase

while HCO Gopalan ran towards a Police Post to seek assistance.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    CCO Abiden remained behind to guard the Car.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.    At about 6.45am both HCO Gopalan and CO Shahriman returned. They

had not been able to catch the accused.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.    Various packets of substance were found in the speaker box. Some

were the subject of the Charge.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    Further searches for the accused were conducted.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.    The accused was subsequently found at about 9.35am of the same

day in a manhole in an area of bushes near the exit of the Arrival Lorry Bay (‘the

Manhole’).</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    The accused was injured and was eventually lifted out of the

Manhole with the assistance of the Singapore Civil Defence Force.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.    The accused had entered Singapore using a Malaysian Passport

bearing the name of Leong Chee Yoong and Passport Number A10636256 (Exhibit P80).</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    On the next day, a Malaysian Identity Card 581115-08-5277 and a

Malaysian driving licence were some of the articles recovered from the Manhole where the

accused was found. Both the identity card and driving licence bore the name Leong Chee

Yoong.</p>

<em><strong>Cautioned Statement by accused </strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">17.    In his cautioned statement given on 7 March 2001 between 1444

hours and 1516 hours pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (‘CPC’)

Cap 68 to Assistant Superintendent (‘ASP’) Toh Soon Teck, the accused said,

‘I have nothing to say’. The statement was taken with the assistance of an

interpreter as the accused chose to speak in Hokkien.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    The other statements referred to below were also taken with the

assistance of an interpreter.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>
<em><strong>Second statement from accused</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">19.    ASP Toh recorded another statement from the accused under s 121

of the CPC on 8 March 2001 at about 1435 hours.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    The statement reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘ I am known as "Ah Kiat" to family and my friends.</p>
<p align="justify">2 On 1 March 2001 at about 4 to 5 a.m., I drove my car, JFY 6358, to

  the carpark of Sentosa Shopping Centre, Johor Bahru. I parked the car there and open the

  car boot and walked away. After half an hour later, my handphone, number:012-7603551,

  rang. I answered the call and the male voice spoke to me in Malay to the effect the things

  were inside the car and I could drive off. I drove to a deserted place nearby. I opened

  the car boot and saw a paper box. I opened the paper box and saw three different types of

  wrappings. The first type was newspaper wrapping contained in plastic bags, the second

  type was in polythene wrapping and the third type was wrapped in masking tape.</p>
<p align="justify">3 I then opened the speaker box in the car boot and placed all the

  wrappings into the speaker box. As I placed the wrappings into the speaker box, I counted

  them. There were a total of 22 "liap" of newspaper wrapping in plastic bags, a

  total of 9 "liap" of polythene wrappings and 5 "liap" of masking tape

  wrapping. From the wrappings, I knew that the 22 "liap" and the 9

  "liap" were all containing heroin and the 5 "liap" were containing

  opium. I knew one "liap" of heroin is over 400 grams but I do not know the

  weight of one "liap" of opium.</p>
<p align="justify">4 I took about 10 minutes to put all the wrappings into the speaker

  box. Then I fixed back the speaker box. After that I drove straight to Singapore. On

  arriving Woodlands Checkpoint, I drove my car to the Immigration Counter whereby my

  Malaysian forged passport was stamped. Then I drove into the bay for cars which had

  nothing to declare. At that point, a male Malay officer in blue uniform asked me in Malay

  to stopped my car. He told me to open the car boot and told me to get down of my car to

  follow him to the car boot. I opened the car boot from the driver seat and alighted and

  followed the officer to the car boot. He did a search in the boot and then asked me

  whether the speaker box could be opened. I answered that it could not be opened. He then

  walked to the car and searched the inside of the car. While searching, he asked me whether

  there was anything inside the car and I said no. he found nothing and switched off my car

  engine and went back to the car boot.</p>
<p align="justify">5 The officer did another search in the boot. At this point, another

  officer came to my car boot. He was a male Malay officer in blue uniform. The first

  officer used his hand to fiddle with the speaker box and through a small opening, he

  pulled out a newspaper wrapping contained in a plastic bag. He asked me what was it and I

  replied that I did not know. He then continued to search the speaker box and I immediately

  fled towards the direction of Singapore.’ </p>

Third statement from the accused</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">21.    ASP Toh recorded a third statement from the accused on 9 March

2001 at about 1440 hours. This statement was recorded under s 121 of the CPC.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    The statement reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘The statement recorded on 08.03.2001 @ Paragraph 1 to Paragraph 5

  was read back to me in Hokkien and I affirmed it to be true and correct.</p>
<p align="justify">6 I ran till I reached a slope where I dropped a shoe. I cannot

  remember whether it was right or left shoe. Then I continued to run across a road meant

  for lorries. I knew it was for lorries as I heard sound of lorry engines. After I reached

  the other side of that road, there were some bushes. As I was trying to run across the

  bushes, I slipped into a drain and rolled into a manhole. There were 2 levels inside the

  manhole and I hit the metal railing at the first level and then fell onto the bottom

  level. I felt painful all over my body and I could not move.</p>
<p align="justify">7 At this point, I used my leather belt to tie on the metal railing to

  try and hang myself. The buckle of the belt gave way and the leather belt slipped off. I

  then fell onto the bottom level. After that I took off my shirt and tied to my leather

  belt and try to hang myself again using the same method. I was again unsuccessful as I

  struggled to breathe and the leather belt that was tied to my shirt slipped off again. I

  laid on my back on the bottom of the manhole and sometime later I heard voices outside the

  manhole. I shouted "hello hello" to get the attention from people outside the

  manhole. A while later, a plain cloth officer and a fireman came down. They tied me to a

  stretcher and lifted me out of the manhole. I was then conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital

  in an ambulance. Later I was transferred to Changi General Hospital where I was warded.</p>
<p align="justify">8 I am now shown a black travel bag with the word "Garfield"

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>
<em><strong>Fourth statement from the accused</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">23.    ASP Toh recorded a fourth statement from the accused on 12 March

2001 at about 1425 hours. The statement was recorded under s 121 of the CPC.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    The statement reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘The statement recorded on 09.03.2001 @ Paragraph 6 to Paragraph

  18 was read back to me in Hokkien and I affirmed it to be true and correct.</p>
<p align="justify">19 I am now shown RM 1550 which was recovered from my shirt pocket. The

  money was left over from my mahjong winnings from gambling den in Johor Bahru. This money

  is not from drug dealings.</p>
<p align="justify">20 The Malaysian car JFY 6358 was bought sometime in January 2001. This

  is a brand new Proton Wira and is not a stolen or second hand car. I paid RM 10,000 for

  the downpayment. I cannot remember which finance company I had to pay my installments to.

  I had not paid any installment yet. I had used the identity of Leong Chee Yoong to

  purchase this car. I do not know whether there exists any Leong Chee Yoong in Malaysia or

  not. The RM 10,000 which I used to pay for the down payment was money from my drug

  dealings.</p>
<p align="justify">21 The back set of my car cannot be opened to gain access to the

  special compartment of speaker box where the drugs were hidden. This special compartment

  could only be opened by pressing on two buttons located at the dashboard near the steering

  wheel. This special compartment and the speaker box were installed in Johor Bahru by a car

  accessories shop.</p>
<p align="justify">22 My Malaysian drug supplier, "Jimmy" was introduced by a

  Malaysian friend known to me as "Ah Hor". I do not have their contact numbers.

  Whenever they need to find me, they call me at my Malaysian handphone, 012-7603551. That

  was about 2 months ago. "Jimmy" asked to deliver drugs to Singapore. He would

  pay me RM 800 for one "liap" of heroin and RM 1,200 for one "liap" of

  opium delivered to Singapore. On the day of arrest, I brought in 31 "liap" of

  heroin and 5 "liap" of opium and I would be paid a total of RM 30,800 for that

  trip. I would be paid once I had delivered the drugs in Singapore and returned to Johor

  Bahru. Since January 2001 until the day of arrest, I had delivered more than 10 occasions.

  During those occasions, I had delivered heroin between 10 over "liap" and 20

  over "liap" and on 3 or 4 occasions, I also delivered 4 to 5 "liap" of

  opium together with the heroin. "Jimmy" would call me at my handphone to tell me

  to collect the drugs from a carpark at Taman Sentosa Shopping Centre and then to deliver

  to Singapore at various places arranged by him.</p>
<p align="justify">23 On the day of my arrest, I was supposed to drive to Ang Mo Kio

  Central carpark and wait for one unknown male Chinese to come to my car to pick up all the

  drugs. My supplier had already told that person my car number and he would then wait for

  me at the carpark. I would merely passed over the drugs to the person and not collect any

  money from him. Someone else would collect money from him. I do not have his contact

  number. Then I would return straight to Johor Bahru using the Woodlands Checkpoint.

  Normally the following day I would receive my payments from "Jimmy".</p>
<p align="justify">24 In the black travel bag with the word "Garfield", beside

  the 9 "liap" of heroin, there was also a digital weighing scale which was

  together with the heroin that I collected earlier. It was meant to be passed to the

  unknown male Chinese in Ang Mo Kio Central carpark. I do not remember placing any glove

  inside the travel bag.</p>
<p align="justify">25 I am now informed that my urine was tested positive for Ecstasy. I

  provided 4 bottles of urine for testing during my stay in Changi General Hospital. I admit

  consuming Ecstasy while I was in Johor Bahru. The last occasion was at "Tian

  Huang" nightclub in Johor Bahru two days before my arrest.</p>
<p align="justify">26 I made about RM 150,000 for all the previous drug deliveries to

  Singapore. I lost all the money on gambling as well as spending at nightclubs in Johor

  Bahru.</p>
<p align="justify">27 I was born in a family with 2 elder sisters and 4 younger sisters.

  They are not involved in any criminal or drug activities. I studied at Li Hua Primary

  school at Yio Chu Kang Road. I studied till Primary 5 and left school as I had no interest

  in studies. I then worked in a timber factory located at Defu Lane for about a year. Then

  I worked as a contract painter. After that I only worked as odd job laborer till now. I

  only worked when there is work available. The rest of the time I spent in gambling on

  horse and soccer. In 1974 I was arrested for secret society activities. I was involved in

  the SS group "Ling Hai San". This SS group is not (sic) longer active. I then

  reported for Police Supervision at Paya Laber Police Station for 3 years. My other

  criminal records include armed robbery and gambling offences. I was placed under probation

  for one year in 1978. After which I did not commit any more offence and I continue to work

  as an odd job laborer. I did not serve my N.S. due to my secret society background.’</p>
