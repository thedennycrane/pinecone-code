<strong>Judgment

</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<b xmlns=""><i><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">BACKGROUND</font>
<p></p></i></b><font size="3" xmlns="">1.        This was an

application by three individuals Ong Pang Wee, Kang Yoke Ping and Ong Oon Teck

(collectively referred to as ‘the Purchasers’) to transfer an action filed by

the Respondent Chiltern Park Development Pte Ltd (‘the Developer’) on the

Magistrate’s Courts as MC Suit No 14303 of 2000/Y.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">2.        The Purchasers had bought a

property known as Block 135 Serangoon Avenue 3 #02-06 Chiltern Park Singapore (‘the

Property’) from the Developer.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">3.        In the MC suit, the

Developer was claiming $13,443.47 from the Purchasers being maintenance fees allegedly

owing for the period April 1996 to June 1999 (including GST and interest).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">4.        In turn, the Purchasers

counterclaimed against the Developer for defects in the Property and loss of use or loss

of rent.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">5.        The Purchasers say the

estimated cost of rectification works was $80,000.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">6.        As for loss of rent, the

keys to the Property were obtained in late May 1995 but due to the defects, the Purchasers

say they have not been able to make use or let the Property out. They were counterclaiming

the loss of use or loss of rent from June 1995 to April 2002 and this loss was continuing.

They asserted that the market rent for the Property would be between $3,300 to $4,000 a

month.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">7.        Their position was that the

quantum of their counterclaim aggregated $353,900 and would come under the jurisdiction of

the High Court, hence, their application.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">8.        At this stage, I would say

that the High Court has jurisdiction even if the aggregate of the counterclaim is $35,000

only. The point is not so much that the High Court has jurisdiction over the counterclaim,

but rather that the aggregate of the counterclaim exceeds the jurisdiction of the

Magistrate’s Court, as well as the District Court, and hence the application.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">9.        I would also add that the

first prayer of the application sought an order that the MC suit be transferred from the

Subordinate Courts to the High Court forthwith. Where there is a claim and a counterclaim,

the prayer should make it clear that both the claim and counterclaim in the named action

are to be transferred.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">ARGUMENTS</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">10.        Mr Tan Yeow Hiang, Counsel

for the Developer, submitted that the High Court had no jurisdiction to order the

transfer. He referred to various provisions in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap

322) and in the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321).</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322)</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">11.        Section 18(1) to (3)

states:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">           

‘<b>Powers of High Court</b></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">18.(1)     The High Court shall have

    such powers as are vested in it by any written law for the time being in force in

    Singapore.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">     (2)    

    Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall have the

    powers set out in the First Schedule.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">     (3)     The

    powers referred to in subsection (2) shall be exercised in accordance with any written law

    or Rules of Court relating to them.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">12.        Clause 10 of the First

Schedule to the SCJA states:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">             

‘<b>Transfer of proceedings</b></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">10.    Power to transfer any proceedings

    to any other court or to or from any subordinate court, and in the case of transfer to or

    from a subordinate court to give any directions as to the further conduct thereof, except

    that this power shall be exercised in such manner as may be prescribed by Rules of

    Court.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">13.        Mr Tan stressed that the

power mentioned in Clause 10 was to be exercised ‘in accordance with any written law

or Rules of Court relating to [it]’ and the relevant written law was the Subordinate

Courts Act (Cap 321).</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321)</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">14.        Mr Tan submitted that

there are three relevant sections in the Subordinate Courts Act relating to the transfer

of an action to the High Court i.e sections 24, 38 and 41.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">15.        The relevant provision in

s 24 is s 24(1). It states:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">             

‘<b>Transfer of counterclaim from District Court to High Cour</b></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">24.(1)     Where, in an action

    founded on contract or tort in a District Court, any counterclaim or set-off and

      counterclaim of any defendant involves a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the

    District Court, any party to the action may apply to the High Court, within such time as

    may be prescribed by Rules of Court, for an order that the whole proceedings, or the

    proceedings on the counterclaim or set-off and counterclaim, be transferred to the High

    Court.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">16.        Section 38 states:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">             

‘<b>General power to transfer from District Court to High Court</b></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">38.    Where it is made to appear to the

    High Court, on the application of a party to any civil proceeding pending in a District

    Court, that the proceeding by reason of its involving some important question of law, or

    being a test case, or for any other sufficient reason, is one which should be tried in the

    High Court, it may order the record to be transferred to the High Court.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">17.       The relevant provision in s 41

is s 41(1) which states:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">           

‘<b>Allocation of proceeding to High Court</b></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">41.(1)     The Chief Justice may,

    where he considers it necessary or expedient to improve efficiency in the administration

    of justice and to provide for more speedy disposal of proceedings commenced in the

    District Courts, by order direct such class or classes or description of proceedings as

    may be specified in the order to be heard and determined by the High Court.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">18.        Mr Tan submitted that all

these three provisions show that the transfer of proceedings to the High Court is of

proceedings in the District Court. There is no mention of a transfer of proceedings in the

Magistrate’s Court to the High Court. Applying the expressio unius est exclusio

alterius rule for statutory interpretation, he submitted that Parliament did not intend to

allow an application to be made to transfer a claim/counterclaim from the

Magistrate’s Court to the High Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">19.        He also referred to s 53

of the Subordinate Courts Act which states:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">             

‘<b>Transfer from Magistrate’s Courts to District Courts</b></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">53. A Magistrate’s Court may, either of its own

    motion or on the application of a party to an action, transfer the action to a District

    Court on the ground that some important question of law or fact is likely to arise.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">20.        His point was that s 53

reinforced his submission because it provided for a transfer from the Magistrate’s

Court only to the District Court, and even then, only on the ground ‘that some

important question of law or fact is likely to arise’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">21.        For the Purchasers, Mr Loh

Kim Kee submitted that Clause 10 (of the First Schedule to the SCJA) did not restrict the

court from which a transfer could be made by the High Court. The power therein was to

transfer to or from ‘any subordinate court’ and not just to or from a District

Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">22.        He also relied on O 89 r

2(1) of the Rules of Court which states:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">             

‘<b>Procedure on transfer from the Subordinate Courts (O.89, r.2)</b></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">2. (1)     Where an order is made by

    the High Court for the transfer of any proceedings from the Subordinate Courts to the High

    Court, the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts must send to the Registrar of the Supreme

    Court the file of the proceedings, all documents, exhibits and a certified copy of the

    notes of evidence (if any) of the proceedings.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">23.        This provision also did

not state that the transfer from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court was restricted

to a transfer from the District Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">24.        Mr Tan countered Mr

Loh’s reliance on O 89 r 2(1) by referring to O 89 r 1(1) which states:</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">             

‘<b>Time for making application under sections 24,37 and 39 (O.89, r.1)</b></font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">1.(1)    Any application to the High

    Court under sections 24, 37 and 39 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Chapter 321) must be

    made by originating summons in Form 7.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">25.        I should add that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a)    the reference to s 39 of the

    Subordinate Courts Act is probably incorrect as s 39 does not deal with the transfer of

    proceedings. The reference should probably be to s 38 instead,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b)    the heading for O 89 r 1(1) is

    inappropriate as the substance thereof does not deal with the time for making an

       application.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">26.        Mr Tan’s point was

that O 89 r 1(1) envisaged the transfer of proceedings only under the provisions

identified therein and those provisions did not specify a transfer from the

Magistrate’s Court to the High Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">27.        According to Mr Tan and Mr

Loh, the Parliamentary Reports did not assist in the interpretation of the SCJA or the

Subordinate Courts Act.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">MY DECISION</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">28.        I was of the view that

Clause 10 of the First Schedule to the SCJA must be read subject to s 18(3) which

specifically provides that the powers referred to in s 18(2), which in turn refers to the

First Schedule, ‘shall be exercised in accordance with any written law or Rules of

Court relating to them’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">29.        This is consistent with s

18(1) which provides that the ‘High Court shall have such powers as are vested in it

by any written law …’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">30.        The written law that was

relevant for the purpose of the application before me was the Subordinate Courts Act.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">31.        I was of the view that Mr

Tan was correct in his submission that the scheme under that Act envisaged a transfer of

proceedings from only the District Court to the High Court and not from the

Magistrate’s Court to the High Court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">32.        As regards the Rules of

Court, O 89 r 1(1) did not specifically say that a transfer from a subordinate court to

the High Court is restricted to proceedings in a District Court. It was specifying only

the form to be used in an application for transfer under the three sections named therein.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">33.        However, I was of the view

that the reference to only the three sections mentioned therein which in turn refer to a

transfer from the District Court to the High Court (ss 24 and 38) or from the High Court

to the District Court (s 37), reinforced the scheme I have mentioned under the Subordinate

Courts Act.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">34.        Furthermore, although rule

2(1) refers generally to the transfer of ‘any proceedings from the Subordinate Courts

to the High Court’, it should be interpreted in a manner consistent with, and not

contrary to, the scheme under the Subordinate Courts Act.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">35.        In my view, there is no

inconsistency between O 89 r 2(1) with that scheme. In any event, subsidiary legislation

cannot over-ride primary legislation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">36.        Mr Loh brought up another

point. He said that if the Purchasers had to file a fresh suit in the High Court, and

withdraw the counterclaim in the MC suit, they may be caught by a time-bar, in so far as

the earlier period in respect of their claim was concerned. In my view, the

Purchasers’ claim should not have been filed as a counterclaim in the MC suit in the

first place. I should add that Mr Loh was unable to say why this had been done as his firm

was not acting for the Purchasers at the relevant time.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">37.        As for the question as to

what should be done with regard to the Developer’s claim, it was up to the Developer

to decide whether to proceed with it or withdraw it and file the claim as a counterclaim

in the High Court suit to be filed by the Purchasers so that both claims could be dealt

with together. While this was far from ideal, it was the result of the scheme of things

prevailing.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">38.        It may well be that there

should be some law reform to address the situation which has arisen so that, in future, a

party in the High Court can apply to have proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court

transferred to the High Court, if the circumstances warrant such an order. Likewise, for

the transfer of proceedings from the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court which

is at present limited to an important question of law or fact. However, the question of

law reform is a separate matter.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">39.        In the circumstances, I

dismissed the application with costs.</font></p>
