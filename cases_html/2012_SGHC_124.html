<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against a
                    custodial sentence imposed for the offence under
                        s 13(2)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    National Registration Act (Cap 201, 1992 Rev Ed)
                    (“the NRA”) of using an identity card
                    (“I/C”) other than one’s own without
                    lawful authority or reasonable excuse (referred to hereafter
                    as the “s 13(2)(<em>b</em>)
                    NRA offence” for short). At the conclusion of the
                    hearing of the appeal, I set aside the custodial sentence
                    and substituted a fine of $3,000 on the grounds that the
                    sentence of imprisonment was wrong in principle,
                    inappropriate and manifestly excessive. I now give the
                    detailed reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant was the
                    subject of a self-exclusion order applied for on his behalf
                    by his son on 21 September 2010 as a result of his
                        (<em>ie</em>, the
                    appellant’s) own fear that he would be unable to
                    resist the temptation of gambling in a casino. About a year
                    later, on 4 September 2011 at around 1.55am, the
                    appellant was caught attempting to use his wife’s I/C
                    to enter the casino at Resorts World Sentosa. His wife had
                    paid the $100 levy (applicable to Singapore citizens and
                    Singapore permanent residents) to enter the casino and had
                    gone out to use the toilet. Before doing so, she had
                    (according to the Statement of Facts) handed her I/C to the
                    appellant for safekeeping. The appellant decided to enter
                    the casino with his wife’s I/C, but encountered
                    difficulties in scanning her I/C at the casino’s
                    gantry. A casino security officer went to assist him and
                    discovered his unlawful act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant was charged
                    with two offences in the District Court. He pleaded guilty
                    to the two charges, and the district judge (“the
                    DJ”) sentenced him to two months’ imprisonment
                    for the first charge and a fine of $800 (with one
                    week’s imprisonment in default) for the second charge.
                    The charges were for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     a
                            s 13(2)(<em>b</em>) NRA
                        offence, specifically, making use of his wife’s
                        I/C without lawful authority (this was the first
                        charge); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     the offence (applicable only to
                        Singapore citizens and Singapore permanent residents)
                        under s 116(6) of the Casino Control Act
                        (Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the
                        CCA”) read with s 511 of the Penal Code
                        (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) of attempting to enter
                        a casino without paying the levy of $100 (this was the
                        second charge).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The appellant appealed
                    against the sentence imposed for the first charge. In giving
                    his reasons for sentencing the appellant to imprisonment for
                    this charge, the DJ said (see <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Xu </em><em>Zhaohe</em> [2012] SGDC 60 (“the
                    GD”) at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The possession of another person’s [I/C] for an
                        unlawful purpose is a serious offence. The gravity is
                        clearly expressed in the case of PP v Tan Woon Kheng
                        [2006] SGDC 184 where the court stated that
                        “the [I/C] is a form of valuable security and is
                        a highly prized item. Its value to criminal syndicates
                        is immense. It confers rights and liabilities on the
                        bearer. A person can use it to effect various
                        transactions, such as to borrow money, to purchase
                        goods, and the like on the basis that he is the person
                        represented in the [I/C] and he is traceable.
                        Proliferation of such illegal activities involving the
                        use of [I/Cs] would cast a long shadow over the
                        integrity of the entire [I/C] system.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, the DJ’s reliance on what was
                    held in <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Woon
                        Kheng</em> [2006] SGDC 184
                        (“<em>Tan Woon
                    Kheng</em>”) was entirely out of context in the
                    present case: the appellant was not a member of any criminal
                    syndicate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At [15] of the GD, the DJ
                    referred to the facts and the manner in which the appellant
                    had committed the offence, as well as the rationale for the
                    $100 levy imposed under s 116 of the CCA on Singapore
                    citizens and Singapore permanent residents entering a
                    casino, <em>ie</em>, “to signal
                    that gambling is an expense and not a means to make a
                    living, and to discourage casual and impulse
                    gambling” (see <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (22 November 2011) vol 88 <em>per</em> MG (NS) Chan Chun Sing, Acting
                    Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports). The
                    DJ then said (at [16] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The facts in the present case would call for a
                        deterrent sentence. The [appellant] was in fact served
                        with a self-exclusion order by the National Council on
                        Problem Gambling on the 21/9/2010. Notwithstanding the
                        exclusion order, the [appellant] had attempted to use
                        his wife’s [I/C] to gain entry into the
                        casino.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       With respect, I was unable
                    to see why the facts of the present case called for a
                    deterrent sentence. On the contrary, I thought this was the
                    sort of case where a judge should have some understanding of
                    the nature of the offence committed by the appellant and why
                    he committed it. Granted, the appellant’s offence had
                    to do with the use of another person’s I/C without
                    lawful authority, which criminal act, the DJ held, would
                    “cast a long shadow over the integrity of the entire
                    [I/C] system” (see the GD at [14], quoting from
                        <em>Tan Woon Kheng</em> at
                        [15]) if it were
                    to proliferate. Against this, however, it must be remembered
                    that the appellant did not steal someone else’s I/C to
                    commit an offence which caused harm to another person or to
                    the public. He merely used his wife’s I/C, which she
                    had delivered to him for temporary custody while she went to
                    the toilet. The appellant used his wife’s I/C to try
                    to enter the casino because he obviously could not resist
                    the temptation of entering a casino. There was no evidence
                    that he wanted to get into the casino to gamble. It would be
                    reasonable to infer that he wanted to enter the casino in
                    order to gamble, but it might well have been the case that
                    he only wanted to savour the ambience of a
                casino.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Although the mere use of
                    another person’s I/C without lawful authority or
                    reasonable excuse is an offence under s 13(2)(<em>b</em>) of the NRA, the gravity of this
                    offence must depend on the purpose for which the I/C is
                    used, and the sentence imposed by the court must in turn
                    reflect the gravity of the offence. One may misuse another
                    person’s I/C for all kinds of reasons and all kinds of
                    purposes. The s 13(2)(<em>b</em>)
                    NRA offence is an offence that takes its colour or moral
                    culpability from the context in which the unlawful use of
                    another person’s I/C takes place. A teenager who uses
                    her elder sister’s I/C to enter a nightclub may have
                    committed a s 13(2)(<em>b</em>)
                    NRA offence, but a court would not sentence her to
                    imprisonment even though she has misused another
                    person’s I/C. This is because the moral culpability
                    involved in such a s 13(2)(<em>b</em>) NRA offence is slight. Such unlawful use
                    of another person’s I/C is of a totally different
                    complexion from the scenario where a person steals someone
                    else’s I/C in order to enter premises to commit arson,
                    or in order to enter a prohibited place to commit a
                    terrorist act. The sentences imposed in these various
                    scenarios should reflect the different degrees of moral
                    culpability involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       A review of some of the
                    cases on s 13(2)(<em>b</em>) NRA
                    offences shows the court’s discerning approach in this
                    area. In the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Tan Wei Shin</em> [2010] SGDC 53
                        (“<em>Tan Wei
                    Shin</em>”), the accused picked up another
                    person’s I/C. He went to a SingTel shop and used the
                    stolen I/C to apply for a mobile phone plan in the
                    victim’s name. The idea was to obtain and then sell
                    the free iPhone that came with the mobile phone plan. The
                    accused was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment by
                    the District Court. The sentence was reduced to two
                    months’ imprisonment on appeal (see <em>Tan Wei Shin v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    Magistrate’s Appeal No 49 of 2010 (unreported)).
                    The facts of <em>Badahul Zaman Bin Abu Bakar
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008] SGDC 353
                        (“<em>Badahul </em><em>Zaman</em>”) are similar to those
                    in <em>Tan Wei Shin</em>. In <em>Badahul Zaman</em>, the accused used his
                    former mother-in-law’s I/C to apply for a SingTel
                    mobile phone number and thereafter used the mobile phone
                    number without paying the charges incurred. The accused was
                    charged under s 13(2)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the NRA for using his former mother-in-law’s I/C
                    without lawful authority, and also under s 43 of the
                    Telecommunications Act (Cap 323, 2000 Rev Ed) for
                    dishonestly using a telecommunication service with intent to
                    avoid paying the applicable charges. The District Court
                    sentenced the accused to three months’ imprisonment
                    for each charge. On appeal, both charges were substituted
                    with cheating charges under s 420 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), and the sentence for each
                    charge was reduced to six weeks’ imprisonment (see
                        <em>Badahul Zaman Bin Abu Bakar v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> Magistrate’s Appeal
                    No 266 of 2008 (unreported)). Finally, in <em>Cheong Siat Fong v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2005] SGHC 176, the accused stole a blank DBS
                    cheque and an I/C belonging to her friend. She forged a
                    signature on the cheque and used it with the I/C to withdraw
                    almost $40,000 from her friend’s bank account. The
                    District Court’s sentence of three months’
                    imprisonment for the s 13(2)(<em>b</em>) NRA offence was enhanced to 24
                    months’ imprisonment on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Compared with these cases,
                    the custodial sentence imposed on the appellant in the
                    present case was wrong in principle, inappropriate and
                    manifestly excessive, having regard to the circumstances of
                    the case and, in particular, the fact that the only reason
                    why the appellant used his wife’s I/C to try to enter
                    the casino was because he could not do so with his own I/C
                    due to the self-exclusion order in force against him. In
                    order to assess the degree of culpability in such a case, it
                    is first necessary to understand the role of self-exclusion
                    orders in the statutory and regulatory
                framework.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     A self-exclusion order is
                    a species of exclusion order under the all-encompassing
                    regulatory and enforcement framework of the CCA. Its main
                    purpose is to enable persons who consider themselves
                    vulnerable to the temptation of gambling, especially in
                    casinos, to avoid financial harm to themselves (and,
                    indirectly, their families) by voluntarily giving up their
                    right (upon payment of the prescribed levy in the case of
                    Singapore citizens and Singapore permanent residents) to
                    enter casinos. Exclusion orders were created to supplement
                    social safeguards, such as counselling hotlines and
                    addiction management services, that are meant to guard
                    against the proliferation of gambling in casinos. The idea
                    is that if those vulnerable to the temptation of gambling
                    are barred from entering casinos, they cannot harm
                    themselves and/or their families through gambling in
                    casinos. There are five main types of exclusion orders,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     exclusion orders
                        issued by casino operators (see s 120 of the
                        CCA);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     exclusion orders issued by the Casino
                        Regulatory Authority of Singapore (“the Casino
                        Regulatory Authority”) (see s 121 of the
                        CCA);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     exclusion orders issued by the
                        Commissioner of Police (see s 122 of the
                        CCA);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     family exclusion orders issued by the
                        National Council on Problem Gambling (“the
                        NCPG”) (see s 159 of the CCA);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     mandatory exclusion orders issued by the NCPG,
                        which include self-exclusion orders (see
                            s 165A(1)(<em>c</em>) of
                        the CCA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     A self-exclusion order is
                    essentially an exclusion order made pursuant to a voluntary
                    application by a person to the NCPG for himself to be
                    excluded from entering casinos (see s 165A(1)(<em>c</em>) of the CCA). An application for a
                    self-exclusion order can be made quickly and conveniently
                    over the Internet, and is meant to be a self-help remedy.
                    Importantly, a self-exclusion order can be lifted with
                    little fuss by the applicant himself. In this regard,
                    s 165A(3) of the CCA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A person [who has applied for a self-exclusion order]
                        shall be excluded from entering or remaining, or taking
                        part in any gaming, on any casino premises <em>until such time as the person notifies the
                            [NCPG]</em> in the prescribed form and manner
                            <em>that he wishes to cease to be so
                            excluded.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Unlike an application for a self-exclusion order,
                    a notice to cease self-exclusion cannot at present be given
                    to the NCPG via the Internet. Instead, such a notice can
                    only be given to the NCPG by filling up a form available at
                    its office (see r 21 of the Casino Control (Problem
                    Gambling – Exclusion Orders) Rules 2008
                    (S 623/2008)). Clearly, the purpose of the prescribed
                    procedures is to make it easy for people to exclude
                    themselves from casinos, but less easy for them to reverse
                    their decision to apply for self-exclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     To give exclusion orders
                    bite, general enforcement measures are provided for in the
                    CCA. A person who contravenes an exclusion order and enters
                    a casino will forfeit all his winnings (see s 128 of
                    the CCA). Casinos are also under an obligation to ensure
                    that an excluded person (<em>ie</em>, a
                    person barred from entering a casino by an exclusion order
                    (see s 2(1) of the CCA)) does not enter their premises
                    (see ss 126 and 127 of the CCA). It is pertinent that
                    the CCA criminalises breaches of only those exclusion orders
                    issued by the Casino Regulatory Authority and the
                    Commissioner of Police (see s 125(2) of the CCA read
                    with s 195 thereof). In other words, under the CCA, a
                    breach of a self-exclusion order (or a family exclusion
                    order) is <em>in itself</em> not a
                    criminal offence. The non-criminalisation of breaches of
                    self-exclusion orders was a deliberate policy decision. It
                    is not a <em>lacuna</em> or gap in the
                    legislation. The social safeguards implemented by the CCA
                    were reviewed in 2009, and proposals to strengthen them
                    further were tendered to Parliament on 15 September
                    2009. It is notable that none of the proposals was to
                    criminalise breaches of self-exclusion orders (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (15 September 2009) vol 86
                    at cols 1501–1503).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Parliament’s
                    decision not to criminalise breaches of self-exclusion
                    orders is, in my view, highly material to the determination
                    of the proper punishment in cases such as the present. The
                    court must keep in mind the enforcement measures that have
                    already been implemented in the CCA. Casinos are obliged to
                    conduct stringent checks to ensure that excluded persons do
                    not enter their premises. If the barriers erected by the
                    casinos are impermeable to excluded persons, attempts to
                    breach exclusion orders will necessarily be futile. In a
                    sense, it is also just that casinos should bear the brunt of
                    enforcing exclusion orders. In the event that an excluded
                    person makes it past the barriers erected by a casino, all
                    his winnings (if any) will be confiscated if he is
                    discovered. The risk of confiscation severely decreases the
                    incentive for an excluded person to attempt to enter a
                    casino to gamble. If properly implemented, these two
                    enforcement measures reduce the need to criminalise breaches
                    of self-exclusion orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Criminalising breaches of
                    self-exclusion orders will, in any event, lead to an absurd
                    outcome. The result will be that an excluded person who has
                    the foresight to apply to lift his self-exclusion order
                    before going to a casino to gamble is not a criminal, but an
                    excluded person who momentarily succumbs to temptation and
                    enters a casino to gamble despite the self-exclusion order
                    in force against him is. The essential state of mind in both
                    cases is the same: the excluded person feels compelled to go
                    to a casino to gamble. The mere fact that one excluded
                    person has the foresight to plan ahead while the other lacks
                    such foresight should not, in my view, be the determinant of
                    whether a person who enters a casino to gamble is a criminal
                    or an innocent. In the present case, s 13(2)(<em>b</em>) of the NRA is simply the formal
                    avenue by which the appellant’s act of unlawfully
                    using his wife’s I/C is criminalised. The substance of
                    the appellant’s offence is still essentially an
                    attempt to breach a self-exclusion order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Before this court, the
                    Prosecution argued, unthinkingly, that the deterrent
                    custodial sentence imposed by the DJ was appropriate
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the appellant,
                    presumably because he had used his wife’s I/C to try
                    to enter the casino, even though he had no antecedents.
                    Deterrent sentencing should always be viewed in its proper
                    context and used in appropriate circumstances. In my view,
                    the present circumstances did not call for a deterrent
                    sentence. Self-exclusion orders are meant to be a <em>self-help</em> remedy for those
                    vulnerable to the temptation of gambling. Given that
                    Parliament has decided not to criminalise breaches of
                    self-exclusion orders, the courts should be cautious not to
                    let deterrence undermine the self-help regime implemented by
                    Parliament. Too harsh a punishment for an offence which
                    consists, in essence, of breaching or attempting to breach a
                    self-exclusion order will only dissuade those especially
                    vulnerable to the temptation of gambling, who are not
                    confident of resisting such temptation, from applying for a
                    self-exclusion order in the first place. Furthermore, those
                    who are more confident of their ability to resist the
                    temptation of gambling may decide to take their chances with
                    their willpower (<em>viz</em>, by not
                    applying for a self-exclusion order) rather than needlessly
                    run the risk of imprisonment (in the event that they apply
                    for a self-exclusion order and are subsequently prosecuted
                    for an offence which consists essentially of an actual or
                    attempted breach of the self-exclusion order). Persons who
                    are already subject to a self-exclusion order may now decide
                    to lift the order rather than take the risk of being sent to
                    prison if they were to succumb to their gambling compulsion
                    and end up being prosecuted for what is, in essence, a
                    breach or an attempted breach of the order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On a related note, family
                    exclusion orders (taken out by family members if certain
                    conditions are met) are meant to be a non-adversarial means
                    for families to help the problem gamblers in their midst.
                    Deterrence should be sensitively applied in this context as
                    well. Severe sentences for offences which consist
                    essentially of breaching or attempting to breach a family
                    exclusion order may inadvertently lead to greater internal
                    conflict as the offenders concerned may blame their
                    punishment on the family member who applied for the
                    exclusion order. Severe sentences in this context may also
                    have the result of deterring or disincentivising family
                    members from applying for family exclusion orders –
                    nobody wants to see a loved one in prison. Ultimately, as
                    Parliament has recognised, the most effective way of
                    ensuring that exclusion orders are not breached is for
                    casinos to ensure that an excluded person cannot get into
                    their premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the circumstances,
                    since the rule of law must be upheld, I decided that a fine
                    of $3,000 would be appropriate punishment in the present
                    case. This was within the range of fines of $3,000 to $5,000
